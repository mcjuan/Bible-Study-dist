- leviathan, sea monster, dragon
  - large dinosaur-like, aquatic reptile

## Note

Some think this is a crocodile, but from the description in Job 41, this is patently absurd. It appears to be a large fire breathing animal. Just as the bombardier beetle has an explosion producing mechanism, so this great sea dragon also may have had an similar mechanism to enable it to breathe fire.

### **Tagging/Categorization Strategy for Bible Study in Obsidian**

Here’s a comprehensive approach to setting up a tagging and categorization structure that fits your needs:

1. Tags for Study Types

    #study/systematic, #study/thematic, #study/character, #study/place, #study/word, #study/secondary-source, #study/narrative

2. Tags for Bible Books

    #book/genesis, #book/matthew, etc.
    (Consider using internal links for specific chapters instead.)

3. Tags for Themes

    #theme/love, #theme/justice, #theme/grace, #theme/faith, #theme/sin, #theme/covenant, #theme/prophecy, #theme/kingdom-of-god

4. Tags for Word Studies

    #word/hebrew/agape, #word/greek/yahweh
    #language/greek, #language/hebrew, #language/aramaic

5. Tags for Commentary and Sources

    #commentary, with details in YAML front matter or content.

6. Tags for Characters and Places

    #character/david, #character/mary, #character/paul
    #place/jerusalem, #place/babylon, #place/galilee

7. Tags for Personal Application

    #reflection/personal, #reflection/prayer, #reflection/devotional

8. Tags for Cross-References

    #cross-ref/messianic, #cross-ref/prophetic, #cross-ref/thematic

#### **1. Tags for Study Types**

You can create specific tags to categorize the type of study you're conducting. These tags will help you quickly filter and find notes related to different approaches. Consider the following tags:

- **#study/systematic: For notes that involve systematic theological studies (e.g., studies on the nature of God, salvation, sin, etc.).
	- #systematic/chapter
	- #systematic/book
- **#study/thematic**: For thematic studies that focus on recurring themes throughout the Bible (e.g., love, justice, covenant, etc.).
- **#study/character**
- **#study/place
- **#study/word**: For notes that involve deep dives into specific words, their meanings, translations, and usage across different contexts.
- **#study/commentary**: For notes based on commentaries, scholarly analysis, or other secondary sources.
- **#study/story** or **#study/parable**: For notes focusing on specific stories or parables, analyzing their meaning, context, and applications.

#### **2. Tags for Bible Books and Chapters**

Use tags to identify the specific books, chapters, or sections of the Bible that a note relates to. This allows you to quickly filter notes by their scriptural reference:

- **#book-genesis**, **#book-matthew**, etc.: Use book-level tags to quickly identify notes that pertain to specific books of the Bible.
- **#chapter-genesis-1**, **#chapter-psalm-23**, etc.: Use chapter-level tags to categorize more granular notes or studies.

#### **3. Tags for Themes or Topics**

Create tags for major themes or topics you encounter in your studies. These could include:

- **#theme/love**, **#theme/justice**, **#theme/grace**, **#theme/faith**, **#theme/sin**, etc.: These thematic tags allow you to see where a specific theme appears throughout your notes, regardless of the book or study type.
- **#theme/covenant**, **#theme/prophecy**, **#theme/kingdom-of-god**, **#theme/sabbath**, etc.: For more specific topics or theological concepts.

#### **4. Tags for Word Studies**

When conducting word studies, use tags to identify the original language term and its translation:

- **#word/hebrew/agape**, **#word/greek/yahweh**, etc.: Tag the original word or its transliteration.

#### **5. Tags for Commentary and Secondary Sources**

If you are using different commentaries or scholarly works, tag notes based on the source:

- **#commentary/john-calvin**, **#commentary/matthew-henry**, etc.: Tag notes by the specific commentary or author.
- **#scholarship**, **#historical-context**, **#cultural-background**: Tags for notes that delve into the historical, cultural, or academic context of the Bible passages.

#### **6. Tags for Characters and Places**

If you’re studying specific biblical characters, locations, or groups:

- **#character/david**, **#character/mary**, **#character/paul**, etc.: Tags for individual biblical characters.
- **#place/jerusalem**, **#place/babylon**, **#place/galilee**, etc.: Tags for geographical locations mentioned in the Bible.

#### **7. Tags for Personal Application**

If you’re making notes on personal reflections, applications, or prayers based on your studies:

- **#personal-reflection**, **#application**, **#prayer**, **#devotional** **#personal**: Tags to differentiate between interpretative studies and personal applications or meditations.

#### **8. Tags for Cross-References**

Create tags to mark when a note contains cross-references to other parts of the Bible:

- **#cross-reference**: General tag for notes that list or discuss cross-references.
- **#cross-reference-messianic**, **#cross-reference-prophetic**, etc.: Specific tags for types of cross-references.

### **Creating Structure Notes and Links**

In addition to tagging, you can also create **Structure Notes** or **Hub Notes** to serve as indexes for various study types, topics, or books:

- **Structure Note for Each Study Type**: Create a note like "Systematic Theology Overview" or "Word Study Index" that links to individual notes within that category.
- **Structure Note for Each Theme**: Create a note like "Theme: Love" that contains links to every note that discusses love in different contexts (systematic study, thematic study, word study, etc.).
- **Structure Note for Each Bible Book**: Create a note for each book of the Bible (e.g., "Genesis Study Notes") that links to your chapter notes, thematic notes, and other relevant studies.

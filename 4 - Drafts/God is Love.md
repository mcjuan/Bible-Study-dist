God is not angry with us. Jesus became sin and was crucified to defeat sin. All of God's wrath was pinned on the cross, and for him to be angry or wrought with us today is to deny the sacrifice of Jesus.

God created us out of love, and not necessity.

What is Love?


**"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day."**  
â€” **John 6:44** (KJV)

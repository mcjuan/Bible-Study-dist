King Herod felt disturbed by the news of the birth of Jesus because he saw it as a threat to his rule. His reaction was filled with anger and violence, and led to the massacre of innocent baby children. In contrast, we see Jesus born into humble and unassuming circumstances and was named a King even as newborn. We see that through Jesus God demonstrates Kingship without the need for worldly standards of  money, status, and influence.


The religious leaders knew where the Messiah was to be born but made no effort to seek Him. Why do you think they responded this way?


The religious leaders knew the prophecy from [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/33 - Micah/Micah 5#2|Micah 5:2]] “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, *Though* you are little among the thousands of Judah, *Yet* out of you shall come forth to Me The One to be Ruler in Israel,  Whose goings forth *are* from of old, From everlasting.”, that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, yet they made no effort to seek Him when they heard about His birth.

This reflects their spiritual blindness and indifference. Though they had "head"-knowledge, their hearts were not in the right place to receive the truth and therefore believe and seek. 
They may have also been fearful of acknowledging a new "king" while under Herod who was notorious for his cruelty. They sought after their own physical safety over the Messiah.

Thus, they exhibited no faith. [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/45 - Romans/Romans 10#17|Romans 10:17]] 
"So then faith *comes* by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." 
However:
Faith also requires response and action. [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/59 - James/James 2#17|James 2:17]] 
"Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead."


[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/19 - Psalms/Psalms 37#4|Psalms 37:4]] 
Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart.

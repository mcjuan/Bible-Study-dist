# 2. Breakdown
~*Break up the chapter in sections, and give an analysis and explanation (rename the section titles)*
## v.1-6 John the Baptist’s Ministry
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#1|Matthew 3:1-6]] 
	[1]In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
	[2]and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!”
	[3]For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:  “The voice of one crying in the wilderness:  ‘Prepare the way of the *LORD*; Make His paths straight.’ ”
	[4]Now John himself was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
	[5]Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him
	[6]and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#2|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#3|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#4|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#5|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#6|]]
**John the Baptist** emerges as the **forerunner of the Messiah**, preaching repentance in the wilderness of Judaea. His message, "Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#2|Matthew 3:2]], is central to his ministry. 
John's role fulfills the prophecy of [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/23 - Isaiah/Isaiah 40#3|Isaiah 40:3]] 
	[3]The voice of one crying in the wilderness:  “Prepare the way of the LORD;  Make straight in the desert A highway for our God.

His appearance—wearing **camel’s hair** and eating **locusts and wild honey** (v. 4)—is reminiscent of the prophet **Elijah** [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/12 - 2 Kings/2 Kings 1#8|2 Kings 1:8]], indicating John's prophetic identity and his call for spiritual renewal.

John's baptism was a **baptism of repentance** [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#6|Matthew 3:6]], symbolizing the cleansing of sin and a readiness for the coming of the Messiah. 

The location in the wilderness represents a place of preparation and transformation, much like Israel’s journey through the wilderness in [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/2 - Exodus/Exodus 13#18|Exodus 13:18]]. [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/2 - Exodus/Exodus 16|Exodus 16]]

It also foreshadows the spiritual cleansing that Jesus would bring [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/26 - Ezekiel/Ezekiel 36#25|Ezekiel 36:25-27]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/26 - Ezekiel/Ezekiel 36#26|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/26 - Ezekiel/Ezekiel 36#27|]]. Baptism was common for purification in Jewish custom, but John's baptism emphasized a personal turning to God.

## v.7-12 John’s Confrontation with the Pharisees and Sadducees
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#7|Matthew 3:7-12]] 
	[7]But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
	[8]Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,
	[9]and do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as *our* father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
	[10]And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
	[11]I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
	[12]His winnowing fan *is* in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#8|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#9|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#10|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#11|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#12|]]
John addresses the Pharisees and Sadducees, religious leaders who approach his baptism. John rebukes them, calling them a "generation of vipers" (v. 7), indicating their hypocrisy and spiritual blindness. 

These leaders were relying on their heritage as descendants of Abraham (v. 9) to secure their salvation, but John warns them that God’s judgment is imminent. He insists that their lives must bear fruit worthy of repentance (v. 8), meaning that true repentance leads to a changed life, not merely ritualistic observances.

John further warns that the Messiah is coming and will bring judgment. His winnowing fork will separate the wheat from the chaff, the righteous from the wicked (v. 12). This separation symbolizes divine judgment, with the righteous gathered into the kingdom and the unrepentant burned in unquenchable fire.

[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/45 - Romans/Romans 2#28|Romans 2:28-29]] 
	[28]For he is not a Jew who *is* *one* outwardly, nor *is* circumcision that which *is* outward in the flesh;
	[29]but *he* *is* a Jew who *is* *one* inwardly; and circumcision *is* *that* of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise *is* not from men but from God.
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/45 - Romans/Romans 2#29|]]
Paul explains that true righteousness is inward, not merely outward observance or descent from Abraham.

[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/42 - Luke/Luke 11#39|Luke 11:39-40]] 
	[39]Then the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean, but  your inward part is full of greed and wickedness.
	[40]Foolish ones! Did not  He who made the outside make the inside also?
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/42 - Luke/Luke 11#40|]]
Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for their hypocrisy.

[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 7#19|Matthew 7:19]] 
	[19]Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

Jesus repeats John’s teaching.

[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/39 - Malachi/Malachi 4#1|Malachi 4:1]] 
	[1]“For behold, the day is coming, Burning like an oven, And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up,” Says the LORD of hosts, “That will leave them neither root nor branch.

A prophetic image of God’s coming judgment, which John alludes to with his language of burning chaff.

## v.13-17 The Baptism of Jesus
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#13|Matthew 3:13-17]] 
	[13]Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.
	[14]And John *tried* *to* prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?”
	[15]But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit *it to be so* now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him.
	[16]When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.
	[17]And suddenly a voice *came* from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#14|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#15|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#16|]][[8 - Bibles/NKJV/40 - Matthew/Matthew 3#17|]]
### Baptism as Righteous Obedience
Jesus comes from Galilee to be baptized by John, not because He needed repentance, but to “fulfil all righteousness” (v. 15). This act is an identification with sinful humanity and the beginning of His redemptive work.

Jesus’ submission to baptism demonstrates His complete obedience to the will of the Father. Although sinless, He aligns Himself with humanity, pointing to His future work on the cross, where He would take on the sins of the world.
[[8 - Bibles/NKJV/47 - 2 Corinthians/2 Corinthians 5#21|2 Corinthians 5:21]]
	[21]For He made Him who knew no sin *to* *be* sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
### The Dove and Jesus' Divine Sonship
The Holy Spirit descends like a dove, and a voice from heaven declares, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (v. 17). This divine approval affirms Jesus’ identity as the Son of God and His role as the suffering servant prophesied in [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/23 - Isaiah/Isaiah 42#1|Isaiah 42:1]]: 
	[1]“Behold! My Servant whom I uphold, My Elect One *in* *whom* My soul delights!  I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the Gentiles.

The dove is a symbol of peace and purity, representing the Spirit’s gentle, empowering presence in Jesus’ ministry. It also hearkens back to [[8 - Bibles/NKJV/1 - Genesis/Genesis 8#11|Genesis 8:11]], where the dove brings Noah a sign of peace after the flood, symbolizing new beginnings, which Jesus’ ministry represents for the world.

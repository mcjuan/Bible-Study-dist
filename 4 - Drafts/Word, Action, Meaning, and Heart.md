Actions give meaning to your words. 
and words express commitment to the meaning in your heart.

with your heart you mean, and with your words you commit to that meaning. 
then you uphold that meaning by your actions. thus, you enforce meaning in your heart by your actions.

but, when you speak the Word of God, which are His promises, the actions have already been fulfilled. it is complete. but because the meaning of His Word has not been made complete in your heart and mind, it produces varying degrees of effect.

A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>, when he changed<S>8138</S> his behaviour<S>2940</S> before<S>6440</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>; who drove him away<S>1644</S>, and he departed<S>3212</S>. I will bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> at all times<S>6256</S>: his praise<S>8416</S> shall continually<S>8548</S> be in my mouth<S>6310</S>. <sup>Abimelech: or, Achish</sup>
My soul<S>5315</S> shall make her boast<S>1984</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S>: the humble<S>6035</S> shall hear<S>8085</S> thereof, and be glad<S>8055</S>.
O magnify<S>1431</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with me, and let us exalt<S>7311</S> his name<S>8034</S> together<S>3162</S>.
I sought<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and he heard<S>6030</S> me, and delivered<S>5337</S> me from all my fears<S>4035</S>.
They looked<S>5027</S> unto him, and were lightened<S>5102</S>: and their faces<S>6440</S> were not ashamed<S>2659</S>. <sup>were lightened: or, they flowed unto him</sup>
This poor man<S>6041</S> cried<S>7121</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> heard<S>8085</S> him, and saved<S>3467</S> him out of all his troubles<S>6869</S>.
The angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> encampeth<S>2583</S> round about<S>5439</S> them that fear<S>3373</S> him, and delivereth<S>2502</S> them.
O taste<S>2938</S> and see<S>7200</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> is good<S>2896</S>: blessed<S>835</S> is the man<S>1397</S> that trusteth<S>2620</S> in him.
O fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, ye his saints<S>6918</S>: for there is no want<S>4270</S> to them that fear<S>3373</S> him.
The young lions<S>3715</S> do lack<S>7326</S>, and suffer hunger<S>7456</S>: but they that seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> shall not want<S>2637</S> any good<S>2896</S> thing.
Come<S>3212</S>, ye children<S>1121</S>, hearken<S>8085</S> unto me: I will teach<S>3925</S> you the fear<S>3374</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
What man<S>376</S> is he that desireth<S>2655</S> life<S>2416</S>, and loveth<S>157</S> many days<S>3117</S>, that he may see<S>7200</S> good<S>2896</S>?
Keep<S>5341</S> thy tongue<S>3956</S> from evil<S>7451</S>, and thy lips<S>8193</S> from speaking<S>1696</S> guile<S>4820</S>.
Depart<S>5493</S> from evil<S>7451</S>, and do<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>; seek<S>1245</S> peace<S>7965</S>, and pursue<S>7291</S> it.
The eyes<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> are upon the righteous<S>6662</S>, and his ears<S>241</S> are open unto their cry<S>7775</S>.
The face<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is against them that do<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S>, to cut off<S>3772</S> the remembrance<S>2143</S> of them from the earth<S>776</S>.
The righteous cry<S>6817</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> heareth<S>8085</S>, and delivereth<S>5337</S> them out of all their troubles<S>6869</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is nigh<S>7138</S> unto them that are of a broken<S>7665</S> heart<S>3820</S>; and saveth<S>3467</S> such as be of a contrite<S>1793</S> spirit<S>7307</S>. <sup>unto: Heb. to the broken of heart</sup> <sup>of a contrite: Heb. contrite of spirit</sup>
Many<S>7227</S> are the afflictions<S>7451</S> of the righteous<S>6662</S>: but the LORD<S>3068</S> delivereth<S>5337</S> him out of them all.
He keepeth<S>8104</S> all his bones<S>6106</S>: not one<S>259</S> of them<S>2007</S> is broken<S>7665</S>.
Evil<S>7451</S> shall slay<S>4191</S> the wicked<S>7563</S>: and they that hate<S>8130</S> the righteous<S>6662</S> shall be desolate<S>816</S>. <sup>desolate: or, guilty</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> redeemeth<S>6299</S> the soul<S>5315</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>: and none of them that trust<S>2620</S> in him shall be desolate<S>816</S>. <sup>desolate: or, guilty</sup>

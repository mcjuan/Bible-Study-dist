Now Korah<S>7141</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Izhar<S>3324</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Kohath<S>6955</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>, and Dathan<S>1885</S> and Abiram<S>48</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Eliab<S>446</S>, and On<S>203</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Peleth<S>6431</S>, sons<S>1121</S> of Reuben<S>7205</S>, took<S>3947</S> men:
And they rose up<S>6965</S> before<S>6440</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, with certain<S>582</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, two hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> princes<S>5387</S> of the assembly<S>5712</S>, famous<S>7148</S> in the congregation<S>4150</S>, men<S>582</S> of renown<S>8034</S>:
And they gathered themselves together<S>6950</S> against Moses<S>4872</S> and against Aaron<S>175</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Ye take too much<S>7227</S> upon you, seeing all the congregation<S>5712</S> are holy<S>6918</S>, every one of them, and the LORD<S>3068</S> is among<S>8432</S> them: wherefore then lift ye up<S>5375</S> yourselves above the congregation<S>6951</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>? <sup>Ye take: Heb. It is much for you</sup>
And when Moses<S>4872</S> heard<S>8085</S> it, he fell<S>5307</S> upon his face<S>6440</S>:
And he spake<S>1696</S> unto Korah<S>7141</S> and unto all his company<S>5712</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Even to morrow<S>1242</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> will shew<S>3045</S> who are his, and who is holy<S>6918</S>; and will cause him to come near<S>7126</S> unto him: even him whom he hath chosen<S>977</S> will he cause to come near<S>7126</S> unto him.
This do<S>6213</S>; Take<S>3947</S> you censers<S>4289</S>, Korah<S>7141</S>, and all his company<S>5712</S>;
And put<S>5414</S> fire<S>784</S> therein<S>2004</S>, and put<S>7760</S> incense<S>7004</S> in them before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> to morrow<S>4279</S>: and it shall be that the man<S>376</S> whom the LORD<S>3068</S> doth choose<S>977</S>, he shall be holy<S>6918</S>: ye take too much<S>7227</S> upon you, ye sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Korah<S>7141</S>, Hear<S>8085</S>, I pray you, ye sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>:
Seemeth it but a small thing<S>4592</S> unto you, that the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> hath separated<S>914</S> you from the congregation<S>5712</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, to bring you near<S>7126</S> to himself to do<S>5647</S> the service<S>5656</S> of the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and to stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the congregation<S>5712</S> to minister<S>8334</S> unto them?
And he hath brought thee near<S>7126</S> to him, and all thy brethren<S>251</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S> with thee: and seek<S>1245</S> ye the priesthood<S>3550</S> also?
For which cause<S>3651</S> both thou and all thy company<S>5712</S> are gathered together<S>3259</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>: and what is Aaron<S>175</S>, that ye murmur<S>3885</S> <S>3885</S> against him?
And Moses<S>4872</S> sent<S>7971</S> to call<S>7121</S> Dathan<S>1885</S> and Abiram<S>48</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Eliab<S>446</S>: which said<S>559</S>, We will not come up<S>5927</S>:
Is it a small thing<S>4592</S> that<S>3588</S> thou hast brought us up<S>5927</S> out of a land<S>776</S> that floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>, to kill<S>4191</S> us in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, except thou make<S>8323</S> thyself altogether<S>8323</S> a prince<S>8323</S> over us?
Moreover<S>637</S> thou hast not brought<S>935</S> us into a land<S>776</S> that floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>, or given<S>5414</S> us inheritance<S>5159</S> of fields<S>7704</S> and vineyards<S>3754</S>: wilt thou put out<S>5365</S> the eyes<S>5869</S> of these men<S>582</S>? we will not come up<S>5927</S>. <sup>put: Heb. bore out</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> was very<S>3966</S> wroth<S>2734</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, Respect<S>6437</S> not thou their offering<S>4503</S>: I have not taken<S>5375</S> one<S>259</S> ass<S>2543</S> from them, neither have I hurt<S>7489</S> one<S>259</S> of them.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Korah<S>7141</S>, Be thou and all thy company<S>5712</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, thou, and they, and Aaron<S>175</S>, to morrow<S>4279</S>:
And take<S>3947</S> every man<S>376</S> his censer<S>4289</S>, and put<S>5414</S> incense<S>7004</S> in them, and bring<S>7126</S> ye before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> every man<S>376</S> his censer<S>4289</S>, two hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> censers<S>4289</S>; thou also, and Aaron<S>175</S>, each<S>376</S> of you his censer<S>4289</S>.
And they took<S>3947</S> every man<S>376</S> his censer<S>4289</S>, and put<S>5414</S> fire<S>784</S> in them, and laid<S>7760</S> incense<S>7004</S> thereon, and stood<S>5975</S> in the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S> with Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>.
And Korah<S>7141</S> gathered<S>6950</S> all the congregation<S>5712</S> against them unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>: and the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> appeared<S>7200</S> unto all the congregation<S>5712</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and unto Aaron<S>175</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Separate<S>914</S> yourselves from among<S>8432</S> this congregation<S>5712</S>, that I may consume<S>3615</S> them in a moment<S>7281</S>.
And they fell<S>5307</S> upon their faces<S>6440</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O God<S>410</S>, the God<S>430</S> of the spirits<S>7307</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S>, shall one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> sin<S>2398</S>, and wilt thou be wroth<S>7107</S> with all the congregation<S>5712</S>?
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>1696</S> unto the congregation<S>5712</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Get you up<S>5927</S> from about<S>5439</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>, Dathan<S>1885</S>, and Abiram<S>48</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> rose up<S>6965</S> and went<S>3212</S> unto Dathan<S>1885</S> and Abiram<S>48</S>; and the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> followed<S>3212</S> him<S>310</S>.
And he spake<S>1696</S> unto the congregation<S>5712</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Depart<S>5493</S>, I pray you, from the tents<S>168</S> of these wicked<S>7563</S> men<S>582</S>, and touch<S>5060</S> nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed<S>5595</S> in all their sins<S>2403</S>.
So they gat up<S>5927</S> from the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>, Dathan<S>1885</S>, and Abiram<S>48</S>, on every side<S>5439</S>: and Dathan<S>1885</S> and Abiram<S>48</S> came out<S>3318</S>, and stood<S>5324</S> in the door<S>6607</S> of their tents<S>168</S>, and their wives<S>802</S>, and their sons<S>1121</S>, and their little children<S>2945</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Hereby ye shall know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> me to do<S>6213</S> all these works<S>4639</S>; for I have not done them of mine own mind<S>3820</S>.
If these men die<S>4191</S> the common death<S>4194</S> of all men<S>120</S>, or if they be visited<S>6485</S> after the visitation<S>6486</S> of all men<S>120</S>; then the LORD<S>3068</S> hath not sent<S>7971</S> me. <sup>the common: Heb. as every man dieth</sup>
But if the LORD<S>3068</S> make<S>1254</S> a new thing<S>1278</S>, and the earth<S>127</S> open<S>6475</S> her mouth<S>6310</S>, and swallow them up<S>1104</S>, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down<S>3381</S> quick<S>2416</S> into the pit<S>7585</S>; then ye shall understand<S>3045</S> that these men<S>582</S> have provoked<S>5006</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>make: Heb. create a creature</sup>
And it came to pass, as he had made an end<S>3615</S> of speaking<S>1696</S> all these words<S>1697</S>, that the ground<S>127</S> clave asunder<S>1234</S> that was under them:
And the earth<S>776</S> opened<S>6605</S> her mouth<S>6310</S>, and swallowed them up<S>1104</S>, and their houses<S>1004</S>, and all the men<S>120</S> that appertained unto Korah<S>7141</S>, and all their goods<S>7399</S>.
They, and all that appertained to them, went down<S>3381</S> alive<S>2416</S> into the pit<S>7585</S>, and the earth<S>776</S> closed<S>3680</S> upon them: and they perished<S>6</S> from among<S>8432</S> the congregation<S>6951</S>.
And all Israel<S>3478</S> that were round about<S>5439</S> them fled<S>5127</S> at the cry<S>6963</S> of them: for they said<S>559</S>, Lest the earth<S>776</S> swallow us up<S>1104</S> also.
And there came out<S>3318</S> a fire<S>784</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, and consumed<S>398</S> the two hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> men<S>376</S> that offered<S>7126</S> incense<S>7004</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>559</S> unto Eleazar<S>499</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Aaron<S>175</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, that he take up<S>7311</S> the censers<S>4289</S> out<S>996</S> of the burning<S>8316</S>, and scatter<S>2219</S> thou the fire<S>784</S> yonder<S>1973</S>; for they are hallowed<S>6942</S>.
The censers<S>4289</S> of these sinners<S>2400</S> against their own souls<S>5315</S>, let them make<S>6213</S> them broad<S>7555</S> plates<S>6341</S> for a covering<S>6826</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>: for they offered<S>7126</S> them before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, therefore they are hallowed<S>6942</S>: and they shall be a sign<S>226</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S> took<S>3947</S> the brasen<S>5178</S> censers<S>4289</S>, wherewith they that were burnt<S>8313</S> had offered<S>7126</S>; and they were made broad<S>7554</S> plates for a covering<S>6826</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>:
To be a memorial<S>2146</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that<S>834</S> <S>4616</S> no stranger<S>376</S> <S>2114</S>, which is not of the seed<S>2233</S> of Aaron<S>175</S>, come near<S>7126</S> to offer<S>6999</S> incense<S>7004</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; that he be not as Korah<S>7141</S>, and as his company<S>5712</S>: as the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> to him by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>.
But on the morrow<S>4283</S> all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> murmured<S>3885</S> against Moses<S>4872</S> and against Aaron<S>175</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Ye have killed<S>4191</S> the people<S>5971</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And it came to pass, when the congregation<S>5712</S> was gathered<S>6950</S> against Moses<S>4872</S> and against Aaron<S>175</S>, that they looked<S>6437</S> toward the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>: and, behold, the cloud<S>6051</S> covered<S>3680</S> it, and the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> appeared<S>7200</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> came<S>935</S> before<S>6440</S> the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Get you up<S>7426</S> from among<S>8432</S> this congregation<S>5712</S>, that I may consume<S>3615</S> them as in a moment<S>7281</S>. And they fell<S>5307</S> upon their faces<S>6440</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Take<S>3947</S> a censer<S>4289</S>, and put<S>5414</S> fire<S>784</S> therein from off<S>6440</S> the altar<S>4196</S>, and put<S>7760</S> on incense<S>7004</S>, and go<S>3212</S> quickly<S>4120</S> unto the congregation<S>5712</S>, and make an atonement<S>3722</S> for them: for there is wrath<S>7110</S> gone out<S>3318</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>; the plague<S>5063</S> is begun<S>2490</S>.
And Aaron<S>175</S> took<S>3947</S> as Moses<S>4872</S> commanded<S>1696</S>, and ran<S>7323</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of the congregation<S>6951</S>; and, behold, the plague<S>5063</S> was begun<S>2490</S> among the people<S>5971</S>: and he put<S>5414</S> on incense<S>7004</S>, and made an atonement<S>3722</S> for the people<S>5971</S>.
And he stood<S>5975</S> between the dead<S>4191</S> and the living<S>2416</S>; and the plague<S>4046</S> was stayed<S>6113</S>.
Now they that died<S>4191</S> in the plague<S>4046</S> were fourteen<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> thousand<S>505</S> and seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S>, beside them that died<S>4191</S> about the matter<S>1697</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>.
And Aaron<S>175</S> returned<S>7725</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>: and the plague<S>4046</S> was stayed<S>6113</S>.

And Sarah<S>8283</S> was an hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and seven<S>7651</S> <S>8141</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>2416</S>: these were the years<S>8141</S> of the life<S>2416</S> of Sarah<S>8283</S>.
And Sarah<S>8283</S> died<S>4191</S> in Kirjatharba<S>7153</S>; the same is Hebron<S>2275</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>: and Abraham<S>85</S> came<S>935</S> to mourn<S>5594</S> for Sarah<S>8283</S>, and to weep<S>1058</S> for her.
And Abraham<S>85</S> stood up<S>6965</S> from before<S>6440</S> his dead<S>4191</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> unto the sons<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
I am a stranger<S>1616</S> and a sojourner<S>8453</S> with you: give<S>5414</S> me a possession<S>272</S> of a buryingplace<S>6913</S> with you, that I may bury<S>6912</S> my dead<S>4191</S> out of my sight<S>6440</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S> answered<S>6030</S> Abraham<S>85</S>, saying<S>559</S> unto him,
Hear us<S>8085</S>, my lord<S>113</S>: thou art a mighty<S>430</S> prince<S>5387</S> among us<S>8432</S>: in the choice<S>4005</S> of our sepulchres<S>6913</S> bury<S>6912</S> thy dead<S>4191</S>; none<S>3808</S> <S>376</S> of us shall withhold<S>3607</S> from thee his sepulchre<S>6913</S>, but that thou mayest bury<S>6912</S> thy dead<S>4191</S>. <sup>a mighty: Heb. a prince of God</sup>
And Abraham<S>85</S> stood up<S>6965</S>, and bowed<S>7812</S> himself to the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, even to the children<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>.
And he communed<S>1696</S> with them, saying<S>559</S>, If it be<S>3426</S> your mind<S>5315</S> that I should bury<S>6912</S> my dead<S>4191</S> out of my sight<S>6440</S>; hear<S>8085</S> me, and intreat<S>6293</S> for me to Ephron<S>6085</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zohar<S>6714</S>,
That he may give<S>5414</S> me the cave<S>4631</S> of Machpelah<S>4375</S>, which he hath, which is in the end<S>7097</S> of his field<S>7704</S>; for as much<S>4392</S> money<S>3701</S> as it is worth<S>4392</S> he shall give it<S>5414</S> me for a possession<S>272</S> of a buryingplace<S>6913</S> amongst you<S>8432</S>. <sup>as much: Heb. full money</sup>
And Ephron<S>6085</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> among<S>8432</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>: and Ephron<S>6085</S> the Hittite<S>2850</S> answered<S>6030</S> Abraham<S>85</S> in the audience<S>241</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>, even of all that went in<S>935</S> at the gate<S>8179</S> of his city<S>5892</S>, saying<S>559</S>, <sup>audience: Heb. ears</sup>
Nay<S>3808</S>, my lord<S>113</S>, hear me<S>8085</S>: the field<S>7704</S> give I<S>5414</S> thee, and the cave<S>4631</S> that is therein, I give it<S>5414</S> thee; in the presence<S>5869</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of my people<S>5971</S> give<S>5414</S> I it thee: bury<S>6912</S> thy dead<S>4191</S>.
And Abraham<S>85</S> bowed down<S>7812</S> himself before<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
And he spake<S>1696</S> unto Ephron<S>6085</S> in the audience<S>241</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, saying<S>559</S>, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee<S>3863</S>, hear<S>8085</S> me: I will give<S>5414</S> thee money<S>3701</S> for the field<S>7704</S>; take<S>3947</S> it of me, and I will bury<S>6912</S> my dead<S>4191</S> there.
And Ephron<S>6085</S> answered<S>6030</S> Abraham<S>85</S>, saying<S>559</S> unto him,
My lord<S>113</S>, hearken<S>8085</S> unto me: the land<S>776</S> is worth four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> shekels<S>8255</S> of silver<S>3701</S>; what is that betwixt<S>996</S> me and thee? bury<S>6912</S> therefore thy dead<S>4191</S>.
And Abraham<S>85</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto Ephron<S>6085</S>; and Abraham<S>85</S> weighed<S>8254</S> to Ephron<S>6085</S> the silver<S>3701</S>, which he had named<S>1696</S> in the audience<S>241</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>, four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> shekels<S>8255</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, current<S>5674</S> money with the merchant<S>5503</S>.
And the field<S>7704</S> of Ephron<S>6085</S>, which was in Machpelah<S>4375</S>, which was before<S>6440</S> Mamre<S>4471</S>, the field<S>7704</S>, and the cave<S>4631</S> which was therein, and all the trees<S>6086</S> that were in the field<S>7704</S>, that were in all the borders<S>1366</S> round about<S>5439</S>, were made sure<S>6965</S>
Unto Abraham<S>85</S> for a possession<S>4736</S> in the presence<S>5869</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>, before all that went in<S>935</S> at the gate<S>8179</S> of his city<S>5892</S>.
And after<S>310</S> this<S>3651</S>, Abraham<S>85</S> buried<S>6912</S> Sarah<S>8283</S> his wife<S>802</S> in the cave<S>4631</S> of the field<S>7704</S> of Machpelah<S>4375</S> before<S>6440</S> Mamre<S>4471</S>: the same is Hebron<S>2275</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>.
And the field<S>7704</S>, and the cave<S>4631</S> that is therein, were made sure<S>6965</S> unto Abraham<S>85</S> for a possession<S>272</S> of a buryingplace<S>6913</S> by the sons<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>.

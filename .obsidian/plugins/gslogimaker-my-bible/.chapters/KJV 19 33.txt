Rejoice<S>7442</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S>, O ye righteous<S>6662</S>: for praise<S>8416</S> is comely<S>5000</S> for the upright<S>3477</S>.
Praise<S>3034</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with harp<S>3658</S>: sing<S>2167</S> unto him with the psaltery<S>5035</S> and an instrument of ten strings<S>6218</S>.
Sing<S>7891</S> unto him a new<S>2319</S> song<S>7892</S>; play<S>5059</S> skilfully<S>3190</S> with a loud noise<S>8643</S>.
For the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is right<S>3477</S>; and all his works<S>4639</S> are done in truth<S>530</S>.
He loveth<S>157</S> righteousness<S>6666</S> and judgment<S>4941</S>: the earth<S>776</S> is full<S>4390</S> of the goodness<S>2617</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>goodness: or, mercy</sup>
By the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> were the heavens<S>8064</S> made<S>6213</S>; and all the host<S>6635</S> of them by the breath<S>7307</S> of his mouth<S>6310</S>.
He gathereth<S>3664</S> the waters<S>4325</S> of the sea<S>3220</S> together as an heap<S>5067</S>: he layeth up<S>5414</S> the depth<S>8415</S> in storehouses<S>214</S>.
Let all the earth<S>776</S> fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: let all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the world<S>8398</S> stand in awe<S>1481</S> of him.
For he spake<S>559</S>, and it was done; he commanded<S>6680</S>, and it stood fast<S>5975</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> bringeth<S>6331</S> the counsel<S>6098</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S> to nought<S>6331</S>: he maketh<S>5106</S> the devices<S>4284</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of none effect<S>5106</S>. <sup>bringeth: Heb. maketh frustrate</sup>
The counsel<S>6098</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> standeth<S>5975</S> for ever<S>5769</S>, the thoughts<S>4284</S> of his heart<S>3820</S> to all<S>1755</S> generations<S>1755</S>. <sup>to all: Heb. to generation and generation</sup>
Blessed<S>835</S> is the nation<S>1471</S> whose God<S>430</S> is the LORD<S>3068</S>; and the people<S>5971</S> whom he hath chosen<S>977</S> for his own inheritance<S>5159</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> looketh<S>5027</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>; he beholdeth<S>7200</S> all the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>.
From the place<S>4349</S> of his habitation<S>3427</S> he looketh<S>7688</S> upon all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
He fashioneth<S>3335</S> their hearts<S>3820</S> alike<S>3162</S>; he considereth<S>995</S> all their works<S>4639</S>.
There is no king<S>4428</S> saved<S>3467</S> by the multitude<S>7230</S> of an host<S>2428</S>: a mighty man<S>1368</S> is not delivered<S>5337</S> by much<S>7230</S> strength<S>3581</S>.
An horse<S>5483</S> is a vain thing<S>8267</S> for safety<S>8668</S>: neither shall he deliver<S>4422</S> any by his great<S>7230</S> strength<S>2428</S>.
Behold, the eye<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is upon them that fear<S>3373</S> him, upon them that hope<S>3176</S> in his mercy<S>2617</S>;
To deliver<S>5337</S> their soul<S>5315</S> from death<S>4194</S>, and to keep them alive<S>2421</S> in famine<S>7458</S>.
Our soul<S>5315</S> waiteth<S>2442</S> for the LORD<S>3068</S>: he is our help<S>5828</S> and our shield<S>4043</S>.
For our heart<S>3820</S> shall rejoice<S>8055</S> in him, because we have trusted<S>982</S> in his holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>.
Let thy mercy<S>2617</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, be upon us, according as we hope<S>3176</S> in thee.

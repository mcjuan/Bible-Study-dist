A Psalm<S>4210</S> of praise<S>8426</S>. Make a joyful noise<S>7321</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, all ye lands<S>776</S>. <sup>praise: or, thanksgiving</sup> <sup>all: Heb. all the earth</sup>
Serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with gladness<S>8057</S>: come<S>935</S> before his presence<S>6440</S> with singing<S>7445</S>.
Know<S>3045</S> ye that the LORD<S>3068</S> he is God<S>430</S>: it is he that hath made<S>6213</S> us, and not we ourselves; we are his people<S>5971</S>, and the sheep<S>6629</S> of his pasture<S>4830</S>. <sup>and not: or, and his we are</sup>
Enter<S>935</S> into his gates<S>8179</S> with thanksgiving<S>8426</S>, and into his courts<S>2691</S> with praise<S>8416</S>: be thankful<S>3034</S> unto him, and bless<S>1288</S> his name<S>8034</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> is good<S>2896</S>; his mercy<S>2617</S> is everlasting<S>5769</S>; and his truth<S>530</S> endureth to all<S>1755</S> generations<S>1755</S>. <sup>to all: Heb. to generation and generation</sup>

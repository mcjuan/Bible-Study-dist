And the Spirit<S>7307</S> of God<S>430</S> came upon Azariah<S>5838</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Oded<S>5752</S>:
And he went out<S>3318</S> to meet<S>6440</S> Asa<S>609</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Hear<S>8085</S> ye me, Asa<S>609</S>, and all Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>; The LORD<S>3068</S> is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek<S>1875</S> him, he will be found<S>4672</S> of you; but if ye forsake<S>5800</S> him, he will forsake<S>5800</S> you. <sup>to meet: Heb. before Asa</sup>
Now for a long<S>7227</S> season<S>3117</S> Israel<S>3478</S> hath been without<S>3808</S> the true<S>571</S> God<S>430</S>, and without a teaching<S>3384</S> priest<S>3548</S>, and without law<S>8451</S>.
But when they in their trouble<S>6862</S> did turn<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and sought<S>1245</S> him, he was found<S>4672</S> of them.
And in those times<S>6256</S> there was no peace<S>7965</S> to him that went out<S>3318</S>, nor to him that came in<S>935</S>, but great<S>7227</S> vexations<S>4103</S> were upon all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the countries<S>776</S>.
And nation<S>1471</S> was destroyed<S>3807</S> of nation<S>1471</S>, and city<S>5892</S> of city<S>5892</S>: for God<S>430</S> did vex<S>2000</S> them with all adversity<S>6869</S>. <sup>destroyed: Heb. beaten in pieces</sup>
Be ye strong<S>2388</S> therefore, and let not your hands<S>3027</S> be weak<S>7503</S>: for your work<S>6468</S> shall be<S>3426</S> rewarded<S>7939</S>.
And when Asa<S>609</S> heard<S>8085</S> these words<S>1697</S>, and the prophecy<S>5016</S> of Oded<S>5752</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, he took courage<S>2388</S>, and put away<S>5674</S> the abominable idols<S>8251</S> out of all the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>, and out of the cities<S>5892</S> which he had taken<S>3920</S> from mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, and renewed<S>2318</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that was before<S>6440</S> the porch<S>197</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>abominable: Heb. abominations</sup>
And he gathered<S>6908</S> all Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>, and the strangers<S>1481</S> with them out of Ephraim<S>669</S> and Manasseh<S>4519</S>, and out of Simeon<S>8095</S>: for they fell<S>5307</S> to him out of Israel<S>3478</S> in abundance<S>7230</S>, when they saw<S>7200</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S> was with him.
So they gathered themselves together<S>6908</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S> in the third<S>7992</S> month<S>2320</S>, in the fifteenth<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S> of the reign<S>4438</S> of Asa<S>609</S>.
And they offered<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> the same time<S>3117</S>, of the spoil<S>7998</S> which they had brought<S>935</S>, seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> oxen<S>1241</S> and seven<S>7651</S> thousand<S>505</S> sheep<S>6629</S>. <sup>the same: Heb. in that day</sup>
And they entered<S>935</S> into a covenant<S>1285</S> to seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of their fathers<S>1</S> with all their heart<S>3824</S> and with all their soul<S>5315</S>;
That whosoever would not seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> should be put to death<S>4191</S>, whether<S>4480</S> small<S>6996</S> or great<S>1419</S>, whether man<S>376</S> or woman<S>802</S>.
And they sware<S>7650</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>, and with shouting<S>8643</S>, and with trumpets<S>2689</S>, and with cornets<S>7782</S>.
And all Judah<S>3063</S> rejoiced<S>8055</S> at the oath<S>7621</S>: for they had sworn<S>7650</S> with all their heart<S>3824</S>, and sought<S>1245</S> him with their whole desire<S>7522</S>; and he was found<S>4672</S> of them: and the LORD<S>3068</S> gave them rest<S>5117</S> round about<S>5439</S>.
And also concerning Maachah<S>4601</S> the mother<S>517</S> of Asa<S>609</S> the king<S>4428</S>, he removed<S>5493</S> her from being queen<S>1377</S>, because she had made<S>6213</S> an idol<S>4656</S> in a grove<S>842</S>: and Asa<S>609</S> cut down<S>3772</S> her idol<S>4656</S>, and stamped<S>1854</S> it, and burnt<S>8313</S> it at the brook<S>5158</S> Kidron<S>6939</S>. <sup>mother: that is, grandmother</sup> <sup>idol: Heb. horror</sup>
But the high places<S>1116</S> were not taken away<S>5493</S> out of Israel<S>3478</S>: nevertheless the heart<S>3824</S> of Asa<S>609</S> was perfect<S>8003</S> all his days<S>3117</S>.
And he brought<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> the things that his father<S>1</S> had dedicated<S>6944</S>, and that he himself had dedicated<S>6944</S>, silver<S>3701</S>, and gold<S>2091</S>, and vessels<S>3627</S>.
And there was no more war<S>4421</S> unto the five<S>2568</S> and thirtieth<S>7970</S> year<S>8141</S> of the reign<S>4438</S> of Asa<S>609</S>.

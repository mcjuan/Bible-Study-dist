And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, See<S>7200</S>, I have made<S>5414</S> thee a god<S>430</S> to Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> thy brother<S>251</S> shall be thy prophet<S>5030</S>.
Thou shalt speak<S>1696</S> all that I command<S>6680</S> thee: and Aaron<S>175</S> thy brother<S>251</S> shall speak<S>1696</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, that he send<S>7971</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> out of his land<S>776</S>.
And I will harden<S>7185</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S> my signs<S>226</S> and my wonders<S>4159</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
But Pharaoh<S>6547</S> shall not hearken<S>8085</S> unto you, that I may lay<S>5414</S> my hand<S>3027</S> upon Egypt<S>4714</S>, and bring forth<S>3318</S> mine armies<S>6635</S>, and my people<S>5971</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> by great<S>1419</S> judgments<S>8201</S>.
And the Egyptians<S>4714</S> shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>, when I stretch forth<S>5186</S> mine hand<S>3027</S> upon Egypt<S>4714</S>, and bring out<S>3318</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> from among<S>8432</S> them.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> did<S>6213</S> as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> them, so did<S>6213</S> they.
And Moses<S>4872</S> was fourscore<S>8084</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, and Aaron<S>175</S> fourscore<S>8084</S> and three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, when they spake<S>1696</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and unto Aaron<S>175</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
When Pharaoh<S>6547</S> shall speak<S>1696</S> unto you, saying<S>559</S>, Shew<S>5414</S> a miracle<S>4159</S> for you: then thou shalt say<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Take<S>3947</S> thy rod<S>4294</S>, and cast<S>7993</S> it before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and it shall become a serpent<S>8577</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> went in<S>935</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and they did<S>6213</S> so as the LORD<S>3068</S> had commanded<S>6680</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> cast down<S>7993</S> his rod<S>4294</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and before<S>6440</S> his servants<S>5650</S>, and it became a serpent<S>8577</S>.
Then Pharaoh<S>6547</S> also called<S>7121</S> the wise men<S>2450</S> and the sorcerers<S>3784</S>: now the magicians<S>2748</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, they also did<S>6213</S> in like manner<S>3651</S> with their enchantments<S>3858</S>.
For they cast down<S>7993</S> every man<S>376</S> his rod<S>4294</S>, and they became serpents<S>8577</S>: but Aaron's<S>175</S> rod<S>4294</S> swallowed up<S>1104</S> their rods<S>4294</S>.
And he hardened<S>2388</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S>, that he hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had said<S>1696</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S> is hardened<S>3515</S>, he refuseth<S>3985</S> to let the people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>.
Get<S>3212</S> thee unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>; lo, he goeth out<S>3318</S> unto the water<S>4325</S>; and thou shalt stand<S>5324</S> by the river's<S>2975</S> brink<S>8193</S> against he come<S>7125</S>; and the rod<S>4294</S> which was turned<S>2015</S> to a serpent<S>5175</S> shalt thou take<S>3947</S> in thine hand<S>3027</S>.
And thou shalt say<S>559</S> unto him, The LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> me unto thee, saying<S>559</S>, Let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me in the wilderness<S>4057</S>: and, behold, hitherto<S>3541</S> thou wouldest not hear<S>8085</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, In this thou shalt know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>: behold, I will smite<S>5221</S> with the rod<S>4294</S> that is in mine hand<S>3027</S> upon the waters<S>4325</S> which are in the river<S>2975</S>, and they shall be turned<S>2015</S> to blood<S>1818</S>.
And the fish<S>1710</S> that is in the river<S>2975</S> shall die<S>4191</S>, and the river<S>2975</S> shall stink<S>887</S>; and the Egyptians<S>4714</S> shall lothe<S>3811</S> to drink<S>8354</S> of the water<S>4325</S> of the river<S>2975</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Say<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Take<S>3947</S> thy rod<S>4294</S>, and stretch out<S>5186</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> upon the waters<S>4325</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, upon their streams<S>5104</S>, upon their rivers<S>2975</S>, and upon their ponds<S>98</S>, and upon all their pools<S>4723</S> of water<S>4325</S>, that they may become blood<S>1818</S>; and that there may be blood<S>1818</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, both in vessels of wood<S>6086</S>, and in vessels of stone<S>68</S>. <sup>pools: Heb. gathering of their waters</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> did<S>6213</S> so, as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>; and he lifted up<S>7311</S> the rod<S>4294</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> the waters<S>4325</S> that were in the river<S>2975</S>, in the sight<S>5869</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and in the sight<S>5869</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>; and all the waters<S>4325</S> that were in the river<S>2975</S> were turned<S>2015</S> to blood<S>1818</S>.
And the fish<S>1710</S> that was in the river<S>2975</S> died<S>4191</S>; and the river<S>2975</S> stank<S>887</S>, and the Egyptians<S>4714</S> could<S>3201</S> not drink<S>8354</S> of the water<S>4325</S> of the river<S>2975</S>; and there was blood<S>1818</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And the magicians<S>2748</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> did<S>6213</S> so with their enchantments<S>3909</S>: and Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S> was hardened<S>2388</S>, neither did he hearken<S>8085</S> unto them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had said<S>1696</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> turned<S>6437</S> and went<S>935</S> into his house<S>1004</S>, neither did he set<S>7896</S> his heart<S>3820</S> to this<S>2063</S> also.
And all the Egyptians<S>4714</S> digged<S>2658</S> round about<S>5439</S> the river<S>2975</S> for water<S>4325</S> to drink<S>8354</S>; for they could<S>3201</S> not drink<S>8354</S> of the water<S>4325</S> of the river<S>2975</S>.
And seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> were fulfilled<S>4390</S>, after<S>310</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> had smitten<S>5221</S> the river<S>2975</S>.

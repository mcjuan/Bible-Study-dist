The word<S>1697</S> which came unto Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, when king<S>4428</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S> sent<S>7971</S> unto him Pashur<S>6583</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Melchiah<S>4441</S>, and Zephaniah<S>6846</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Maaseiah<S>4641</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Enquire<S>1875</S>, I pray thee, of the LORD<S>3068</S> for us<S>1157</S>; for Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> maketh war<S>3898</S> against us; if so be that the LORD<S>3068</S> will deal<S>6213</S> with us according to all his wondrous works<S>6381</S>, that he may go up<S>5927</S> from us.
Then said<S>559</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S> unto them, Thus shall ye say<S>559</S> to Zedekiah<S>6667</S>:
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Behold, I will turn back<S>5437</S> the weapons<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S> that are in your hands<S>3027</S>, wherewith ye fight<S>3898</S> against the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and against the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>, which besiege<S>6696</S> you without<S>2351</S> the walls<S>2346</S>, and I will assemble<S>622</S> them into the midst<S>8432</S> of this city<S>5892</S>.
And I myself will fight<S>3898</S> against you with an outstretched<S>5186</S> hand<S>3027</S> and with a strong<S>2389</S> arm<S>2220</S>, even in anger<S>639</S>, and in fury<S>2534</S>, and in great<S>1419</S> wrath<S>7110</S>.
And I will smite<S>5221</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of this city<S>5892</S>, both man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S>: they shall die<S>4191</S> of a great<S>1419</S> pestilence<S>1698</S>.
And afterward<S>310</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, I will deliver<S>5414</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and his servants<S>5650</S>, and the people<S>5971</S>, and such as are left<S>7604</S> in this city<S>5892</S> from the pestilence<S>1698</S>, from the sword<S>2719</S>, and from the famine<S>7458</S>, into the hand<S>3027</S> of Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>341</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of those that seek<S>1245</S> their life<S>5315</S>: and he shall smite<S>5221</S> them with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>; he shall not spare<S>2347</S> them, neither have pity<S>2550</S>, nor have mercy<S>7355</S>.
And unto this people<S>5971</S> thou shalt say<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Behold, I set<S>5414</S> before<S>6440</S> you the way<S>1870</S> of life<S>2416</S>, and the way<S>1870</S> of death<S>4194</S>.
He that abideth<S>3427</S> in this city<S>5892</S> shall die<S>4191</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>, and by the famine<S>7458</S>, and by the pestilence<S>1698</S>: but he that goeth out<S>3318</S>, and falleth<S>5307</S> to the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> that besiege<S>6696</S> you, he shall live<S>2421</S> <S>2421</S>, and his life<S>5315</S> shall be unto him for a prey<S>7998</S>.
For I have set<S>7760</S> my face<S>6440</S> against this city<S>5892</S> for evil<S>7451</S>, and not for good<S>2896</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: it shall be given<S>5414</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and he shall burn<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>.
And touching the house<S>1004</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, say, Hear<S>8085</S> ye the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>;
O house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S>, thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Execute<S>1777</S> judgment<S>4941</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and deliver<S>5337</S> him that is spoiled<S>1497</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the oppressor<S>6231</S>, lest my fury<S>2534</S> go out<S>3318</S> like fire<S>784</S>, and burn<S>1197</S> that none can quench<S>3518</S> it, because<S>6440</S> of the evil<S>7455</S> of your doings<S>4611</S>. <sup>Execute: Heb. Judge</sup>
Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant<S>3427</S> of the valley<S>6010</S>, and rock<S>6697</S> of the plain<S>4334</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; which say<S>559</S>, Who shall come down<S>5181</S> against us? or who shall enter<S>935</S> into our habitations<S>4585</S>? <sup>inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress</sup>
But I will punish<S>6485</S> you according to the fruit<S>6529</S> of your doings<S>4611</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and I will kindle<S>3341</S> a fire<S>784</S> in the forest<S>3293</S> thereof, and it shall devour<S>398</S> all things round about<S>5439</S> it. <sup>punish: Heb. visit upon</sup>

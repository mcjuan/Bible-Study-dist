To the chief Musician<S>5329</S>, A Psalm<S>4210</S> of David<S>1732</S>. Hear<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>, O God<S>430</S>, in my prayer<S>7879</S>: preserve<S>5341</S> my life<S>2416</S> from fear<S>6343</S> of the enemy<S>341</S>.
Hide<S>5641</S> me from the secret counsel<S>5475</S> of the wicked<S>7489</S>; from the insurrection<S>7285</S> of the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S>:
Who whet<S>8150</S> their tongue<S>3956</S> like a sword<S>2719</S>, and bend<S>1869</S> their bows to shoot their arrows<S>2671</S>, even bitter<S>4751</S> words<S>1697</S>:
That they may shoot<S>3384</S> in secret<S>4565</S> at the perfect<S>8535</S>: suddenly<S>6597</S> do they shoot<S>3384</S> at him, and fear<S>3372</S> not.
They encourage<S>2388</S> themselves in an evil<S>7451</S> matter<S>1697</S>: they commune<S>5608</S> of laying<S>2934</S> snares<S>4170</S> privily<S>2934</S>; they say<S>559</S>, Who shall see<S>7200</S> them? <sup>matter: or, speech</sup> <sup>of: Heb. to hide his snares</sup>
They search out<S>2664</S> iniquities<S>5766</S>; they accomplish<S>8552</S> a diligent<S>2664</S> search<S>2665</S>: both the inward<S>7130</S> thought of every one<S>376</S> of them, and the heart<S>3820</S>, is deep<S>6013</S>. <sup>they: or, we are consumed by that which they have throughly searched</sup> <sup>a diligent: Heb. a search searched</sup>
But God<S>430</S> shall shoot<S>3384</S> at them with an arrow<S>2671</S>; suddenly<S>6597</S> shall they be wounded<S>4347</S>. <sup>shall they: Heb. their wound shall be</sup>
So they shall make their own tongue<S>3956</S> to fall<S>3782</S> upon themselves: all that see<S>7200</S> them shall flee away<S>5074</S>.
And all men<S>120</S> shall fear<S>3372</S>, and shall declare<S>5046</S> the work<S>6467</S> of God<S>430</S>; for they shall wisely consider<S>7919</S> of his doing<S>4639</S>.
The righteous<S>6662</S> shall be glad<S>8055</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S>, and shall trust<S>2620</S> in him; and all the upright<S>3477</S> in heart<S>3820</S> shall glory<S>1984</S>.

And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Take<S>3947</S> Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> with him, and the garments<S>899</S>, and the anointing<S>4888</S> oil<S>8081</S>, and a bullock<S>6499</S> for the sin offering<S>2403</S>, and two<S>8147</S> rams<S>352</S>, and a basket<S>5536</S> of unleavened bread<S>4682</S>;
And gather<S>6950</S> thou all the congregation<S>5712</S> together<S>6950</S> unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> did<S>6213</S> as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> him; and the assembly<S>5712</S> was gathered together<S>6950</S> unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto the congregation<S>5712</S>, This is the thing<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> to be done<S>6213</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> brought<S>7126</S> Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S>, and washed<S>7364</S> them with water<S>4325</S>.
And he put<S>5414</S> upon him the coat<S>3801</S>, and girded<S>2296</S> him with the girdle<S>73</S>, and clothed<S>3847</S> him with the robe<S>4598</S>, and put<S>5414</S> the ephod<S>646</S> upon him, and he girded<S>2296</S> him with the curious girdle<S>2805</S> of the ephod<S>646</S>, and bound<S>640</S> it unto him therewith.
And he put<S>7760</S> the breastplate<S>2833</S> upon him: also he put<S>5414</S> in the breastplate<S>2833</S> the Urim<S>224</S> and the Thummim<S>8550</S>.
And he put<S>7760</S> the mitre<S>4701</S> upon his head<S>7218</S>; also upon the mitre<S>4701</S>, even upon his forefront<S>6440</S> <S>4136</S>, did he put<S>7760</S> the golden<S>2091</S> plate<S>6731</S>, the holy<S>6944</S> crown<S>5145</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> the anointing<S>4888</S> oil<S>8081</S>, and anointed<S>4886</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S> and all that was therein, and sanctified<S>6942</S> them.
And he sprinkled<S>5137</S> thereof upon the altar<S>4196</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>, and anointed<S>4886</S> the altar<S>4196</S> and all his vessels<S>3627</S>, both the laver<S>3595</S> and his foot<S>3653</S>, to sanctify<S>6942</S> them.
And he poured<S>3332</S> of the anointing<S>4888</S> oil<S>8081</S> upon Aaron's<S>175</S> head<S>7218</S>, and anointed<S>4886</S> him, to sanctify<S>6942</S> him.
And Moses<S>4872</S> brought<S>7126</S> Aaron's<S>175</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and put<S>3847</S> coats<S>3801</S> upon them, and girded<S>2296</S> them with girdles<S>73</S>, and put<S>2280</S> bonnets<S>4021</S> upon them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>. <sup>put bonnets: Heb. bound bonnets</sup>
And he brought<S>5066</S> the bullock<S>6499</S> for the sin offering<S>2403</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> laid<S>5564</S> their hands<S>3027</S> upon the head<S>7218</S> of the bullock<S>6499</S> for the sin offering<S>2403</S>.
And he slew<S>7819</S> it; and Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> the blood<S>1818</S>, and put<S>5414</S> it upon the horns<S>7161</S> of the altar<S>4196</S> round about<S>5439</S> with his finger<S>676</S>, and purified<S>2398</S> the altar<S>4196</S>, and poured<S>3332</S> the blood<S>1818</S> at the bottom<S>3247</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>, and sanctified<S>6942</S> it, to make reconciliation<S>3722</S> upon it.
And he took<S>3947</S> all the fat<S>2459</S> that was upon the inwards<S>7130</S>, and the caul<S>3508</S> above the liver<S>3516</S>, and the two<S>8147</S> kidneys<S>3629</S>, and their fat<S>2459</S>, and Moses<S>4872</S> burned<S>6999</S> it upon the altar<S>4196</S>.
But the bullock<S>6499</S>, and his hide<S>5785</S>, his flesh<S>1320</S>, and his dung<S>6569</S>, he burnt<S>8313</S> with fire<S>784</S> without<S>2351</S> the camp<S>4264</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And he brought<S>7126</S> the ram<S>352</S> for the burnt offering<S>5930</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> laid<S>5564</S> their hands<S>3027</S> upon the head<S>7218</S> of the ram<S>352</S>.
And he killed<S>7819</S> it; and Moses<S>4872</S> sprinkled<S>2236</S> the blood<S>1818</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S> round about<S>5439</S>.
And he cut<S>5408</S> the ram<S>352</S> into pieces<S>5409</S>; and Moses<S>4872</S> burnt<S>6999</S> the head<S>7218</S>, and the pieces<S>5409</S>, and the fat<S>6309</S>.
And he washed<S>7364</S> the inwards<S>7130</S> and the legs<S>3767</S> in water<S>4325</S>; and Moses<S>4872</S> burnt<S>6999</S> the whole ram<S>352</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>: it was a burnt sacrifice<S>5930</S> for a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S>, and an offering made by fire<S>801</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And he brought<S>7126</S> the other<S>8145</S> ram<S>352</S>, the ram<S>352</S> of consecration<S>4394</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> laid<S>5564</S> their hands<S>3027</S> upon the head<S>7218</S> of the ram<S>352</S>.
And he slew<S>7819</S> it; and Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> of the blood<S>1818</S> of it, and put<S>5414</S> it upon the tip<S>8571</S> of Aaron's<S>175</S> right<S>3233</S> ear<S>241</S>, and upon the thumb<S>931</S> of his right<S>3233</S> hand<S>3027</S>, and upon the great toe<S>931</S> of his right<S>3233</S> foot<S>7272</S>.
And he brought<S>7126</S> Aaron's<S>175</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and Moses<S>4872</S> put<S>5414</S> of the blood<S>1818</S> upon the tip<S>8571</S> of their right<S>3233</S> ear<S>241</S>, and upon the thumbs<S>931</S> of their right<S>3233</S> hands<S>3027</S>, and upon the great toes<S>931</S> of their right<S>3233</S> feet<S>7272</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> sprinkled<S>2236</S> the blood<S>1818</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S> round about<S>5439</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> the fat<S>2459</S>, and the rump<S>451</S>, and all the fat<S>2459</S> that was upon the inwards<S>7130</S>, and the caul<S>3508</S> above the liver<S>3516</S>, and the two<S>8147</S> kidneys<S>3629</S>, and their fat<S>2459</S>, and the right<S>3225</S> shoulder<S>7785</S>:
And out of the basket<S>5536</S> of unleavened<S>4682</S> bread<S>3899</S>, that was before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, he took<S>3947</S> one<S>259</S> unleavened<S>4682</S> cake<S>2471</S>, and a cake<S>2471</S> of oiled<S>8081</S> bread, and one<S>259</S> wafer<S>7550</S>, and put<S>7760</S> them on the fat<S>2459</S>, and upon the right<S>3225</S> shoulder<S>7785</S>:
And he put<S>5414</S> all upon Aaron's<S>175</S> hands<S>3709</S>, and upon his sons'<S>1121</S> hands<S>3709</S>, and waved<S>5130</S> them for a wave offering<S>8573</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> them from off their hands<S>3709</S>, and burnt<S>6999</S> them on the altar<S>4196</S> upon the burnt offering<S>5930</S>: they were consecrations<S>4394</S> for a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S>: it is an offering made by fire<S>801</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> the breast<S>2373</S>, and waved<S>5130</S> it for a wave offering<S>8573</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: for of the ram<S>352</S> of consecration<S>4394</S> it was Moses'<S>4872</S> part<S>4490</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> of the anointing<S>4888</S> oil<S>8081</S>, and of the blood<S>1818</S> which was upon the altar<S>4196</S>, and sprinkled<S>5137</S> it upon Aaron<S>175</S>, and upon his garments<S>899</S>, and upon his sons<S>1121</S>, and upon his sons'<S>1121</S> garments<S>899</S> with him; and sanctified<S>6942</S> Aaron<S>175</S>, and his garments<S>899</S>, and his sons<S>1121</S>, and his sons'<S>1121</S> garments<S>899</S> with him.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S> and to his sons<S>1121</S>, Boil<S>1310</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>: and there eat<S>398</S> it with the bread<S>3899</S> that is in the basket<S>5536</S> of consecrations<S>4394</S>, as I commanded<S>6680</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> shall eat<S>398</S> it.
And that which remaineth<S>3498</S> of the flesh<S>1320</S> and of the bread<S>3899</S> shall ye burn<S>8313</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
And ye shall not go out<S>3318</S> of the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S> in seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, until the days<S>3117</S> of your consecration<S>4394</S> be at an end<S>4390</S>: for seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> shall he consecrate<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> you.
As he hath done<S>6213</S> this day<S>3117</S>, so the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> to do<S>6213</S>, to make an atonement<S>3722</S> for you.
Therefore shall ye abide<S>3427</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S> day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, and keep<S>8104</S> the charge<S>4931</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that ye die<S>4191</S> not: for so I am commanded<S>6680</S>.
So Aaron<S>175</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> did<S>6213</S> all things<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>.

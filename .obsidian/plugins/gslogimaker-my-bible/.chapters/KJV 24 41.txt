Now it came to pass in the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S>, that Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Elishama<S>476</S>, of the seed<S>2233</S> royal<S>4410</S>, and the princes<S>7227</S> of the king<S>4428</S>, even ten<S>6235</S> men<S>582</S> with him, came<S>935</S> unto Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> to Mizpah<S>4709</S>; and there they did eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> together<S>3162</S> in Mizpah<S>4708</S>.
Then arose<S>6965</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and the ten<S>6235</S> men<S>582</S> that were with him, and smote<S>5221</S> Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> him, whom the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had made governor<S>6485</S> over the land<S>776</S>.
Ishmael<S>3458</S> also slew<S>5221</S> all the Jews<S>3064</S> that were with him, even with Gedaliah<S>1436</S>, at Mizpah<S>4709</S>, and the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> that were found<S>4672</S> there, and the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>.
And it came to pass the second<S>8145</S> day<S>3117</S> after he had slain<S>4191</S> Gedaliah<S>1436</S>, and no man<S>376</S> knew<S>3045</S> it,
That there came<S>935</S> certain<S>582</S> from Shechem<S>7927</S>, from Shiloh<S>7887</S>, and from Samaria<S>8111</S>, even fourscore<S>8084</S> men<S>376</S>, having their beards<S>2206</S> shaven<S>1548</S>, and their clothes<S>899</S> rent<S>7167</S>, and having cut<S>1413</S> themselves, with offerings<S>4503</S> and incense<S>3828</S> in their hand<S>3027</S>, to bring<S>935</S> them to the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> went forth<S>3318</S> from Mizpah<S>4709</S> to meet<S>7125</S> them, weeping<S>1058</S> all along<S>1980</S> as he went<S>1980</S>: and it came to pass, as he met<S>6298</S> them, he said<S>559</S> unto them, Come<S>935</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S>. <sup>weeping: Heb. in going and weeping</sup>
And it was so, when they came<S>935</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, that Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> slew<S>7819</S> them, and cast them into the midst<S>8432</S> of the pit<S>953</S>, he, and the men<S>582</S> that were with him.
But ten<S>6235</S> men<S>582</S> were found<S>4672</S> among them that said<S>559</S> unto Ishmael<S>3458</S>, Slay<S>4191</S> us not: for we have<S>3426</S> treasures<S>4301</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, of wheat<S>2406</S>, and of barley<S>8184</S>, and of oil<S>8081</S>, and of honey<S>1706</S>. So he forbare<S>2308</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> them not among<S>8432</S> their brethren<S>251</S>.
Now the pit<S>953</S> wherein Ishmael<S>3458</S> had cast<S>7993</S> all the dead bodies<S>6297</S> of the men<S>582</S>, whom he had slain<S>5221</S> because<S>3027</S> of Gedaliah<S>1436</S>, was it which Asa<S>609</S> the king<S>4428</S> had made<S>6213</S> for fear<S>6440</S> of Baasha<S>1201</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> filled<S>4390</S> it with them that were slain<S>2491</S>. <sup>because: or, near Gedaliah: Heb. by the hand, or, by the side of Gedaliah</sup>
Then Ishmael<S>3458</S> carried away captive<S>7617</S> all the residue<S>7611</S> of the people<S>5971</S> that were in Mizpah<S>4709</S>, even the king's<S>4428</S> daughters<S>1323</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> that remained<S>7604</S> in Mizpah<S>4709</S>, whom Nebuzaradan<S>5018</S> the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> had committed<S>6485</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S>: and Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> carried them away captive<S>7617</S>, and departed<S>3212</S> to go over<S>5674</S> to the Ammonites<S>1121</S> <S>5983</S>.
But when Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, and all the captains<S>8269</S> of the forces<S>2428</S> that were with him, heard<S>8085</S> of all the evil<S>7451</S> that Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> had done<S>6213</S>,
Then they took<S>3947</S> all the men<S>582</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to fight<S>3898</S> with Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and found<S>4672</S> him by the great<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S> that are in Gibeon<S>1391</S>.
Now it came to pass, that when all the people<S>5971</S> which were with Ishmael<S>3458</S> saw<S>7200</S> Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, and all the captains<S>8269</S> of the forces<S>2428</S> that were with him, then they were glad<S>8055</S>.
So all the people<S>5971</S> that Ishmael<S>3458</S> had carried away captive<S>7617</S> from Mizpah<S>4709</S> cast about<S>5437</S> and returned<S>7725</S>, and went<S>3212</S> unto Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>.
But Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> escaped<S>4422</S> from<S>6440</S> Johanan<S>3110</S> with eight<S>8083</S> men<S>582</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to the Ammonites<S>1121</S> <S>5983</S>.
Then took<S>3947</S> Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, and all the captains<S>8269</S> of the forces<S>2428</S> that were with him, all the remnant<S>7611</S> of the people<S>5971</S> whom he had recovered<S>7725</S> from Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, from Mizpah<S>4709</S>, after<S>310</S> that he had slain<S>5221</S> Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S>, even mighty<S>1397</S> men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and the women<S>802</S>, and the children<S>2945</S>, and the eunuchs<S>5631</S>, whom he had brought again<S>7725</S> from Gibeon<S>1391</S>:
And they departed<S>3212</S>, and dwelt in<S>3427</S> the habitation<S>1628</S> of Chimham<S>3643</S>, which is by<S>681</S> Bethlehem<S>1035</S>, to go<S>3212</S> to enter<S>935</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>,
Because<S>6440</S> of the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>: for they were afraid<S>3372</S> of them, because Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> had slain<S>5221</S> Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S>, whom the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> made governor<S>6485</S> in the land<S>776</S>.

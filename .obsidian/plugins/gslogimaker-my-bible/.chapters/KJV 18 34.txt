Furthermore Elihu<S>453</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>,
Hear<S>8085</S> my words<S>4405</S>, O ye wise<S>2450</S> men; and give ear<S>238</S> unto me, ye that have knowledge<S>3045</S>.
For the ear<S>241</S> trieth<S>974</S> words<S>4405</S>, as the mouth<S>2441</S> tasteth<S>2938</S> meat<S>398</S>. <sup>mouth: Heb. palate</sup>
Let us choose<S>977</S> to us judgment<S>4941</S>: let us know<S>3045</S> among ourselves what is good<S>2896</S>.
For Job<S>347</S> hath said<S>559</S>, I am righteous<S>6663</S>: and God<S>410</S> hath taken away<S>5493</S> my judgment<S>4941</S>.
Should I lie<S>3576</S> against my right<S>4941</S>? my wound<S>2671</S> is incurable<S>605</S> without transgression<S>6588</S>. <sup>my wound: Heb. mine arrow</sup>
What man<S>1397</S> is like Job<S>347</S>, who drinketh up<S>8354</S> scorning<S>3933</S> like water<S>4325</S>?
Which goeth<S>732</S> in company<S>2274</S> with the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S>, and walketh<S>3212</S> with wicked<S>7562</S> men<S>582</S>.
For he hath said<S>559</S>, It profiteth<S>5532</S> a man<S>1397</S> nothing that he should delight<S>7521</S> himself with God<S>430</S>.
Therefore hearken<S>8085</S> unto me, ye men<S>582</S> of understanding<S>3824</S>: far be it<S>2486</S> from God<S>410</S>, that he should do wickedness<S>7562</S>; and from the Almighty<S>7706</S>, that he should commit iniquity<S>5766</S>. <sup>men: Heb. men of heart</sup>
For the work<S>6467</S> of a man<S>120</S> shall he render<S>7999</S> unto him, and cause every man<S>376</S> to find<S>4672</S> according to his ways<S>734</S>.
Yea, surely<S>551</S> God<S>410</S> will not do wickedly<S>7561</S>, neither will the Almighty<S>7706</S> pervert<S>5791</S> judgment<S>4941</S>.
Who hath given him a charge<S>6485</S> over the earth<S>776</S>? or who hath disposed<S>7760</S> the whole world<S>8398</S>? <sup>the whole: Heb. all of it?</sup>
If he set<S>7760</S> his heart<S>3820</S> upon man, if he gather<S>622</S> unto himself his spirit<S>7307</S> and his breath<S>5397</S>; <sup>man: Heb. him</sup>
All flesh<S>1320</S> shall perish<S>1478</S> together<S>3162</S>, and man<S>120</S> shall turn again<S>7725</S> unto dust<S>6083</S>.
If now thou hast understanding<S>998</S>, hear<S>8085</S> this: hearken<S>238</S> to the voice<S>6963</S> of my words<S>4405</S>.
Shall even he that hateth<S>8130</S> right<S>4941</S> govern<S>2280</S>? and wilt thou condemn<S>7561</S> him that is most<S>3524</S> just<S>6662</S>? <sup>govern: Heb. bind?</sup>
Is it fit to say<S>559</S> to a king<S>4428</S>, Thou art wicked<S>1100</S>? and to princes<S>5081</S>, Ye are ungodly<S>7563</S>?
How much less to him that accepteth<S>5375</S> not the persons<S>6440</S> of princes<S>8269</S>, nor regardeth<S>5234</S> the rich<S>7771</S> more than<S>6440</S> the poor<S>1800</S>? for they all are the work<S>4639</S> of his hands<S>3027</S>.
In a moment<S>7281</S> shall they die<S>4191</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> shall be troubled<S>1607</S> at midnight<S>2676</S> <S>3915</S>, and pass away<S>5674</S>: and the mighty<S>47</S> shall be taken away<S>5493</S> without hand<S>3027</S>. <sup>the mighty: Heb. they shall take away the mighty</sup>
For his eyes<S>5869</S> are upon the ways<S>1870</S> of man<S>376</S>, and he seeth<S>7200</S> all his goings<S>6806</S>.
There is no darkness<S>2822</S>, nor shadow of death<S>6757</S>, where the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S> may hide<S>5641</S> themselves.
For he will not lay<S>7760</S> upon man<S>376</S> more than right; that he should enter<S>1980</S> into judgment<S>4941</S> with God<S>410</S>. <sup>enter: Heb. go</sup>
He shall break in pieces<S>7489</S> mighty men<S>3524</S> without number<S>2714</S>, and set<S>5975</S> others<S>312</S> in their stead. <sup>number: Heb. searching out</sup>
Therefore he knoweth<S>5234</S> their works<S>4566</S>, and he overturneth<S>2015</S> them in the night<S>3915</S>, so that they are destroyed<S>1792</S>. <sup>destroyed: Heb. crushed</sup>
He striketh<S>5606</S> them as<S>8478</S> wicked men<S>7563</S> in the open<S>4725</S> sight<S>7200</S> of others; <sup>open: Heb. place of beholders</sup>
Because they turned back<S>5493</S> from him<S>310</S>, and would not consider<S>7919</S> any of his ways<S>1870</S>: <sup>him: Heb. after him</sup>
So that they cause the cry<S>6818</S> of the poor<S>1800</S> to come<S>935</S> unto him, and he heareth<S>8085</S> the cry<S>6818</S> of the afflicted<S>6041</S>.
When he giveth quietness<S>8252</S>, who then can make trouble<S>7561</S>? and when he hideth<S>5641</S> his face<S>6440</S>, who then can behold<S>7789</S> him? whether it be done against a nation<S>1471</S>, or against a man<S>120</S> only<S>3162</S>:
That the hypocrite<S>120</S> <S>2611</S> reign<S>4427</S> not, lest the people<S>5971</S> be ensnared<S>4170</S>.
Surely it is meet to be said<S>559</S> unto God<S>410</S>, I have borne<S>5375</S> chastisement, I will not offend<S>2254</S> any more:
That which I see<S>2372</S> not<S>1107</S> teach<S>3384</S> thou me: if I have done<S>6466</S> iniquity<S>5766</S>, I will do<S>3254</S> no more.
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense<S>7999</S> it, whether thou refuse<S>3588</S> <S>3988</S>, or whether thou choose<S>977</S>; and not I: therefore speak<S>1696</S> what thou knowest<S>3045</S>. <sup>according: Heb. from with thee?</sup>
Let men<S>582</S> of understanding<S>3824</S> tell<S>559</S> me, and let a wise<S>2450</S> man<S>1397</S> hearken<S>8085</S> unto me. <sup>of: Heb. of heart</sup>
Job<S>347</S> hath spoken<S>1696</S> without knowledge<S>1847</S>, and his words<S>1697</S> were without wisdom<S>7919</S>.
My desire<S>15</S> <S>1</S> is that Job<S>347</S> may be tried<S>974</S> unto the end<S>5331</S> because of his answers<S>8666</S> for wicked<S>205</S> men<S>582</S>. <sup>My: or, My father, let Job be tried</sup>
For he addeth<S>3254</S> rebellion<S>6588</S> unto his sin<S>2403</S>, he clappeth<S>5606</S> his hands among us, and multiplieth<S>7235</S> his words<S>561</S> against God<S>410</S>.

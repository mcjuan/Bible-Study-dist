And it shall be, when thou art come in<S>935</S> unto the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee for an inheritance<S>5159</S>, and possessest<S>3423</S> it, and dwellest<S>3427</S> therein;
That thou shalt take<S>3947</S> of the first<S>7225</S> of all the fruit<S>6529</S> of the earth<S>127</S>, which thou shalt bring<S>935</S> of thy land<S>776</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee, and shalt put<S>7760</S> it in a basket<S>2935</S>, and shalt go<S>1980</S> unto the place<S>4725</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> shall choose<S>977</S> to place<S>7931</S> his name<S>8034</S> there.
And thou shalt go<S>935</S> unto the priest<S>3548</S> that shall be in those days<S>3117</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto him, I profess<S>5046</S> this day<S>3117</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, that I am come<S>935</S> unto the country<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto our fathers<S>1</S> for to give<S>5414</S> us.
And the priest<S>3548</S> shall take<S>3947</S> the basket<S>2935</S> out of thine hand<S>3027</S>, and set it down<S>3240</S> before<S>6440</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>.
And thou shalt speak<S>6030</S> and say<S>559</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, A Syrian<S>761</S> ready to perish<S>6</S> was my father<S>1</S>, and he went down<S>3381</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>, and sojourned<S>1481</S> there with<S>4962</S> a few<S>4592</S>, and became there a nation<S>1471</S>, great<S>1419</S>, mighty<S>6099</S>, and populous<S>7227</S>:
And the Egyptians<S>4713</S> evil entreated<S>7489</S> us, and afflicted<S>6031</S> us, and laid<S>5414</S> upon us hard<S>7186</S> bondage<S>5656</S>:
And when we cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of our fathers<S>1</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> heard<S>8085</S> our voice<S>6963</S>, and looked<S>7200</S> on our affliction<S>6040</S>, and our labour<S>5999</S>, and our oppression<S>3906</S>:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> brought us forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S> with a mighty<S>2389</S> hand<S>3027</S>, and with an outstretched<S>5186</S> arm<S>2220</S>, and with great<S>1419</S> terribleness<S>4172</S>, and with signs<S>226</S>, and with wonders<S>4159</S>:
And he hath brought<S>935</S> us into this place<S>4725</S>, and hath given<S>5414</S> us this land<S>776</S>, even a land<S>776</S> that floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>.
And now, behold, I have brought<S>935</S> the firstfruits<S>6529</S> <S>7225</S> of the land<S>127</S>, which thou, O LORD<S>3068</S>, hast given<S>5414</S> me. And thou shalt set<S>3240</S> it before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, and worship<S>7812</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>:
And thou shalt rejoice<S>8055</S> in every good<S>2896</S> thing which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath given<S>5414</S> unto thee, and unto thine house<S>1004</S>, thou, and the Levite<S>3881</S>, and the stranger<S>1616</S> that is among<S>7130</S> you.
When thou hast made an end<S>3615</S> of tithing<S>6237</S> all the tithes<S>4643</S> of thine increase<S>8393</S> the third<S>7992</S> year<S>8141</S>, which is the year<S>8141</S> of tithing<S>4643</S>, and hast given<S>5414</S> it unto the Levite<S>3881</S>, the stranger<S>1616</S>, the fatherless<S>3490</S>, and the widow<S>490</S>, that they may eat<S>398</S> within thy gates<S>8179</S>, and be filled<S>7646</S>;
Then thou shalt say<S>559</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, I have brought away<S>1197</S> the hallowed things<S>6944</S> out of mine house<S>1004</S>, and also have given<S>5414</S> them unto the Levite<S>3881</S>, and unto the stranger<S>1616</S>, to the fatherless<S>3490</S>, and to the widow<S>490</S>, according to all thy commandments<S>4687</S> which thou hast commanded<S>6680</S> me: I have not transgressed<S>5674</S> thy commandments<S>4687</S>, neither have I forgotten<S>7911</S> them:
I have not eaten<S>398</S> thereof in my mourning<S>205</S>, neither have I taken away<S>1197</S> ought thereof for any unclean<S>2931</S> use, nor given<S>5414</S> ought thereof for the dead<S>4191</S>: but I have hearkened<S>8085</S> to the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> my God<S>430</S>, and have done<S>6213</S> according to all that thou hast commanded<S>6680</S> me.
Look down<S>8259</S> from thy holy<S>6944</S> habitation<S>4583</S>, from heaven<S>8064</S>, and bless<S>1288</S> thy people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and the land<S>127</S> which thou hast given<S>5414</S> us, as thou swarest<S>7650</S> unto our fathers<S>1</S>, a land<S>776</S> that floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>.
This day<S>3117</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> thee to do<S>6213</S> these statutes<S>2706</S> and judgments<S>4941</S>: thou shalt therefore keep<S>8104</S> and do<S>6213</S> them with all thine heart<S>3824</S>, and with all thy soul<S>5315</S>.
Thou hast avouched<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> this day<S>3117</S> to be thy God<S>430</S>, and to walk<S>3212</S> in his ways<S>1870</S>, and to keep<S>8104</S> his statutes<S>2706</S>, and his commandments<S>4687</S>, and his judgments<S>4941</S>, and to hearken<S>8085</S> unto his voice<S>6963</S>:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hath avouched<S>559</S> thee this day<S>3117</S> to be his peculiar<S>5459</S> people<S>5971</S>, as he hath promised<S>1696</S> thee, and that thou shouldest keep<S>8104</S> all his commandments<S>4687</S>;
And to make<S>5414</S> thee high<S>5945</S> above all nations<S>1471</S> which he hath made<S>6213</S>, in praise<S>8416</S>, and in name<S>8034</S>, and in honour<S>8597</S>; and that thou mayest be an holy<S>6918</S> people<S>5971</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, as he hath spoken<S>1696</S>.

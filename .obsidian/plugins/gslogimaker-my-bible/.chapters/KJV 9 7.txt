And the men<S>582</S> of Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S> came<S>935</S>, and fetched up<S>5927</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and brought<S>935</S> it into the house<S>1004</S> of Abinadab<S>41</S> in the hill<S>1389</S>, and sanctified<S>6942</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> his son<S>1121</S> to keep<S>8104</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And it came to pass, while<S>3117</S> the ark<S>727</S> abode<S>3427</S> in Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S>, that the time<S>3117</S> was long<S>7235</S>; for it was twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S>: and all the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> lamented<S>5091</S> after<S>310</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Samuel<S>8050</S> spake<S>559</S> unto all the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, If ye do return<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> with all your hearts<S>3824</S>, then put away<S>5493</S> the strange<S>5236</S> gods<S>430</S> and Ashtaroth<S>6252</S> from among<S>8432</S> you, and prepare<S>3559</S> your hearts<S>3824</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> him only: and he will deliver<S>5337</S> you out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>.
Then the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did put away<S>5493</S> Baalim<S>1168</S> and Ashtaroth<S>6252</S>, and served<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> only.
And Samuel<S>8050</S> said<S>559</S>, Gather<S>6908</S> all Israel<S>3478</S> to Mizpeh<S>4708</S>, and I will pray<S>6419</S> for you unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And they gathered together<S>6908</S> to Mizpeh<S>4709</S>, and drew<S>7579</S> water<S>4325</S>, and poured it out<S>8210</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and fasted<S>6684</S> on that day<S>3117</S>, and said<S>559</S> there, We have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>. And Samuel<S>8050</S> judged<S>8199</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in Mizpeh<S>4708</S>.
And when the Philistines<S>6430</S> heard<S>8085</S> that the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were gathered together<S>6908</S> to Mizpeh<S>4708</S>, the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> went up<S>5927</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>. And when the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> heard<S>8085</S> it, they were afraid<S>3372</S> of<S>6440</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> to Samuel<S>8050</S>, Cease<S>2790</S> not to cry<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> for us, that he will save<S>3467</S> us out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>. <sup>Cease: Heb. Be not silent from us from crying</sup>
And Samuel<S>8050</S> took<S>3947</S> a<S>259</S> sucking<S>2461</S> lamb<S>2924</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> it for a burnt offering<S>5930</S> wholly<S>3632</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: and Samuel<S>8050</S> cried<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> for Israel<S>3478</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> heard<S>6030</S> him. <sup>heard: or, answered</sup>
And as Samuel<S>8050</S> was offering up<S>5927</S> the burnt offering<S>5930</S>, the Philistines<S>6430</S> drew near<S>5066</S> to battle<S>4421</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>: but the LORD<S>3068</S> thundered<S>7481</S> with a great<S>1419</S> thunder<S>6963</S> on that day<S>3117</S> upon the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and discomfited<S>2000</S> them; and they were smitten<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went out<S>3318</S> of Mizpeh<S>4709</S>, and pursued<S>7291</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> them, until they came under Bethcar<S>1033</S>.
Then Samuel<S>8050</S> took<S>3947</S> a<S>259</S> stone<S>68</S>, and set<S>7760</S> it between Mizpeh<S>4709</S> and Shen<S>8129</S>, and called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of it Ebenezer<S>72</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Hitherto hath the LORD<S>3068</S> helped<S>5826</S> us. <sup>Ebenezer: that is, The stone of help</sup>
So the Philistines<S>6430</S> were subdued<S>3665</S>, and they came<S>935</S> no more<S>3254</S> into the coast<S>1366</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was against the Philistines<S>6430</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of Samuel<S>8050</S>.
And the cities<S>5892</S> which the Philistines<S>6430</S> had taken<S>3947</S> from Israel<S>3478</S> were restored<S>7725</S> to Israel<S>3478</S>, from Ekron<S>6138</S> even unto Gath<S>1661</S>; and the coasts<S>1366</S> thereof did Israel<S>3478</S> deliver<S>5337</S> out of the hands<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>. And there was peace<S>7965</S> between Israel<S>3478</S> and the Amorites<S>567</S>.
And Samuel<S>8050</S> judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>.
And he went<S>1980</S> from<S>1767</S> year<S>8141</S> to year<S>8141</S> in circuit<S>5437</S> to Bethel<S>1008</S>, and Gilgal<S>1537</S>, and Mizpeh<S>4709</S>, and judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> in all those places<S>4725</S>. <sup>in circuit: Heb. and he circuited</sup>
And his return<S>8666</S> was to Ramah<S>7414</S>; for there was his house<S>1004</S>; and there he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S>; and there he built<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.

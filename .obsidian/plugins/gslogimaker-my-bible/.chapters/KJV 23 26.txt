In that day<S>3117</S> shall this song<S>7892</S> be sung<S>7891</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>; We have a strong<S>5797</S> city<S>5892</S>; salvation<S>3444</S> will God appoint<S>7896</S> for walls<S>2346</S> and bulwarks<S>2426</S>.
Open<S>6605</S> ye the gates<S>8179</S>, that the righteous<S>6662</S> nation<S>1471</S> which keepeth<S>8104</S> the truth<S>529</S> may enter in<S>935</S>. <sup>truth: Heb. truths</sup>
Thou wilt keep<S>5341</S> him in perfect<S>7965</S> peace<S>7965</S>, whose mind<S>3336</S> is stayed<S>5564</S> on thee: because he trusteth<S>982</S> in thee. <sup>perfect: Heb. peace, peace</sup> <sup>mind: or, thought, or, imagination</sup>
Trust<S>982</S> ye in the LORD<S>3068</S> for ever<S>5703</S>: for in the LORD<S>3050</S> JEHOVAH<S>3068</S> is everlasting<S>5769</S> strength<S>6697</S>: <sup>everlasting: Heb. the rock of ages</sup>
For he bringeth down<S>7817</S> them that dwell<S>3427</S> on high<S>4791</S>; the lofty<S>7682</S> city<S>7151</S>, he layeth it low<S>8213</S>; he layeth it low<S>8213</S>, even to the ground<S>776</S>; he bringeth<S>5060</S> it even to the dust<S>6083</S>.
The foot<S>7272</S> shall tread it down<S>7429</S>, even the feet<S>7272</S> of the poor<S>6041</S>, and the steps<S>6471</S> of the needy<S>1800</S>.
The way<S>734</S> of the just<S>6662</S> is uprightness<S>4339</S>: thou, most upright<S>3477</S>, dost weigh<S>6424</S> the path<S>4570</S> of the just<S>6662</S>.
Yea, in the way<S>734</S> of thy judgments<S>4941</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, have we waited<S>6960</S> for thee; the desire<S>8378</S> of our soul<S>5315</S> is to thy name<S>8034</S>, and to the remembrance<S>2143</S> of thee.
With my soul<S>5315</S> have I desired<S>183</S> thee in the night<S>3915</S>; yea, with my spirit<S>7307</S> within<S>7130</S> me will I seek thee early<S>7836</S>: for when thy judgments<S>4941</S> are in the earth<S>776</S>, the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the world<S>8398</S> will learn<S>3925</S> righteousness<S>6664</S>.
Let favour be shewed<S>2603</S> to the wicked<S>7563</S>, yet will he not<S>1077</S> learn<S>3925</S> righteousness<S>6664</S>: in the land<S>776</S> of uprightness<S>5229</S> will he deal unjustly<S>5765</S>, and will not<S>1077</S> behold<S>7200</S> the majesty<S>1348</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
LORD<S>3068</S>, when thy hand<S>3027</S> is lifted up<S>7311</S>, they will not see<S>2372</S>: but they shall see<S>2372</S>, and be ashamed<S>954</S> for their envy<S>7068</S> at the people<S>5971</S>; yea, the fire<S>784</S> of thine enemies<S>6862</S> shall devour<S>398</S> them. <sup>at: or, toward thy people</sup>
LORD<S>3068</S>, thou wilt ordain<S>8239</S> peace<S>7965</S> for us: for thou also hast wrought<S>6466</S> all our works<S>4639</S> in us. <sup>in us: or, for us</sup>
O LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, other lords<S>113</S> beside<S>2108</S> thee have had dominion<S>1166</S> over us: but by thee only will we make mention<S>2142</S> of thy name<S>8034</S>.
They are dead<S>4191</S>, they shall not live<S>2421</S>; they are deceased<S>7496</S>, they shall not rise<S>6965</S>: therefore hast thou visited<S>6485</S> and destroyed<S>8045</S> them, and made all their memory<S>2143</S> to perish<S>6</S>.
Thou hast increased<S>3254</S> the nation<S>1471</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, thou hast increased<S>3254</S> the nation<S>1471</S>: thou art glorified<S>3513</S>: thou hadst removed it far<S>7368</S> unto all the ends<S>7099</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
LORD<S>3068</S>, in trouble<S>6862</S> have they visited<S>6485</S> thee, they poured out<S>6694</S> a prayer<S>3908</S> when thy chastening<S>4148</S> was upon them. <sup>prayer: Heb. secret speech</sup>
Like<S>3644</S> as a woman with child<S>2030</S>, that draweth near<S>7126</S> the time of her delivery<S>3205</S>, is in pain<S>2342</S>, and crieth out<S>2199</S> in her pangs<S>2256</S>; so have we been in thy sight<S>6440</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>.
We have been with child<S>2029</S>, we have been in pain<S>2342</S>, we have as it were<S>3644</S> brought forth<S>3205</S> wind<S>7307</S>; we have not wrought<S>6213</S> any deliverance<S>3444</S> in the earth<S>776</S>; neither<S>1077</S> have the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the world<S>8398</S> fallen<S>5307</S>.
Thy dead<S>4191</S> men shall live<S>2421</S>, together with my dead body<S>5038</S> shall they arise<S>6965</S>. Awake<S>6974</S> and sing<S>7442</S>, ye that dwell<S>7931</S> in dust<S>6083</S>: for thy dew<S>2919</S> is as the dew<S>2919</S> of herbs<S>219</S>, and the earth<S>776</S> shall cast out<S>5307</S> the dead<S>7496</S>.
Come<S>3212</S>, my people<S>5971</S>, enter<S>935</S> thou into thy chambers<S>2315</S>, and shut<S>5462</S> thy doors<S>1817</S> about thee: hide<S>2247</S> thyself as it were for a little<S>4592</S> moment<S>7281</S>, until the indignation<S>2195</S> be overpast<S>5674</S>.
For, behold, the LORD<S>3068</S> cometh out<S>3318</S> of his place<S>4725</S> to punish<S>6485</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the earth<S>776</S> for their iniquity<S>5771</S>: the earth<S>776</S> also shall disclose<S>1540</S> her blood<S>1818</S>, and shall no more cover<S>3680</S> her slain<S>2026</S>. <sup>blood: Heb. bloods</sup>

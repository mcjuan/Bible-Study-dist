Then all the people<S>5971</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> took<S>3947</S> Uzziah<S>5818</S>, who was sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, and made him king<S>4427</S> in the room of his father<S>1</S> Amaziah<S>558</S>. <sup>Uzziah: or, Azariah</sup>
He built<S>1129</S> Eloth<S>359</S>, and restored<S>7725</S> it to Judah<S>3063</S>, after<S>310</S> that the king<S>4428</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>.
Sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> was Uzziah<S>5818</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> fifty<S>2572</S> and two<S>8147</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. His mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> also was Jecoliah<S>3203</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, according to all that his father<S>1</S> Amaziah<S>558</S> did<S>6213</S>.
And he sought<S>1875</S> God<S>430</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of Zechariah<S>2148</S>, who had understanding<S>995</S> in the visions<S>7200</S> of God<S>430</S>: and as long as<S>3117</S> he sought<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, God<S>430</S> made him to prosper<S>6743</S>. <sup>in the visions: Heb. in the seeing of God</sup>
And he went forth<S>3318</S> and warred<S>3898</S> against the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and brake down<S>6555</S> the wall<S>2346</S> of Gath<S>1661</S>, and the wall<S>2346</S> of Jabneh<S>2996</S>, and the wall<S>2346</S> of Ashdod<S>795</S>, and built<S>1129</S> cities<S>5892</S> about Ashdod<S>795</S>, and among the Philistines<S>6430</S>. <sup>about: or, in the country of Ashdod</sup>
And God<S>430</S> helped<S>5826</S> him against the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and against the Arabians<S>6163</S> that dwelt<S>3427</S> in Gurbaal<S>1485</S>, and the Mehunims<S>4586</S>.
And the Ammonites<S>5984</S> gave<S>5414</S> gifts<S>4503</S> to Uzziah<S>5818</S>: and his name<S>8034</S> spread abroad<S>3212</S> even to the entering<S>935</S> in of Egypt<S>4714</S>; for he strengthened<S>2388</S> himself exceedingly<S>4605</S>. <sup>spread: Heb. went</sup>
Moreover Uzziah<S>5818</S> built<S>1129</S> towers<S>4026</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> at the corner<S>6438</S> gate<S>8179</S>, and at the valley<S>1516</S> gate<S>8179</S>, and at the turning<S>4740</S> of the wall, and fortified<S>2388</S> them. <sup>fortified: or, repaired</sup>
Also he built<S>1129</S> towers<S>4026</S> in the desert<S>4057</S>, and digged<S>2672</S> many<S>7227</S> wells<S>953</S>: for he had much<S>7227</S> cattle<S>4735</S>, both in the low country<S>8219</S>, and in the plains<S>4334</S>: husbandmen<S>406</S> also, and vine dressers<S>3755</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S>, and in Carmel<S>3760</S>: for he loved<S>157</S> husbandry<S>127</S>. <sup>digged: or, cut out many cisterns</sup> <sup>Carmel: or, fruitful fields</sup> <sup>husbandry: Heb. ground</sup>
Moreover Uzziah<S>5818</S> had an host<S>2428</S> of fighting<S>4421</S> men<S>6213</S>, that went out<S>3318</S> to war<S>6635</S> by bands<S>1416</S>, according to the number<S>4557</S> of their account<S>6486</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Jeiel<S>3273</S> the scribe<S>5608</S> and Maaseiah<S>4641</S> the ruler<S>7860</S>, under the hand<S>3027</S> of Hananiah<S>2608</S>, one of the king's<S>4428</S> captains<S>8269</S>.
The whole number<S>4557</S> of the chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S> of the mighty men<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S> were two thousand<S>505</S> and six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S>.
And under their hand<S>3027</S> was an army<S>2428</S> <S>6635</S>, three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> and seven<S>7651</S> thousand<S>505</S> and five<S>2568</S> hundred<S>3967</S>, that made<S>6213</S> war<S>4421</S> with mighty<S>2428</S> power<S>3581</S>, to help<S>5826</S> the king<S>4428</S> against the enemy<S>341</S>. <sup>an army: Heb. the power of an army</sup>
And Uzziah<S>5818</S> prepared<S>3559</S> for them throughout all the host<S>6635</S> shields<S>4043</S>, and spears<S>7420</S>, and helmets<S>3553</S>, and habergeons<S>8302</S>, and bows<S>7198</S>, and slings<S>7050</S> to cast stones<S>68</S>. <sup>slings: Heb. stones of slings</sup>
And he made<S>6213</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> engines<S>2810</S>, invented<S>4284</S> by cunning men<S>2803</S>, to be on the towers<S>4026</S> and upon the bulwarks<S>6438</S>, to shoot<S>3384</S> arrows<S>2671</S> and great<S>1419</S> stones<S>68</S> withal. And his name<S>8034</S> spread<S>3318</S> far abroad<S>7350</S>; for he was marvellously<S>6381</S> helped<S>5826</S>, till<S>3588</S> he was strong<S>2388</S>. <sup>spread: Heb. went forth</sup>
But when he was strong<S>2393</S>, his heart<S>3820</S> was lifted up<S>1361</S> to his destruction<S>7843</S>: for he transgressed<S>4603</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, and went<S>935</S> into the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S> of incense<S>7004</S>.
And Azariah<S>5838</S> the priest<S>3548</S> went in<S>935</S> after<S>310</S> him, and with him fourscore<S>8084</S> priests<S>3548</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that were valiant<S>2428</S> men<S>1121</S>:
And they withstood<S>5975</S> Uzziah<S>5818</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah<S>5818</S>, to burn incense<S>6999</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, but to the priests<S>3548</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Aaron<S>175</S>, that are consecrated<S>6942</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S>: go out<S>3318</S> of the sanctuary<S>4720</S>; for thou hast trespassed<S>4603</S>; neither shall it be for thine honour<S>3519</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S>.
Then Uzziah<S>5818</S> was wroth<S>2196</S>, and had a censer<S>4730</S> in his hand<S>3027</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S>: and while he was wroth<S>2196</S> with the priests<S>3548</S>, the leprosy<S>6883</S> even rose up<S>2224</S> in his forehead<S>4696</S> before<S>6440</S> the priests<S>3548</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, from beside the incense<S>7004</S> altar<S>4196</S>.
And Azariah<S>5838</S> the chief<S>7218</S> priest<S>3548</S>, and all the priests<S>3548</S>, looked<S>6437</S> upon him, and, behold, he was leprous<S>6879</S> in his forehead<S>4696</S>, and they thrust him out<S>926</S> from thence; yea, himself hasted<S>1765</S> also to go out<S>3318</S>, because the LORD<S>3068</S> had smitten<S>5060</S> him.
And Uzziah<S>5818</S> the king<S>4428</S> was a leper<S>6879</S> unto the day<S>3117</S> of his death<S>4194</S>, and dwelt in<S>3427</S> a several<S>2669</S> <S>2669</S> house<S>1004</S>, being a leper<S>6879</S>; for he was cut off<S>1504</S> from the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and Jotham<S>3147</S> his son<S>1121</S> was over the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, judging<S>8199</S> the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>. <sup>several: Heb. free</sup>
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Uzziah<S>5818</S>, first<S>7223</S> and last<S>314</S>, did Isaiah<S>3470</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Amoz<S>531</S>, write<S>3789</S>.
So Uzziah<S>5818</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and they buried<S>6912</S> him with his fathers<S>1</S> in the field<S>7704</S> of the burial<S>6900</S> which belonged to the kings<S>4428</S>; for they said<S>559</S>, He is a leper<S>6879</S>: and Jotham<S>3147</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.

The LORD<S>3068</S> shewed<S>7200</S> me, and, behold, two<S>8147</S> baskets<S>1736</S> of figs<S>8384</S> were set<S>3259</S> before<S>6440</S> the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, after<S>310</S> that Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had carried away captive<S>1540</S> Jeconiah<S>3204</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoiakim<S>3079</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and the princes<S>8269</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, with the carpenters<S>2796</S> and smiths<S>4525</S>, from Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and had brought<S>935</S> them to Babylon<S>894</S>.
One<S>259</S> basket<S>1731</S> had very<S>3966</S> good<S>2896</S> figs<S>8384</S>, even like the figs<S>8384</S> that are first ripe<S>1073</S>: and the other<S>259</S> basket<S>1731</S> had very<S>3966</S> naughty<S>7451</S> figs<S>8384</S>, which could not be eaten<S>398</S>, they were so bad<S>7455</S>. <sup>they: Heb. for badness</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> unto me, What seest<S>7200</S> thou, Jeremiah<S>3414</S>? And I said<S>559</S>, Figs<S>8384</S>; the good<S>2896</S> figs<S>8384</S>, very<S>3966</S> good<S>2896</S>; and the evil<S>7451</S>, very<S>3966</S> evil<S>7451</S>, that cannot be eaten<S>398</S>, they are so evil<S>7455</S>.
Again the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Like these good<S>2896</S> figs<S>8384</S>, so will I acknowledge<S>5234</S> them that are carried away captive<S>1546</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, whom I have sent<S>7971</S> out of this place<S>4725</S> into the land<S>776</S> of the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> for their good<S>2896</S>. <sup>them: Heb. the captivity</sup>
For I will set<S>7760</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S> upon them for good<S>2896</S>, and I will bring them again<S>7725</S> to this land<S>776</S>: and I will build<S>1129</S> them, and not pull them down<S>2040</S>; and I will plant<S>5193</S> them, and not pluck them up<S>5428</S>.
And I will give<S>5414</S> them an heart<S>3820</S> to know<S>3045</S> me, that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>: and they shall be my people<S>5971</S>, and I will be their God<S>430</S>: for they shall return<S>7725</S> unto me with their whole heart<S>3820</S>.
And as the evil<S>7451</S> figs<S>8384</S>, which cannot be eaten<S>398</S>, they are so evil<S>7455</S>; surely thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, So will I give<S>5414</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and his princes<S>8269</S>, and the residue<S>7611</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, that remain<S>7604</S> in this land<S>776</S>, and them that dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>:
And I will deliver<S>5414</S> them to be removed<S>2189</S> <S>2113</S> into all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the earth<S>776</S> for their hurt<S>7451</S>, to be a reproach<S>2781</S> and a proverb<S>4912</S>, a taunt<S>8148</S> and a curse<S>7045</S>, in all places<S>4725</S> whither I shall drive<S>5080</S> them. <sup>to be removed: Heb. for removing, or, vexation</sup>
And I will send<S>7971</S> the sword<S>2719</S>, the famine<S>7458</S>, and the pestilence<S>1698</S>, among them, till they be consumed<S>8552</S> from off the land<S>127</S> that I gave<S>5414</S> unto them and to their fathers<S>1</S>.

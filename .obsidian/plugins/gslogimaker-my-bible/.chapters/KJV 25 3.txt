I am the man<S>1397</S> that hath seen<S>7200</S> affliction<S>6040</S> by the rod<S>7626</S> of his wrath<S>5678</S>.
He hath led<S>5090</S> me, and brought<S>3212</S> me into darkness<S>2822</S>, but not into light<S>216</S>.
Surely against me is he turned<S>7725</S>; he turneth<S>2015</S> his hand<S>3027</S> against me all the day<S>3117</S>.
My flesh<S>1320</S> and my skin<S>5785</S> hath he made old<S>1086</S>; he hath broken<S>7665</S> my bones<S>6106</S>.
He hath builded against<S>1129</S> me, and compassed<S>5362</S> me with gall<S>7219</S> and travail<S>8513</S>.
He hath set<S>3427</S> me in dark places<S>4285</S>, as they that be dead<S>4191</S> of old<S>5769</S>.
He hath hedged<S>1443</S> me about, that I cannot get out<S>3318</S>: he hath made my chain<S>5178</S> heavy<S>3513</S>.
Also when I cry<S>2199</S> and shout<S>7768</S>, he shutteth out<S>5640</S> my prayer<S>8605</S>.
He hath inclosed<S>1443</S> my ways<S>1870</S> with hewn stone<S>1496</S>, he hath made my paths<S>5410</S> crooked<S>5753</S>.
He was unto me as a bear<S>1677</S> lying in wait<S>693</S>, and as a lion<S>738</S> in secret places<S>4565</S>.
He hath turned aside<S>5493</S> my ways<S>1870</S>, and pulled me in pieces<S>6582</S>: he hath made<S>7760</S> me desolate<S>8074</S>.
He hath bent<S>1869</S> his bow<S>7198</S>, and set<S>5324</S> me as a mark<S>4307</S> for the arrow<S>2671</S>.
He hath caused the arrows<S>1121</S> of his quiver<S>827</S> to enter<S>935</S> into my reins<S>3629</S>. <sup>arrows: Heb. sons</sup>
I was a derision<S>7814</S> to all my people<S>5971</S>; and their song<S>5058</S> all the day<S>3117</S>.
He hath filled<S>7646</S> me with bitterness<S>4844</S>, he hath made me drunken<S>7301</S> with wormwood<S>3939</S>. <sup>bitterness: Heb. bitternesses</sup>
He hath also broken<S>1638</S> my teeth<S>8127</S> with gravel stones<S>2687</S>, he hath covered<S>3728</S> me with ashes<S>665</S>. <sup>covered: or, rolled me in the ashes</sup>
And thou hast removed<S>2186</S> my soul<S>5315</S> far off<S>2186</S> from peace<S>7965</S>: I forgat<S>5382</S> prosperity<S>2896</S>. <sup>prosperity: Heb. good</sup>
And I said<S>559</S>, My strength<S>5331</S> and my hope<S>8431</S> is perished<S>6</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>:
Remembering<S>2142</S> mine affliction<S>6040</S> and my misery<S>4788</S>, the wormwood<S>3939</S> and the gall<S>7219</S>. <sup>Remembering: or, Remember</sup>
My soul<S>5315</S> hath them still<S>2142</S> in remembrance<S>2142</S>, and is humbled<S>7743</S> in me. <sup>humbled: Heb. bowed</sup>
This I recall<S>7725</S> to my mind<S>3820</S>, therefore have I hope<S>3176</S>. <sup>recall: Heb. make to return to my heart</sup>
It is of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> mercies<S>2617</S> that we are not consumed<S>8552</S>, because his compassions<S>7356</S> fail<S>3615</S> not.
They are new<S>2319</S> every morning<S>1242</S>: great<S>7227</S> is thy faithfulness<S>530</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is my portion<S>2506</S>, saith<S>559</S> my soul<S>5315</S>; therefore will I hope<S>3176</S> in him.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is good<S>2896</S> unto them that wait<S>6960</S> for him, to the soul<S>5315</S> that seeketh<S>1875</S> him.
It is good<S>2896</S> that a man should both hope<S>3175</S> <S>2342</S> and quietly wait<S>1748</S> for the salvation<S>8668</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
It is good<S>2896</S> for a man<S>1397</S> that he bear<S>5375</S> the yoke<S>5923</S> in his youth<S>5271</S>.
He sitteth<S>3427</S> alone<S>910</S> and keepeth silence<S>1826</S>, because he hath borne<S>5190</S> it upon him.
He putteth<S>5414</S> his mouth<S>6310</S> in the dust<S>6083</S>; if so be there may be<S>3426</S> hope<S>8615</S>.
He giveth<S>5414</S> his cheek<S>3895</S> to him that smiteth<S>5221</S> him: he is filled full<S>7646</S> with reproach<S>2781</S>.
For the Lord<S>136</S> will not cast off<S>2186</S> for ever<S>5769</S>:
But though he cause grief<S>3013</S>, yet will he have compassion<S>7355</S> according to the multitude<S>7230</S> of his mercies<S>2617</S>.
For he doth not afflict<S>6031</S> willingly<S>3820</S> nor grieve<S>3013</S> the children<S>1121</S> of men<S>376</S>. <sup>willingly: Heb. from his heart</sup>
To crush<S>1792</S> under his feet<S>7272</S> all the prisoners<S>615</S> of the earth<S>776</S>,
To turn aside<S>5186</S> the right<S>4941</S> of a man<S>1397</S> before the face<S>6440</S> of the most High<S>5945</S>, <sup>the most High: or, a superior</sup>
To subvert<S>5791</S> a man<S>120</S> in his cause<S>7379</S>, the Lord<S>136</S> approveth<S>7200</S> not. <sup>approveth not: or, seeth not</sup>
Who is he that saith<S>559</S>, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord<S>136</S> commandeth<S>6680</S> it not?
Out of the mouth<S>6310</S> of the most High<S>5945</S> proceedeth<S>3318</S> not evil<S>7451</S> and good<S>2896</S>?
Wherefore doth a living<S>2416</S> man<S>120</S> complain<S>596</S>, a man<S>1397</S> for the punishment of his sins<S>2399</S>? <sup>complain: or, murmur</sup>
Let us search<S>2664</S> and try<S>2713</S> our ways<S>1870</S>, and turn again<S>7725</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Let us lift up<S>5375</S> our heart<S>3824</S> with our hands<S>3709</S> unto God<S>410</S> in the heavens<S>8064</S>.
We<S>5168</S> have transgressed<S>6586</S> and have rebelled<S>4784</S>: thou hast not pardoned<S>5545</S>.
Thou hast covered<S>5526</S> with anger<S>639</S>, and persecuted<S>7291</S> us: thou hast slain<S>2026</S>, thou hast not pitied<S>2550</S>.
Thou hast covered<S>5526</S> thyself with a cloud<S>6051</S>, that our prayer<S>8605</S> should not pass through<S>5674</S>.
Thou hast made<S>7760</S> us as the offscouring<S>5501</S> and refuse<S>3973</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of the people<S>5971</S>.
All our enemies<S>341</S> have opened<S>6475</S> their mouths<S>6310</S> against us.
Fear<S>6343</S> and a snare<S>6354</S> is come upon us, desolation<S>7612</S> and destruction<S>7667</S>.
Mine eye<S>5869</S> runneth down<S>3381</S> with rivers<S>6388</S> of water<S>4325</S> for the destruction<S>7667</S> of the daughter<S>1323</S> of my people<S>5971</S>.
Mine eye<S>5869</S> trickleth down<S>5064</S>, and ceaseth<S>1820</S> not, without any intermission<S>2014</S>,
Till the LORD<S>3068</S> look down<S>8259</S>, and behold<S>7200</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>.
Mine eye<S>5869</S> affecteth<S>5953</S> mine heart<S>5315</S> because of all the daughters<S>1323</S> of my city<S>5892</S>. <sup>mine heart: Heb. my soul</sup> <sup>because: or, more than all</sup>
Mine enemies<S>341</S> chased<S>6679</S> me sore<S>6679</S>, like a bird<S>6833</S>, without cause<S>2600</S>.
They have cut off<S>6789</S> my life<S>2416</S> in the dungeon<S>953</S>, and cast<S>3034</S> a stone<S>68</S> upon me.
Waters<S>4325</S> flowed over<S>6687</S> mine head<S>7218</S>; then I said<S>559</S>, I am cut off<S>1504</S>.
I called<S>7121</S> upon thy name<S>8034</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, out of the low<S>8482</S> dungeon<S>953</S>.
Thou hast heard<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>: hide<S>5956</S> not thine ear<S>241</S> at my breathing<S>7309</S>, at my cry<S>7775</S>.
Thou drewest near<S>7126</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that I called<S>7121</S> upon thee: thou saidst<S>559</S>, Fear<S>3372</S> not.
O Lord<S>136</S>, thou hast pleaded<S>7378</S> the causes<S>7379</S> of my soul<S>5315</S>; thou hast redeemed<S>1350</S> my life<S>2416</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, thou hast seen<S>7200</S> my wrong<S>5792</S>: judge<S>8199</S> thou my cause<S>4941</S>.
Thou hast seen<S>7200</S> all their vengeance<S>5360</S> and all their imaginations<S>4284</S> against me.
Thou hast heard<S>8085</S> their reproach<S>2781</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, and all their imaginations<S>4284</S> against me;
The lips<S>8193</S> of those that rose up<S>6965</S> against me, and their device<S>1902</S> against me all the day<S>3117</S>.
Behold<S>5027</S> their sitting down<S>3427</S>, and their rising up<S>7012</S>; I am their musick<S>4485</S>.
Render<S>7725</S> unto them a recompence<S>1576</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, according to the work<S>4639</S> of their hands<S>3027</S>.
Give<S>5414</S> them sorrow<S>4044</S> of heart<S>3820</S>, thy curse<S>8381</S> unto them. <sup>sorrow: or, obstinacy of heart</sup>
Persecute<S>7291</S> and destroy<S>8045</S> them in anger<S>639</S> from under the heavens<S>8064</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.

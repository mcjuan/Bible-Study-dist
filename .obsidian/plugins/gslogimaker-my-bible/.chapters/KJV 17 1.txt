Now it came to pass in the days<S>3117</S> of Ahasuerus<S>325</S>, (this is Ahasuerus<S>325</S> which reigned<S>4427</S>, from India<S>1912</S> even unto Ethiopia<S>3568</S>, over an hundred<S>3967</S> and seven<S>7651</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> provinces<S>4082</S>:)
That in those days<S>3117</S>, when the king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> sat<S>3427</S> on the throne<S>3678</S> of his kingdom<S>4438</S>, which was in Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S>,
In the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of his reign<S>4427</S>, he made<S>6213</S> a feast<S>4960</S> unto all his princes<S>8269</S> and his servants<S>5650</S>; the power<S>2428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S> and Media<S>4074</S>, the nobles<S>6579</S> and princes<S>8269</S> of the provinces<S>4082</S>, being before<S>6440</S> him:
When he shewed<S>7200</S> the riches<S>6239</S> of his glorious<S>3519</S> kingdom<S>4438</S> and the honour<S>3366</S> of his excellent<S>8597</S> majesty<S>1420</S> many<S>7227</S> days<S>3117</S>, even an hundred<S>3967</S> and fourscore<S>8084</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And when these days<S>3117</S> were expired<S>4390</S>, the king<S>4428</S> made<S>6213</S> a feast<S>4960</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S> that were present<S>4672</S> in Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S>, both unto great<S>1419</S> and small<S>6996</S>, seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, in the court<S>2691</S> of the garden<S>1594</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> palace<S>1055</S>; <sup>present: Heb. found</sup>
Where were white<S>2353</S>, green<S>3768</S>, and blue<S>8504</S>, hangings, fastened<S>270</S> with cords<S>2256</S> of fine linen<S>948</S> and purple<S>713</S> to silver<S>3701</S> rings<S>1550</S> and pillars<S>5982</S> of marble<S>8336</S>: the beds<S>4296</S> were of gold<S>2091</S> and silver<S>3701</S>, upon a pavement<S>7531</S> of red<S>923</S>, and blue<S>8504</S>, and white<S>1858</S>, and black<S>5508</S>, marble<S>8336</S>. <sup>blue, hangings: or, violet, etc</sup> <sup>of red: or, of porphyre, and marble and alabaster, and stone of blue colour</sup>
And they gave them drink<S>8248</S> in vessels<S>3627</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, (the vessels<S>3627</S> being diverse<S>8138</S> one from another<S>3627</S>,) and royal<S>4438</S> wine<S>3196</S> in abundance<S>7227</S>, according to the state<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S>. <sup>royal: Heb. wine of the kingdom</sup> <sup>state: Heb. hand</sup>
And the drinking<S>8360</S> was according to the law<S>1881</S>; none did compel<S>597</S>: for so the king<S>4428</S> had appointed<S>3245</S> to all the officers<S>7227</S> of his house<S>1004</S>, that they should do<S>6213</S> according to every man's<S>376</S> pleasure<S>7522</S>.
Also Vashti<S>2060</S> the queen<S>4436</S> made<S>6213</S> a feast<S>4960</S> for the women<S>802</S> in the royal<S>4438</S> house<S>1004</S> which belonged to king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S>.
On the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, when the heart<S>3820</S> of the king<S>4428</S> was merry<S>2896</S> with wine<S>3196</S>, he commanded<S>559</S> Mehuman<S>4104</S>, Biztha<S>968</S>, Harbona<S>2726</S>, Bigtha<S>903</S>, and Abagtha<S>5</S>, Zethar<S>2242</S>, and Carcas<S>3752</S>, the seven<S>7651</S> chamberlains<S>5631</S> that served<S>8334</S> in the presence<S>6440</S> of Ahasuerus<S>325</S> the king<S>4428</S>, <sup>chamberlains: or, eunuchs</sup>
To bring<S>935</S> Vashti<S>2060</S> the queen<S>4436</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> with the crown<S>3804</S> royal<S>4438</S>, to shew<S>7200</S> the people<S>5971</S> and the princes<S>8269</S> her beauty<S>3308</S>: for she was fair<S>2896</S> to look on<S>4758</S>. <sup>fair: Heb. good of countenance</sup>
But the queen<S>4436</S> Vashti<S>2060</S> refused<S>3985</S> to come<S>935</S> at the king's<S>4428</S> commandment<S>1697</S> by<S>3027</S> his chamberlains<S>5631</S>: therefore was the king<S>4428</S> very<S>3966</S> wroth<S>7107</S>, and his anger<S>2534</S> burned<S>1197</S> in him. <sup>by his: Heb. which was by the hand of his eunuchs</sup>
Then the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> to the wise men<S>2450</S>, which knew<S>3045</S> the times<S>6256</S>, (for so was the king's<S>4428</S> manner<S>1697</S> toward<S>6440</S> all that knew<S>3045</S> law<S>1881</S> and judgment<S>1779</S>:
And the next<S>7138</S> unto him was Carshena<S>3771</S>, Shethar<S>8369</S>, Admatha<S>133</S>, Tarshish<S>8659</S>, Meres<S>4825</S>, Marsena<S>4826</S>, and Memucan<S>4462</S>, the seven<S>7651</S> princes<S>8269</S> of Persia<S>6539</S> and Media<S>4074</S>, which saw<S>7200</S> the king's<S>4428</S> face<S>6440</S>, and which sat<S>3427</S> the first<S>7223</S> in the kingdom<S>4438</S>;)
What shall we do<S>6213</S> unto the queen<S>4436</S> Vashti<S>2060</S> according to law<S>1881</S>, because she hath not performed<S>6213</S> the commandment<S>3982</S> of the king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> by<S>3027</S> the chamberlains<S>5631</S>? <sup>What: Heb. What to do</sup>
And Memucan<S>4462</S> answered<S>559</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> and the princes<S>8269</S>, Vashti<S>2060</S> the queen<S>4436</S> hath not done wrong<S>5753</S> to the king<S>4428</S> only, but also to all the princes<S>8269</S>, and to all the people<S>5971</S> that are in all the provinces<S>4082</S> of the king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S>.
For this deed<S>1697</S> of the queen<S>4436</S> shall come abroad<S>3318</S> unto all women<S>802</S>, so that they shall despise<S>959</S> their husbands<S>1167</S> in their eyes<S>5869</S>, when it shall be reported<S>559</S>, The king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> commanded<S>559</S> Vashti<S>2060</S> the queen<S>4436</S> to be brought in<S>935</S> before<S>6440</S> him, but she came<S>935</S> not.
Likewise shall the ladies<S>8282</S> of Persia<S>6539</S> and Media<S>4074</S> say<S>559</S> this day<S>3117</S> unto all the king's<S>4428</S> princes<S>8269</S>, which have heard<S>8085</S> of the deed<S>1697</S> of the queen<S>4436</S>. Thus shall there arise too much<S>1767</S> contempt<S>963</S> and wrath<S>7110</S>.
If it please<S>2895</S> the king<S>4428</S>, let there go<S>3318</S> a royal<S>4438</S> commandment<S>1697</S> from him<S>6440</S>, and let it be written<S>3789</S> among the laws<S>1881</S> of the Persians<S>6539</S> and the Medes<S>4074</S>, that it be not altered<S>5674</S>, That Vashti<S>2060</S> come<S>935</S> no more before<S>6440</S> king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S>; and let the king<S>4428</S> give<S>5414</S> her royal estate<S>4438</S> unto another<S>7468</S> that is better<S>2896</S> than she. <sup>If it: Heb.

And when the king's<S>4428</S> decree<S>6599</S> which he shall make<S>6213</S> shall be published<S>8085</S> throughout all his empire<S>4438</S>, (for it is great<S>7227</S>,) all the wives<S>802</S> shall give<S>5414</S> to their husbands<S>1167</S> honour<S>3366</S>, both to great<S>1419</S> and small<S>6996</S>.
And the saying<S>1697</S> pleased<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> the king<S>4428</S> and the princes<S>8269</S>; and the king<S>4428</S> did<S>6213</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of Memucan<S>4462</S>: <sup>pleased: Heb. was good in the eyes of the king</sup>

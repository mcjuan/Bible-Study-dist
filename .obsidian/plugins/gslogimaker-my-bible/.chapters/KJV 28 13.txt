Therefore I will be unto them as a lion<S>7826</S>: as a leopard<S>5246</S> by the way<S>1870</S> will I observe<S>7789</S> them:
I will meet<S>6298</S> them as a bear<S>1677</S> that is bereaved<S>7909</S> of her whelps, and will rend<S>7167</S> the caul<S>5458</S> of their heart<S>3820</S>, and there will I devour<S>398</S> them like a lion<S>3833</S>: the wild<S>7704</S> beast<S>2416</S> shall tear<S>1234</S> them. <sup>wild: Heb. beast of the field</sup>

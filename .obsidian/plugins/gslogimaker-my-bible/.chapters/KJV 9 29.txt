Now the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered together<S>6908</S> all their armies<S>4264</S> to Aphek<S>663</S>: and the Israelites<S>3478</S> pitched<S>2583</S> by a fountain<S>5869</S> which is in Jezreel<S>3157</S>.
And the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> passed on<S>5674</S> by hundreds<S>3967</S>, and by thousands<S>505</S>: but David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> passed on<S>5674</S> in the rereward<S>314</S> with Achish<S>397</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> the princes<S>8269</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, What do these Hebrews<S>5680</S> here? And Achish<S>397</S> said<S>559</S> unto the princes<S>8269</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, Is not this David<S>1732</S>, the servant<S>5650</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which hath been with me these days<S>3117</S>, or these years<S>8141</S>, and I have found<S>4672</S> no fault<S>3972</S> in him since<S>3117</S> he fell<S>5307</S> unto me unto this day<S>3117</S>?
And the princes<S>8269</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> were wroth<S>7107</S> with him; and the princes<S>8269</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Make<S>7725</S> this fellow<S>376</S> return<S>7725</S>, that he may go again<S>7725</S> to his place<S>4725</S> which thou hast appointed<S>6485</S> him, and let him not go down<S>3381</S> with us to battle<S>4421</S>, lest in the battle<S>4421</S> he be an adversary<S>7854</S> to us: for wherewith should he reconcile<S>7521</S> himself unto his master<S>113</S>? should it not be with the heads<S>7218</S> of these men<S>582</S>?
Is not this David<S>1732</S>, of whom they sang<S>6030</S> one to another in dances<S>4246</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Saul<S>7586</S> slew<S>5221</S> his thousands<S>505</S>, and David<S>1732</S> his ten thousands<S>7233</S>?
Then Achish<S>397</S> called<S>7121</S> David<S>1732</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Surely, as the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, thou hast been upright<S>3477</S>, and thy going out<S>3318</S> and thy coming in<S>935</S> with me in the host<S>4264</S> is good<S>2896</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>: for I have not found<S>4672</S> evil<S>7451</S> in thee since the day<S>3117</S> of thy coming<S>935</S> unto me unto this day<S>3117</S>: nevertheless the lords<S>5633</S> favour<S>2896</S> thee not<S>5869</S>. <sup>the lords: Heb. thou art not good in the eyes of the lords</sup>
Wherefore now return<S>7725</S>, and go<S>3212</S> in peace<S>7965</S>, that thou displease<S>6213</S> <S>7451</S> <S>5869</S> not the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>. <sup>displease: Heb. do not evil in the eyes of the lords</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto Achish<S>397</S>, But what have I done<S>6213</S>? and what hast thou found<S>4672</S> in thy servant<S>5650</S> so long as<S>3117</S> I have been with thee<S>6440</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>, that I may not go<S>935</S> fight<S>3898</S> against the enemies<S>341</S> of my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>? <sup>with: Heb. before thee</sup>
And Achish<S>397</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> to David<S>1732</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that thou art good<S>2896</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>, as an angel<S>4397</S> of God<S>430</S>: notwithstanding the princes<S>8269</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> have said<S>559</S>, He shall not go up<S>5927</S> with us to the battle<S>4421</S>.
Wherefore now rise up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S> with thy master's<S>113</S> servants<S>5650</S> that are come<S>935</S> with thee: and as soon as ye be up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and have light<S>215</S>, depart<S>3212</S>.
So David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> rose up early<S>7925</S> to depart<S>3212</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, to return<S>7725</S> into the land<S>776</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>. And the Philistines<S>6430</S> went up<S>5927</S> to Jezreel<S>3157</S>.

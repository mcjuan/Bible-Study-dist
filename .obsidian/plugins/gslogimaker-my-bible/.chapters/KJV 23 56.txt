Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Keep<S>8104</S> ye judgment<S>4941</S>, and do<S>6213</S> justice<S>6666</S>: for my salvation<S>3444</S> is near<S>7138</S> to come<S>935</S>, and my righteousness<S>6666</S> to be revealed<S>1540</S>. <sup>judgment: or, equity</sup>
Blessed<S>835</S> is the man<S>582</S> that doeth<S>6213</S> this, and the son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S> that layeth hold<S>2388</S> on it; that keepeth<S>8104</S> the sabbath<S>7676</S> from polluting<S>2490</S> it, and keepeth<S>8104</S> his hand<S>3027</S> from doing<S>6213</S> any evil<S>7451</S>.
Neither let the son<S>1121</S> of the stranger<S>5236</S>, that hath joined<S>3867</S> himself to the LORD<S>3068</S>, speak<S>559</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> hath utterly<S>914</S> separated<S>914</S> me from his people<S>5971</S>: neither let the eunuch<S>5631</S> say<S>559</S>, Behold, I am a dry<S>3002</S> tree<S>6086</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> unto the eunuchs<S>5631</S> that keep<S>8104</S> my sabbaths<S>7676</S>, and choose<S>977</S> the things that please<S>2654</S> me, and take hold<S>2388</S> of my covenant<S>1285</S>;
Even unto them will I give<S>5414</S> in mine house<S>1004</S> and within my walls<S>2346</S> a place<S>3027</S> and a name<S>8034</S> better<S>2896</S> than of sons<S>1121</S> and of daughters<S>1323</S>: I will give<S>5414</S> them an everlasting<S>5769</S> name<S>8034</S>, that shall not be cut off<S>3772</S>.
Also the sons<S>1121</S> of the stranger<S>5236</S>, that join<S>3867</S> themselves to the LORD<S>3068</S>, to serve<S>8334</S> him, and to love<S>157</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to be his servants<S>5650</S>, every one that keepeth<S>8104</S> the sabbath<S>7676</S> from polluting<S>2490</S> it, and taketh hold<S>2388</S> of my covenant<S>1285</S>;
Even them will I bring<S>935</S> to my holy<S>6944</S> mountain<S>2022</S>, and make them joyful<S>8055</S> in my house<S>1004</S> of prayer<S>8605</S>: their burnt offerings<S>5930</S> and their sacrifices<S>2077</S> shall be accepted<S>7522</S> upon mine altar<S>4196</S>; for mine house<S>1004</S> shall be called<S>7121</S> an house<S>1004</S> of prayer<S>8605</S> for all people<S>5971</S>.
The Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> which gathereth<S>6908</S> the outcasts<S>1760</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> saith<S>5002</S>, Yet will I gather<S>6908</S> others to him, beside those that are gathered<S>6908</S> unto him. <sup>beside: Heb. to his gathered</sup>
All ye beasts<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, come<S>857</S> to devour<S>398</S>, yea, all ye beasts<S>2416</S> in the forest<S>3293</S>.
His watchmen<S>6822</S> are blind<S>5787</S>: they are all ignorant<S>3045</S>, they are all dumb<S>483</S> dogs<S>3611</S>, they cannot<S>3201</S> bark<S>5024</S>; sleeping<S>1957</S>, lying down<S>7901</S>, loving<S>157</S> to slumber<S>5123</S>. <sup>sleeping: or, dreaming, or, talking in their sleep</sup>
Yea, they are greedy<S>5794</S> <S>5315</S> dogs<S>3611</S> which can<S>3045</S> never have<S>3045</S> enough<S>7654</S>, and they are shepherds<S>7462</S> that cannot understand<S>995</S>: they all look<S>6437</S> to their own way<S>1870</S>, every one<S>376</S> for his gain<S>1215</S>, from his quarter<S>7097</S>. <sup>greedy: Heb. strong of appetite</sup> <sup>can: Heb. know not to be satisfied</sup>
Come<S>857</S> ye, say they, I will fetch<S>3947</S> wine<S>3196</S>, and we will fill<S>5433</S> ourselves with strong drink<S>7941</S>; and to morrow<S>4279</S> shall be as this day<S>3117</S>, and much<S>3966</S> more<S>3499</S> abundant<S>1419</S>.

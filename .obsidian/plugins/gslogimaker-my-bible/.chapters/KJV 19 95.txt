O come<S>3212</S>, let us sing<S>7442</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: let us make a joyful noise<S>7321</S> to the rock<S>6697</S> of our salvation<S>3468</S>.
Let us come<S>6923</S> before his presence<S>6440</S> with thanksgiving<S>8426</S>, and make a joyful noise<S>7321</S> unto him with psalms<S>2158</S>. <sup>come: Heb. prevent his face</sup>
For the LORD<S>3068</S> is a great<S>1419</S> God<S>410</S>, and a great<S>1419</S> King<S>4428</S> above all gods<S>430</S>.
In his hand<S>3027</S> are the deep places<S>4278</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: the strength<S>8443</S> of the hills<S>2022</S> is his also. <sup>In: Heb. In whose</sup> <sup>the strength: or, the heights of the hills are his</sup>
The sea<S>3220</S> is his, and he made<S>6213</S> it: and his hands<S>3027</S> formed<S>3335</S> the dry<S>3006</S> land. <sup>The sea: Heb. Whose the sea is</sup>
O come<S>935</S>, let us worship<S>7812</S> and bow down<S>3766</S>: let us kneel<S>1288</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our maker<S>6213</S>.
For he is our God<S>430</S>; and we are the people<S>5971</S> of his pasture<S>4830</S>, and the sheep<S>6629</S> of his hand<S>3027</S>. To day<S>3117</S> if ye will hear<S>8085</S> his voice<S>6963</S>,
Harden<S>7185</S> not your heart<S>3824</S>, as in the provocation<S>4808</S>, and as in the day<S>3117</S> of temptation<S>4531</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>: <sup>provocation: Heb. contention</sup>
When your fathers<S>1</S> tempted<S>5254</S> me, proved<S>974</S> me, and saw<S>7200</S> my work<S>6467</S>.
Forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S> long was I grieved<S>6962</S> with this generation<S>1755</S>, and said<S>559</S>, It is a people<S>5971</S> that do err<S>8582</S> in their heart<S>3824</S>, and they have not known<S>3045</S> my ways<S>1870</S>:
Unto whom I sware<S>7650</S> in my wrath<S>639</S> that they should not enter<S>935</S> into my rest<S>4496</S>. <sup>that: Heb. if they enter into my rest</sup>

At that time<S>6256</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, they shall bring out<S>3318</S> the bones<S>6106</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and the bones<S>6106</S> of his princes<S>8269</S>, and the bones<S>6106</S> of the priests<S>3548</S>, and the bones<S>6106</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S>, and the bones<S>6106</S> of the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, out of their graves<S>6913</S>:
And they shall spread<S>7849</S> them before the sun<S>8121</S>, and the moon<S>3394</S>, and all the host<S>6635</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, whom they have loved<S>157</S>, and whom they have served<S>5647</S>, and after<S>310</S> whom they have walked<S>1980</S>, and whom they have sought<S>1875</S>, and whom they have worshipped<S>7812</S>: they shall not be gathered<S>622</S>, nor be buried<S>6912</S>; they shall be for dung<S>1828</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>.
And death<S>4194</S> shall be chosen<S>977</S> rather than life<S>2416</S> by all the residue<S>7611</S> of them that remain<S>7604</S> of this evil<S>7451</S> family<S>4940</S>, which remain<S>7604</S> in all the places<S>4725</S> whither I have driven<S>5080</S> them, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>.
Moreover thou shalt say<S>559</S> unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Shall they fall<S>5307</S>, and not arise<S>6965</S>? shall he turn away<S>7725</S>, and not return<S>7725</S>?
Why then is this people<S>5971</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> slidden back<S>7725</S> by a perpetual<S>5329</S> backsliding<S>4878</S>? they hold<S>2388</S> fast deceit<S>8649</S>, they refuse<S>3985</S> to return<S>7725</S>.
I hearkened<S>7181</S> and heard<S>8085</S>, but they spake not aright<S>1696</S>: no man<S>376</S> repented<S>5162</S> him of<S>5921</S> his wickedness<S>7451</S>, saying<S>559</S>, What have I done<S>6213</S>? every one turned<S>7725</S> to his course<S>4794</S>, as the horse<S>5483</S> rusheth<S>7857</S> into the battle<S>4421</S>.
Yea, the stork<S>2624</S> in the heaven<S>8064</S> knoweth<S>3045</S> her appointed times<S>4150</S>; and the turtle<S>8449</S> and the crane<S>5483</S> and the swallow<S>5693</S> observe<S>8104</S> the time<S>6256</S> of their coming<S>935</S>; but my people<S>5971</S> know<S>3045</S> not the judgment<S>4941</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
How do ye say<S>559</S>, We are wise<S>2450</S>, and the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is with us? Lo, certainly<S>403</S> in vain<S>8267</S> made<S>6213</S> he it; the pen<S>5842</S> of the scribes<S>5608</S> is in vain<S>8267</S>. <sup>in vain made: or, the false pen of the scribes worketh for falsehood</sup>
The wise<S>2450</S> men are ashamed<S>3001</S>, they are dismayed<S>2865</S> and taken<S>3920</S>: lo, they have rejected<S>3988</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and what wisdom<S>2451</S> is in them? <sup>The wise: or, Have they been ashamed, etc</sup> <sup>what: Heb. the wisdom of what thing</sup>
Therefore will I give<S>5414</S> their wives<S>802</S> unto others<S>312</S>, and their fields<S>7704</S> to them that shall inherit<S>3423</S> them: for every one from the least<S>6996</S> even unto the greatest<S>1419</S> is given<S>1214</S> to covetousness<S>1215</S>, from the prophet<S>5030</S> even unto the priest<S>3548</S> every one dealeth<S>6213</S> falsely<S>8267</S>.
For they have healed<S>7495</S> the hurt<S>7667</S> of the daughter<S>1323</S> of my people<S>5971</S> slightly<S>7043</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Peace<S>7965</S>, peace<S>7965</S>; when there is no peace<S>7965</S>.
Were they ashamed<S>3001</S> when they had committed<S>6213</S> abomination<S>8441</S>? nay, they were not at all<S>954</S> ashamed<S>954</S>, neither could<S>3045</S> they blush<S>3637</S>: therefore shall they fall<S>5307</S> among them that fall<S>5307</S>: in the time<S>6256</S> of their visitation<S>6486</S> they shall be cast down<S>3782</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>I will: or, In gathering I will consume</sup>
I will surely<S>622</S> consume<S>5486</S> them, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: there shall be no grapes<S>6025</S> on the vine<S>1612</S>, nor figs<S>8384</S> on the fig tree<S>8384</S>, and the leaf<S>5929</S> shall fade<S>5034</S>; and the things that I have given<S>5414</S> them shall pass away<S>5674</S> from them.
Why do we sit still<S>3427</S>? assemble<S>622</S> yourselves, and let us enter<S>935</S> into the defenced<S>4013</S> cities<S>5892</S>, and let us be silent<S>1826</S> there: for the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> hath put us to silence<S>1826</S>, and given us water<S>4325</S> of gall<S>7219</S> to drink<S>8248</S>, because we have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>gall: or, poison</sup>
We looked<S>6960</S> for peace<S>7965</S>, but no good<S>2896</S> came; and for a time<S>6256</S> of health<S>4832</S>, and behold trouble<S>1205</S>!
The snorting<S>5170</S> of his horses<S>5483</S> was heard<S>8085</S> from Dan<S>1835</S>: the whole land<S>776</S> trembled<S>7493</S> at the sound<S>6963</S> of the neighing<S>4684</S> of his strong ones<S>47</S>; for they are come<S>935</S>, and have devoured<S>398</S> the land<S>776</S>, and all<S>4393</S> that is in it; the city<S>5892</S>, and those that dwell<S>3427</S> therein. <sup>all: Heb. the fulness thereof</sup>
For, behold, I will send<S>7971</S> serpents<S>5175</S>, cockatrices<S>6848</S>, among you, which will not be charmed<S>3908</S>, and they shall bite<S>5391</S> you, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
When I would comfort<S>4010</S> myself against sorrow<S>3015</S>, my heart<S>3820</S> is faint<S>1742</S> in me. <sup>in: Heb. upon</sup>
Behold the voice<S>6963</S> of the cry<S>7775</S> of the daughter<S>1323</S> of my people<S>5971</S> because of them that dwell in a far<S>4801</S> country<S>776</S>: Is not the LORD<S>3068</S> in Zion<S>6726</S>? is not her king<S>4428</S> in her? Why have they provoked me to anger<S>3707</S> with their graven images<S>6456</S>, and with strange<S>5236</S> vanities<S>1892</S>? <sup>them: Heb. the country of them that are far off</sup>
The harvest<S>7105</S> is past<S>5674</S>, the summer<S>7019</S> is ended<S>3615</S>, and we are not saved<S>3467</S>.

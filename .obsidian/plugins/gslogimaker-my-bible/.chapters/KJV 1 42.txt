Now when Jacob<S>3290</S> saw<S>7200</S> that there was<S>3426</S> corn<S>7668</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> unto his sons<S>1121</S>, Why do ye look<S>7200</S> one upon another?
And he said<S>559</S>, Behold, I have heard<S>8085</S> that there is<S>3426</S> corn<S>7668</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>: get you down<S>3381</S> thither, and buy<S>7666</S> for us from thence; that we may live<S>2421</S>, and not die<S>4191</S>.
And Joseph's<S>3130</S> ten<S>6235</S> brethren<S>251</S> went down<S>3381</S> to buy<S>7666</S> corn<S>1250</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>.
But Benjamin<S>1144</S>, Joseph's<S>3130</S> brother<S>251</S>, Jacob<S>3290</S> sent<S>7971</S> not with his brethren<S>251</S>; for he said<S>559</S>, Lest peradventure<S>6435</S> mischief<S>611</S> befall him<S>7122</S>.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came<S>935</S> to buy<S>7666</S> corn among<S>8432</S> those that came<S>935</S>: for the famine<S>7458</S> was in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> was the governor<S>7989</S> over the land<S>776</S>, and he it was that sold<S>7666</S> to all the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>: and Joseph's<S>3130</S> brethren<S>251</S> came<S>935</S>, and bowed down<S>7812</S> themselves before him with their faces<S>639</S> to the earth<S>776</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> saw<S>7200</S> his brethren<S>251</S>, and he knew<S>5234</S> them, but made himself strange<S>5234</S> unto them, and spake<S>1696</S> roughly<S>7186</S> unto them; and he said<S>559</S> unto them, Whence<S>370</S> come<S>935</S> ye? And they said<S>559</S>, From the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> to buy<S>7666</S> food<S>400</S>. <sup>roughly: Heb. hard things with them</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> knew<S>5234</S> his brethren<S>251</S>, but they knew<S>5234</S> not him.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> remembered<S>2142</S> the dreams<S>2472</S> which he dreamed<S>2492</S> of them, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Ye are spies<S>7270</S>; to see<S>7200</S> the nakedness<S>6172</S> of the land<S>776</S> ye are come<S>935</S>.
And they said<S>559</S> unto him, Nay, my lord<S>113</S>, but to buy<S>7666</S> food<S>400</S> are thy servants<S>5650</S> come<S>935</S>.
We<S>5168</S> are all one<S>259</S> man's<S>376</S> sons<S>1121</S>; we are true<S>3651</S> men, thy servants<S>5650</S> are no spies<S>7270</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Nay, but to see<S>7200</S> the nakedness<S>6172</S> of the land<S>776</S> ye are come<S>935</S>.
And they said<S>559</S>, Thy servants<S>5650</S> are twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> brethren<S>251</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>; and, behold, the youngest<S>6996</S> is this day<S>3117</S> with our father<S>1</S>, and one<S>259</S> is not.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, That is it that I spake<S>1696</S> unto you, saying<S>559</S>, Ye are spies<S>7270</S>:
Hereby<S>2063</S> ye shall be proved<S>974</S>: By the life<S>2416</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> ye shall not go forth<S>3318</S> hence, except your youngest<S>6996</S> brother<S>251</S> come<S>935</S> hither.
Send<S>7971</S> one<S>259</S> of you, and let him fetch<S>3947</S> your brother<S>251</S>, and ye shall be kept in prison<S>631</S>, that your words<S>1697</S> may be proved<S>974</S>, whether there be any truth<S>571</S> in<S>854</S> you: or else<S>3808</S> by the life<S>2416</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> surely ye are spies<S>7270</S>. <sup>kept: Heb. bound</sup>
And he put them all together<S>622</S> into ward<S>4929</S> three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>. <sup>put: Heb. gathered</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto them the third<S>7992</S> day<S>3117</S>, This do<S>6213</S>, and live<S>2421</S>; for I fear<S>3373</S> God<S>430</S>:
If ye be true<S>3651</S> men, let one<S>259</S> of your brethren<S>251</S> be bound<S>631</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of your prison<S>4929</S>: go<S>3212</S> ye, carry<S>935</S> corn<S>7668</S> for the famine<S>7459</S> of your houses<S>1004</S>:
But bring<S>935</S> your youngest<S>6996</S> brother<S>251</S> unto me; so shall your words<S>1697</S> be verified<S>539</S>, and ye shall not die<S>4191</S>. And they did<S>6213</S> so.
And they said<S>559</S> one<S>376</S> to another<S>251</S>, We are verily<S>61</S> guilty<S>818</S> concerning our brother<S>251</S>, in that<S>834</S> we saw<S>7200</S> the anguish<S>6869</S> of his soul<S>5315</S>, when he besought<S>2603</S> us, and we would not hear<S>8085</S>; therefore is this distress<S>6869</S> come<S>935</S> upon us.
And Reuben<S>7205</S> answered<S>6030</S> them, saying<S>559</S>, Spake I<S>559</S> not unto you, saying<S>559</S>, Do not sin<S>2398</S> against the child<S>3206</S>; and ye would not hear<S>8085</S>? therefore, behold, also his blood<S>1818</S> is required<S>1875</S>.
And they knew<S>3045</S> not that Joseph<S>3130</S> understood<S>8085</S> them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter<S>3887</S>. <sup>he spake: Heb. an interpreter was between them</sup>
And he turned himself about<S>5437</S> from them, and wept<S>1058</S>; and returned to them again<S>7725</S>, and communed<S>1696</S> with them, and took<S>3947</S> from them Simeon<S>8095</S>, and bound<S>631</S> him before their eyes<S>5869</S>.
Then Joseph<S>3130</S> commanded<S>6680</S> to fill<S>4390</S> their sacks<S>3627</S> with corn<S>1250</S>, and to restore<S>7725</S> every man's<S>376</S> money<S>3701</S> into his sack<S>8242</S>, and to give<S>5414</S> them provision<S>6720</S> for the way<S>1870</S>: and thus<S>3651</S> did he<S>6213</S> unto them.
And they laded<S>5375</S> their asses<S>2543</S> with the corn<S>7668</S>, and departed<S>3212</S> thence.
And as one<S>259</S> of them opened<S>6605</S> his sack<S>8242</S> to give<S>5414</S> his ass<S>2543</S> provender<S>4554</S> in the inn<S>4411</S>, he espied<S>7200</S> his money<S>3701</S>; for, behold, it was in his sack's<S>572</S> mouth<S>6310</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, My money<S>3701</S> is restored<S>7725</S>; and, lo<S>2009</S>, it is even in my sack<S>572</S>: and their heart<S>3820</S> failed<S>3318</S> them, and they were afraid<S>2729</S>, saying<S>559</S> one<S>376</S> to another<S>251</S>, What is this that God<S>430</S> hath done<S>6213</S> unto us? <sup>failed: Heb. went forth</sup>
And they came<S>935</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S> their father<S>1</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and told<S>5046</S> him all that befell<S>7136</S> unto them; saying<S>559</S>,
The man<S>376</S>, who is the lord<S>113</S> of the land<S>776</S>, spake<S>1696</S> roughly<S>7186</S> to us, and took<S>5414</S> us for spies<S>7270</S> of the country<S>776</S>. <sup>roughly: Heb. with us hard things</sup>
And we said<S>559</S> unto him, We are true<S>3651</S> men; we are no spies<S>7270</S>:
We be twelve<S>6240</S> <S>8147</S> brethren<S>251</S>, sons<S>1121</S> of our father<S>1</S>; one<S>259</S> is not, and the youngest<S>6996</S> is this day<S>3117</S> with our father<S>1</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>.
And the man<S>376</S>, the lord<S>113</S> of the country<S>776</S>, said<S>559</S> unto us, Hereby shall I know<S>3045</S> that ye are true<S>3651</S> men; leave<S>3240</S> one<S>259</S> of your brethren<S>251</S> here with me, and take<S>3947</S> food for the famine<S>7459</S> of your households<S>1004</S>, and be gone<S>3212</S>:
And bring<S>935</S> your youngest<S>6996</S> brother<S>251</S> unto me: then shall I know<S>3045</S> that ye are no spies<S>7270</S>, but that ye are true<S>3651</S> men: so will I deliver<S>5414</S> you your brother<S>251</S>, and ye shall traffick<S>5503</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
And it came to pass as they emptied<S>7324</S> their sacks<S>8242</S>, that, behold, every man's<S>376</S> bundle<S>6872</S> of money<S>3701</S> was in his sack<S>8242</S>: and when both they and their father<S>1</S> saw<S>7200</S> the bundles<S>6872</S> of money<S>3701</S>, they were afraid<S>3372</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> their father<S>1</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Me have ye bereaved<S>7921</S> of my children: Joseph<S>3130</S> is not, and Simeon<S>8095</S> is not, and ye will take<S>3947</S> Benjamin<S>1144</S> away: all these things are against me.
And Reuben<S>7205</S> spake<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Slay<S>4191</S> my two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S>, if I bring<S>935</S> him not to thee: deliver<S>5414</S> him into my hand<S>3027</S>, and I will bring him to thee again<S>7725</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, My son<S>1121</S> shall not go down<S>3381</S> with you; for his brother<S>251</S> is dead<S>4191</S>, and he is left<S>7604</S> alone: if mischief<S>611</S> befall<S>7122</S> him by the way<S>1870</S> in the which ye go<S>3212</S>, then shall ye bring down<S>3381</S> my gray hairs<S>7872</S> with sorrow<S>3015</S> to the grave<S>7585</S>.

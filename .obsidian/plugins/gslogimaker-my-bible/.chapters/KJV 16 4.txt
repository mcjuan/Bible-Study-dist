But it came to pass, that when Sanballat<S>5571</S> heard<S>8085</S> that we builded<S>1129</S> the wall<S>2346</S>, he was wroth<S>2734</S>, and took great<S>7235</S> indignation<S>3707</S>, and mocked<S>3932</S> the Jews<S>3064</S>.
And he spake<S>559</S> before<S>6440</S> his brethren<S>251</S> and the army<S>2428</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>, and said<S>559</S>, What do<S>6213</S> these feeble<S>537</S> Jews<S>3064</S>? will they fortify<S>5800</S> themselves? will they sacrifice<S>2076</S>? will they make an end<S>3615</S> in a day<S>3117</S>? will they revive<S>2421</S> the stones<S>68</S> out of the heaps<S>6194</S> of the rubbish<S>6083</S> which are burned<S>8313</S>? <sup>fortify: Heb. leave to themselves</sup>
Now Tobiah<S>2900</S> the Ammonite<S>5984</S> was by him<S>681</S>, and he said<S>559</S>, Even that which they build<S>1129</S>, if a fox<S>7776</S> go up<S>5927</S>, he shall even break down<S>6555</S> their stone<S>68</S> wall<S>2346</S>.
Hear<S>8085</S>, O our God<S>430</S>; for we are despised<S>939</S>: and turn<S>7725</S> their reproach<S>2781</S> upon their own head<S>7218</S>, and give<S>5414</S> them for a prey<S>961</S> in the land<S>776</S> of captivity<S>7633</S>: <sup>despised: Heb. despite</sup>
And cover<S>3680</S> not their iniquity<S>5771</S>, and let not their sin<S>2403</S> be blotted out<S>4229</S> from before<S>6440</S> thee: for they have provoked thee to anger<S>3707</S> before the builders<S>1129</S>.
So built<S>1129</S> we the wall<S>2346</S>; and all the wall<S>2346</S> was joined together<S>7194</S> unto the half<S>2677</S> thereof: for the people<S>5971</S> had a mind<S>3820</S> to work<S>6213</S>.
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat<S>5571</S>, and Tobiah<S>2900</S>, and the Arabians<S>6163</S>, and the Ammonites<S>5984</S>, and the Ashdodites<S>796</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that the walls<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> were made up<S>724</S> <S>5927</S>, and that the breaches<S>6555</S> began<S>2490</S> to be stopped<S>5640</S>, then they were very<S>3966</S> wroth<S>2734</S>, <sup>were made up: Heb. ascended</sup>
And conspired<S>7194</S> all of them together<S>3162</S> to come<S>935</S> and to fight<S>3898</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and to hinder<S>6213</S> <S>8442</S> it. <sup>to hinder: Heb. to make an error to it</sup>
Nevertheless we made our prayer<S>6419</S> unto our God<S>430</S>, and set<S>5975</S> a watch<S>4929</S> against them day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S>, because<S>6440</S> of them.
And Judah<S>3063</S> said<S>559</S>, The strength<S>3581</S> of the bearers of burdens<S>5449</S> is decayed<S>3782</S>, and there is much<S>7235</S> rubbish<S>6083</S>; so that we are not able<S>3201</S> to build<S>1129</S> the wall<S>2346</S>.
And our adversaries<S>6862</S> said<S>559</S>, They shall not know<S>3045</S>, neither see<S>7200</S>, till we come<S>935</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> among<S>8432</S> them, and slay<S>2026</S> them, and cause the work<S>4399</S> to cease<S>7673</S>.
And it came to pass, that when the Jews<S>3064</S> which dwelt<S>3427</S> by them<S>681</S> came<S>935</S>, they said<S>559</S> unto us ten<S>6235</S> times<S>6471</S>, From all places<S>4725</S> whence ye shall return<S>7725</S> unto us they will be upon you. <sup>From all: or, That from all places ye must return to us</sup>
Therefore set<S>5975</S> I in the lower<S>8482</S> places<S>4725</S> behind<S>310</S> the wall<S>2346</S>, and on the higher places<S>6706</S> <S>6708</S>, I even set<S>5975</S> the people<S>5971</S> after their families<S>4940</S> with their swords<S>2719</S>, their spears<S>7420</S>, and their bows<S>7198</S>. <sup>in the: Heb. from the lower parts of the place, etc</sup>
And I looked<S>7200</S>, and rose up<S>6965</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto the nobles<S>2715</S>, and to the rulers<S>5461</S>, and to the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, Be not ye afraid<S>3372</S> of them<S>6440</S>: remember<S>2142</S> the Lord<S>136</S>, which is great<S>1419</S> and terrible<S>3372</S>, and fight<S>3898</S> for your brethren<S>251</S>, your sons<S>1121</S>, and your daughters<S>1323</S>, your wives<S>802</S>, and your houses<S>1004</S>.
And it came to pass, when our enemies<S>341</S> heard<S>8085</S> that it was known<S>3045</S> unto us, and God<S>430</S> had brought<S>6565</S> their counsel<S>6098</S> to nought<S>6565</S>, that we returned<S>7725</S> all of us to the wall<S>2346</S>, every one<S>376</S> unto his work<S>4399</S>.
And it came to pass from that time<S>3117</S> forth, that the half<S>2677</S> of my servants<S>5288</S> wrought<S>6213</S> in the work<S>4399</S>, and the other half<S>2677</S> of them held<S>2388</S> both the spears<S>7420</S>, the shields<S>4043</S>, and the bows<S>7198</S>, and the habergeons<S>8302</S>; and the rulers<S>8269</S> were behind<S>310</S> all the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
They which builded<S>1129</S> on the wall<S>2346</S>, and they that bare<S>5375</S> burdens<S>5447</S>, with those that laded<S>6006</S>, every one with one<S>259</S> of his hands<S>3027</S> wrought<S>6213</S> in the work<S>4399</S>, and with the other<S>259</S> hand held<S>2388</S> a weapon<S>7973</S>.
For the builders<S>1129</S>, every one<S>376</S> had his sword<S>2719</S> girded<S>631</S> by his side<S>4975</S>, and so builded<S>1129</S>. And he that sounded<S>8628</S> the trumpet<S>7782</S> was by me<S>681</S>. <sup>by his side: Heb. on his loins</sup>
And I said<S>559</S> unto the nobles<S>2715</S>, and to the rulers<S>5461</S>, and to the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, The work<S>4399</S> is great<S>7235</S> and large<S>7342</S>, and we are separated<S>6504</S> upon the wall<S>2346</S>, one<S>376</S> far from<S>7350</S> another<S>251</S>.
In what place<S>4725</S> therefore ye hear<S>8085</S> the sound<S>6963</S> of the trumpet<S>7782</S>, resort<S>6908</S> ye thither unto us: our God<S>430</S> shall fight<S>3898</S> for us.
So we laboured<S>6213</S> in the work<S>4399</S>: and half<S>2677</S> of them held<S>2388</S> the spears<S>7420</S> from the rising<S>5927</S> of the morning<S>7837</S> till the stars<S>3556</S> appeared<S>3318</S>.
Likewise at the same time<S>6256</S> said<S>559</S> I unto the people<S>5971</S>, Let every one<S>376</S> with his servant<S>5288</S> lodge<S>3885</S> within<S>8432</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, that in the night<S>3915</S> they may be a guard<S>4929</S> to us, and labour<S>4399</S> on the day<S>3117</S>.
So neither I, nor my brethren<S>251</S>, nor my servants<S>5288</S>, nor the men<S>582</S> of the guard<S>4929</S> which followed<S>310</S> me, none of us<S>587</S> put off<S>6584</S> our clothes<S>899</S>, saving that every one<S>376</S> put them off<S>7973</S> for washing<S>4325</S>. <sup>saving: or, every one went with his weapon for water</sup>

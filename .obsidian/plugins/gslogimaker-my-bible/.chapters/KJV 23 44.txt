Yet now hear<S>8085</S>, O Jacob<S>3290</S> my servant<S>5650</S>; and Israel<S>3478</S>, whom I have chosen<S>977</S>:
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> that made<S>6213</S> thee, and formed<S>3335</S> thee from the womb<S>990</S>, which will help<S>5826</S> thee; Fear<S>3372</S> not, O Jacob<S>3290</S>, my servant<S>5650</S>; and thou, Jesurun<S>3484</S>, whom I have chosen<S>977</S>.
For I will pour<S>3332</S> water<S>4325</S> upon him that is thirsty<S>6771</S>, and floods<S>5140</S> upon the dry ground<S>3004</S>: I will pour<S>3332</S> my spirit<S>7307</S> upon thy seed<S>2233</S>, and my blessing<S>1293</S> upon thine offspring<S>6631</S>:
And they shall spring up<S>6779</S> as among<S>996</S> the grass<S>2682</S>, as willows<S>6155</S> by the water<S>4325</S> courses<S>2988</S>.
One shall say<S>559</S>, I am the LORD'S<S>3068</S>; and another shall call<S>7121</S> himself by the name<S>8034</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>; and another shall subscribe<S>3789</S> with his hand<S>3027</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and surname<S>3655</S> himself by the name<S>8034</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> the King<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and his redeemer<S>1350</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; I am the first<S>7223</S>, and I am the last<S>314</S>; and beside<S>1107</S> me there is no God<S>430</S>.
And who, as I, shall call<S>7121</S>, and shall declare<S>5046</S> it, and set it in order<S>6186</S> for me, since I appointed<S>7760</S> the ancient<S>5769</S> people<S>5971</S>? and the things that are coming<S>857</S>, and shall come<S>935</S>, let them shew<S>5046</S> unto them.
Fear<S>6342</S> ye not, neither be afraid<S>7297</S> <S>7297</S>: have not I told<S>8085</S> thee from that time<S>227</S>, and have declared<S>5046</S> it? ye are even my witnesses<S>5707</S>. Is there<S>3426</S> a God<S>433</S> beside<S>1107</S> me? yea, there is no God<S>6697</S>; I know<S>3045</S> not any. <sup>God; I: Heb. rock, etc</sup>
They that make<S>3335</S> a graven image<S>6459</S> are all of them vanity<S>8414</S>; and their delectable things<S>2530</S> shall not profit<S>3276</S>; and they are their own witnesses<S>5707</S>; they see<S>7200</S> not, nor know<S>3045</S>; that they may be ashamed<S>954</S>. <sup>delectable: Heb. desirable</sup>
Who hath formed<S>3335</S> a god<S>410</S>, or molten<S>5258</S> a graven image<S>6459</S> that is profitable<S>3276</S> for nothing<S>1115</S>?
Behold, all his fellows<S>2270</S> shall be ashamed<S>954</S>: and the workmen<S>2796</S>, they are of men<S>120</S>: let them all be gathered together<S>6908</S>, let them stand up<S>5975</S>; yet they shall fear<S>6342</S>, and they shall be ashamed<S>954</S> together<S>3162</S>.
The smith<S>1270</S> <S>2796</S> with the tongs<S>4621</S> both worketh<S>6466</S> in the coals<S>6352</S>, and fashioneth<S>3335</S> it with hammers<S>4717</S>, and worketh<S>6466</S> it with the strength<S>3581</S> of his arms<S>2220</S>: yea, he is hungry<S>7457</S>, and his strength<S>3581</S> faileth<S>369</S>: he drinketh<S>8354</S> no water<S>4325</S>, and is faint<S>3286</S>. <sup>with the tongs: or, with an axe</sup>
The carpenter<S>2796</S> <S>6086</S> stretcheth out<S>5186</S> his rule<S>6957</S>; he marketh it out<S>8388</S> with a line<S>8279</S>; he fitteth<S>6213</S> it with planes<S>4741</S>, and he marketh it out<S>8388</S> with the compass<S>4230</S>, and maketh<S>6213</S> it after the figure<S>8403</S> of a man<S>376</S>, according to the beauty<S>8597</S> of a man<S>120</S>; that it may remain<S>3427</S> in the house<S>1004</S>.
He heweth him down<S>3772</S> cedars<S>730</S>, and taketh<S>3947</S> the cypress<S>8645</S> and the oak<S>437</S>, which he strengtheneth<S>553</S> for himself among the trees<S>6086</S> of the forest<S>3293</S>: he planteth<S>5193</S> an ash<S>766</S>, and the rain<S>1653</S> doth nourish<S>1431</S> it. <sup>strengtheneth: or, taketh courage</sup>
Then shall it be for a man<S>120</S> to burn<S>1197</S>: for he will take<S>3947</S> thereof, and warm<S>2552</S> himself; yea, he kindleth<S>5400</S> it, and baketh<S>644</S> bread<S>3899</S>; yea, he maketh<S>6466</S> a god<S>410</S>, and worshippeth<S>7812</S> it; he maketh<S>6213</S> it a graven image<S>6459</S>, and falleth down<S>5456</S> thereto.
He burneth<S>8313</S> part<S>2677</S> thereof in<S>1119</S> the fire<S>784</S>; with part<S>2677</S> thereof he eateth<S>398</S> flesh<S>1320</S>; he roasteth<S>6740</S> roast<S>6748</S>, and is satisfied<S>7646</S>: yea, he warmeth<S>2552</S> himself, and saith<S>559</S>, Aha<S>1889</S>, I am warm<S>2552</S>, I have seen<S>7200</S> the fire<S>217</S>:
And the residue<S>7611</S> thereof he maketh<S>6213</S> a god<S>410</S>, even his graven image<S>6459</S>: he falleth down<S>5456</S> unto it, and worshippeth<S>7812</S> it, and prayeth<S>6419</S> unto it, and saith<S>559</S>, Deliver<S>5337</S> me; for thou art my god<S>410</S>.
They have not known<S>3045</S> nor understood<S>995</S>: for he hath shut<S>2902</S> their eyes<S>5869</S>, that they cannot see<S>7200</S>; and their hearts<S>3826</S>, that they cannot understand<S>7919</S>. <sup>shut: Heb. daubed</sup>
And none considereth<S>7725</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, neither is there knowledge<S>1847</S> nor understanding<S>8394</S> to say<S>559</S>, I have burned<S>8313</S> part<S>2677</S> of it in<S>1119</S> the fire<S>784</S>; yea, also I have baked<S>644</S> bread<S>3899</S> upon the coals<S>1513</S> thereof; I have roasted<S>6740</S> flesh<S>1320</S>, and eaten<S>398</S> it: and shall I make<S>6213</S> the residue<S>3499</S> thereof an abomination<S>8441</S>? shall I fall down<S>5456</S> to the stock<S>944</S> of a tree<S>6086</S>? <sup>considereth: Heb. setteth to his heart</sup> <sup>the stock: Heb. that which comes of a tree?</sup>

Remember<S>2142</S> these, O Jacob<S>3290</S> and Israel<S>3478</S>; for thou art my servant<S>5650</S>: I have formed<S>3335</S> thee; thou art my servant<S>5650</S>: O Israel<S>3478</S>, thou shalt not be forgotten<S>5382</S> of me.
I have blotted out<S>4229</S>, as a thick cloud<S>5645</S>, thy transgressions<S>6588</S>, and, as a cloud<S>6051</S>, thy sins<S>2403</S>: return<S>7725</S> unto me; for I have redeemed<S>1350</S> thee.
Sing<S>7442</S>, O ye heavens<S>8064</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath done<S>6213</S> it: shout<S>7321</S>, ye lower parts<S>8482</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: break forth<S>6476</S> into singing<S>7440</S>, ye mountains<S>2022</S>, O forest<S>3293</S>, and every tree<S>6086</S> therein: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath redeemed<S>1350</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>, and glorified<S>6286</S> himself in Israel<S>3478</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, thy redeemer<S>1350</S>, and he that formed<S>3335</S> thee from the womb<S>990</S>, I am the LORD<S>3068</S> that maketh<S>6213</S> all things; that stretcheth forth<S>5186</S> the heavens<S>8064</S> alone; that spreadeth abroad<S>7554</S> the earth<S>776</S> by myself;
That frustrateth<S>6565</S> the tokens<S>226</S> of the liars<S>907</S>, and maketh diviners<S>7080</S> mad<S>1984</S>; that turneth<S>7725</S> wise<S>2450</S> men backward<S>268</S>, and maketh their knowledge<S>1847</S> foolish<S>5528</S>;
That confirmeth<S>6965</S> the word<S>1697</S> of his servant<S>5650</S>, and performeth<S>7999</S> the counsel<S>6098</S> of his messengers<S>4397</S>; that saith<S>559</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, Thou shalt be inhabited<S>3427</S>; and to the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, Ye shall be built<S>1129</S>, and I will raise up<S>6965</S> the decayed places<S>2723</S> thereof: <sup>decayed: Heb. wastes</sup>

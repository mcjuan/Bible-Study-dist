Now there cried<S>6817</S> a certain<S>259</S> woman<S>802</S> of the wives<S>802</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S> unto Elisha<S>477</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thy servant<S>5650</S> my husband<S>376</S> is dead<S>4191</S>; and thou knowest<S>3045</S> that thy servant<S>5650</S> did fear<S>3373</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and the creditor<S>5383</S> is come<S>935</S> to take<S>3947</S> unto him my two<S>8147</S> sons<S>3206</S> to be bondmen<S>5650</S>.
And Elisha<S>477</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, What shall I do<S>6213</S> for thee? tell<S>5046</S> me, what hast<S>3426</S> thou in the house<S>1004</S>? And she said<S>559</S>, Thine handmaid<S>8198</S> hath not any thing in the house<S>1004</S>, save a pot<S>610</S> of oil<S>8081</S>.
Then he said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, borrow<S>7592</S> thee vessels<S>3627</S> abroad<S>2351</S> of all thy neighbours<S>7934</S>, even empty<S>7386</S> vessels<S>3627</S>; borrow not a few<S>4591</S>. <sup>borrow not: or, scant not</sup>
And when thou art come in<S>935</S>, thou shalt shut<S>5462</S> the door<S>1817</S> upon thee and upon thy sons<S>1121</S>, and shalt pour out<S>3332</S> into all those vessels<S>3627</S>, and thou shalt set aside<S>5265</S> that which is full<S>4392</S>.
So she went<S>3212</S> from him, and shut<S>5462</S> the door<S>1817</S> upon her and upon<S>1157</S> her sons<S>1121</S>, who<S>1992</S> brought<S>5066</S> the vessels to her; and she poured out<S>3332</S>.
And it came to pass, when the vessels<S>3627</S> were full<S>4390</S>, that she said<S>559</S> unto her son<S>1121</S>, Bring<S>5066</S> me yet a vessel<S>3627</S>. And he said<S>559</S> unto her, There is not a vessel<S>3627</S> more. And the oil<S>8081</S> stayed<S>5975</S>.
Then she came<S>935</S> and told<S>5046</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, sell<S>4376</S> the oil<S>8081</S>, and pay<S>7999</S> thy debt<S>5386</S>, and live<S>2421</S> thou and thy children<S>1121</S> of the rest<S>3498</S>. <sup>debt: or, creditor</sup>
And it fell on a day<S>3117</S>, that Elisha<S>477</S> passed<S>5674</S> to Shunem<S>7766</S>, where was a great<S>1419</S> woman<S>802</S>; and she constrained<S>2388</S> him to eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>. And so it was, that as oft<S>1767</S> as he passed by<S>5674</S>, he turned<S>5493</S> in thither to eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>. <sup>it fell on a day: Heb. there was a day</sup> <sup>constrained him: Heb. laid hold on him</sup>
And she said<S>559</S> unto her husband<S>376</S>, Behold now, I perceive<S>3045</S> that this is an holy<S>6918</S> man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, which passeth<S>5674</S> by us continually<S>8548</S>.
Let us make<S>6213</S> a little<S>6996</S> chamber<S>5944</S>, I pray thee, on the wall<S>7023</S>; and let us set<S>7760</S> for him there a bed<S>4296</S>, and a table<S>7979</S>, and a stool<S>3678</S>, and a candlestick<S>4501</S>: and it shall be, when he cometh<S>935</S> to us, that he shall turn<S>5493</S> in thither.
And it fell on a day<S>3117</S>, that he came<S>935</S> thither, and he turned<S>5493</S> into the chamber<S>5944</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> there.
And he said<S>559</S> to Gehazi<S>1522</S> his servant<S>5288</S>, Call<S>7121</S> this Shunammite<S>7767</S>. And when he had called<S>7121</S> her, she stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him.
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Say<S>559</S> now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful<S>2729</S> for us with all this care<S>2731</S>; what is to be done<S>6213</S> for thee? wouldest<S>3426</S> thou be spoken<S>1696</S> for to the king<S>4428</S>, or to the captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S>? And she answered<S>559</S>, I dwell<S>3427</S> among<S>8432</S> mine own people<S>5971</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, What then is to be done<S>6213</S> for her? And Gehazi<S>1522</S> answered<S>559</S>, Verily<S>61</S> she hath no child<S>1121</S>, and her husband<S>376</S> is old<S>2204</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Call<S>7121</S> her. And when he had called<S>7121</S> her, she stood<S>5975</S> in the door<S>6607</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, About this season<S>4150</S>, according to the time<S>6256</S> of life<S>2416</S>, thou shalt embrace<S>2263</S> a son<S>1121</S>. And she said<S>559</S>, Nay, my lord<S>113</S>, thou man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, do not lie<S>3576</S> unto thine handmaid<S>8198</S>. <sup>season: Heb. set time</sup>
And the woman<S>802</S> conceived<S>2029</S>, and bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S> at that season<S>4150</S> that Elisha<S>477</S> had said<S>1696</S> unto her, according to the time<S>6256</S> of life<S>2416</S>.
And when the child<S>3206</S> was grown<S>1431</S>, it fell on a day<S>3117</S>, that he went out<S>3318</S> to his father<S>1</S> to the reapers<S>7114</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, My head<S>7218</S>, my head<S>7218</S>. And he said<S>559</S> to a lad<S>5288</S>, Carry<S>5375</S> him to his mother<S>517</S>.
And when he had taken<S>5375</S> him, and brought<S>935</S> him to his mother<S>517</S>, he sat<S>3427</S> on her knees<S>1290</S> till noon<S>6672</S>, and then died<S>4191</S>.
And she went up<S>5927</S>, and laid<S>7901</S> him on the bed<S>4296</S> of the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, and shut<S>5462</S> the door upon him, and went out<S>3318</S>.
And she called<S>7121</S> unto her husband<S>376</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Send<S>7971</S> me, I pray thee, one<S>259</S> of the young men<S>5288</S>, and one<S>259</S> of the asses<S>860</S>, that I may run<S>7323</S> to the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, and come again<S>7725</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Wherefore wilt thou go<S>1980</S> to him to day<S>3117</S>? it is neither new moon<S>2320</S>, nor sabbath<S>7676</S>. And she said<S>559</S>, It shall be well<S>7965</S>. <sup>well: Heb. peace</sup>
Then she saddled<S>2280</S> an ass<S>860</S>, and said<S>559</S> to her servant<S>5288</S>, Drive<S>5090</S>, and go forward<S>3212</S>; slack<S>6113</S> not thy riding<S>7392</S> for me, except I bid<S>559</S> thee. <sup>slack: Heb. restrain not for me to ride</sup>
So she went<S>3212</S> and came<S>935</S> unto the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> to mount<S>2022</S> Carmel<S>3760</S>. And it came to pass, when the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> saw her afar off<S>7200</S>, that he said<S>559</S> to Gehazi<S>1522</S> his servant<S>5288</S>, Behold, yonder is that<S>1975</S> Shunammite<S>7767</S>:
Run<S>7323</S> now, I pray thee, to meet<S>7125</S> her, and say<S>559</S> unto her, Is it well<S>7965</S> with thee? is it well<S>7965</S> with thy husband<S>376</S>? is it well<S>7965</S> with the child<S>3206</S>? And she answered<S>559</S>, It is well<S>7965</S>.
And when she came<S>935</S> to the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> to the hill<S>2022</S>, she caught<S>2388</S> him by the feet<S>7272</S>: but Gehazi<S>1522</S> came near<S>5066</S> to thrust her away<S>1920</S>. And the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, Let her alone<S>7503</S>; for her soul<S>5315</S> is vexed<S>4843</S> within her: and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath hid<S>5956</S> it from me, and hath not told<S>5046</S> me. <sup>him: Heb. by his feet</sup> <sup>vexed: Heb. bitter</sup>
Then she said<S>559</S>, Did I desire<S>7592</S> a son<S>1121</S> of my lord<S>113</S>? did I not say<S>559</S>, Do not deceive<S>7952</S> me?
Then he said<S>559</S> to Gehazi<S>1522</S>, Gird up<S>2296</S> thy loins<S>4975</S>, and take<S>3947</S> my staff<S>4938</S> in thine hand<S>3027</S>, and go thy way<S>3212</S>: if thou meet<S>4672</S> any man<S>376</S>, salute<S>1288</S> him not; and if any<S>376</S> salute<S>1288</S> thee, answer him not again<S>6030</S>: and lay<S>7760</S> my staff<S>4938</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the child<S>5288</S>.
And the mother<S>517</S> of the child<S>5288</S> said<S>559</S>, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, and as thy soul<S>5315</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, I will not leave<S>5800</S> thee. And he arose<S>6965</S>, and followed<S>3212</S> <S>310</S> her.
And Gehazi<S>1522</S> passed on<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> them, and laid<S>7760</S> the staff<S>4938</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the child<S>5288</S>; but there was neither voice<S>6963</S>, nor hearing<S>7182</S>. Wherefore he went again<S>7725</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him, and told<S>5046</S> him, saying<S>559</S>, The child<S>5288</S> is not awaked<S>6974</S>. <sup>hearing: Heb. attention</sup>
And when Elisha<S>477</S> was come<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S>, behold, the child<S>5288</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, and laid<S>7901</S> upon his bed<S>4296</S>.
He went in<S>935</S> therefore, and shut<S>5462</S> the door<S>1817</S> upon them twain<S>8147</S>, and prayed<S>6419</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And he went up<S>5927</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> upon the child<S>3206</S>, and put<S>7760</S> his mouth<S>6310</S> upon his mouth<S>6310</S>, and his eyes<S>5869</S> upon his eyes<S>5869</S>, and his hands<S>3709</S> upon his hands<S>3709</S>: and he stretched<S>1457</S> himself upon the child; and the flesh<S>1320</S> of the child<S>3206</S> waxed warm<S>2552</S>.
Then he returned<S>7725</S>, and walked<S>3212</S> in the house<S>1004</S> to<S>259</S> <S>2008</S> and fro<S>259</S> <S>2008</S>; and went up<S>5927</S>, and stretched<S>1457</S> himself upon him: and the child<S>5288</S> sneezed<S>2237</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>, and the child<S>5288</S> opened<S>6491</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>. <sup>to and fro: Heb. once hither and once thither</sup>
And he called<S>7121</S> Gehazi<S>1522</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Call<S>7121</S> this Shunammite<S>7767</S>. So he called<S>7121</S> her. And when she was come in<S>935</S> unto him, he said<S>559</S>, Take up<S>5375</S> thy son<S>1121</S>.
Then she went in<S>935</S>, and fell<S>5307</S> at his feet<S>7272</S>, and bowed<S>7812</S> herself to the ground<S>776</S>, and took up<S>5375</S> her son<S>1121</S>, and went out<S>3318</S>.
And Elisha<S>477</S> came again<S>7725</S> to Gilgal<S>1537</S>: and there was a dearth<S>7458</S> in the land<S>776</S>; and the sons<S>1121</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S> were sitting<S>3427</S> before<S>6440</S> him: and he said<S>559</S> unto his servant<S>5288</S>, Set<S>8239</S> on the great<S>1419</S> pot<S>5518</S>, and seethe<S>1310</S> pottage<S>5138</S> for the sons<S>1121</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S>.
And one<S>259</S> went out<S>3318</S> into the field<S>7704</S> to gather<S>3950</S> herbs<S>219</S>, and found<S>4672</S> a wild<S>7704</S> vine<S>1612</S>, and gathered<S>3950</S> thereof wild<S>7704</S> gourds<S>6498</S> his lap<S>899</S> full<S>4393</S>, and came<S>935</S> and shred<S>6398</S> them into the pot<S>5518</S> of pottage<S>5138</S>: for they knew<S>3045</S> them not.
So they poured out<S>3332</S> for the men<S>582</S> to eat<S>398</S>. And it came to pass, as they were eating<S>398</S> of the pottage<S>5138</S>, that they cried out<S>6817</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O thou man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, there is death<S>4194</S> in the pot<S>5518</S>. And they could<S>3201</S> not eat<S>398</S> thereof.
But he said<S>559</S>, Then bring<S>3947</S> meal<S>7058</S>. And he cast<S>7993</S> it into the pot<S>5518</S>; and he said<S>559</S>, Pour out<S>3332</S> for the people<S>5971</S>, that they may eat<S>398</S>. And there was no harm<S>1697</S> <S>7451</S> in the pot<S>5518</S>. <sup>harm: Heb. evil thing</sup>
And there came<S>935</S> a man<S>376</S> from Baalshalisha<S>1190</S>, and brought<S>935</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> bread<S>3899</S> of the firstfruits<S>1061</S>, twenty<S>6242</S> loaves<S>3899</S> of barley<S>8184</S>, and full ears of corn<S>3759</S> in the husk<S>6861</S> thereof. And he said<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, that they may eat<S>398</S>. <sup>the husk: or, his scrip, or, garment</sup>
And his servitor<S>8334</S> said<S>559</S>, What, should I set<S>5414</S> this before<S>6440</S> an hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S>? He said again<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> the people<S>5971</S>, that they may eat<S>398</S>: for thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, They shall eat<S>398</S>, and shall leave<S>3498</S> thereof.
So he set<S>5414</S> it before<S>6440</S> them, and they did eat<S>398</S>, and left<S>3498</S> thereof, according to the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.

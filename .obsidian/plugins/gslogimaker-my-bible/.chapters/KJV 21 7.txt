A good name<S>8034</S> is better<S>2896</S> than precious<S>2896</S> ointment<S>8081</S>; and the day<S>3117</S> of death<S>4194</S> than the day<S>3117</S> of one's birth<S>3205</S>.
It is better<S>2896</S> to go<S>3212</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of mourning<S>60</S>, than to go<S>3212</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of feasting<S>4960</S>: for<S>834</S> that is the end<S>5490</S> of all men<S>120</S>; and the living<S>2416</S> will lay<S>5414</S> it to his heart<S>3820</S>.
Sorrow<S>3708</S> is better<S>2896</S> than laughter<S>7814</S>: for by the sadness<S>7455</S> of the countenance<S>6440</S> the heart<S>3820</S> is made better<S>3190</S>. <sup>Sorrow: or, Anger</sup>
The heart<S>3820</S> of the wise<S>2450</S> is in the house<S>1004</S> of mourning<S>60</S>; but the heart<S>3820</S> of fools<S>3684</S> is in the house<S>1004</S> of mirth<S>8057</S>.
It is better<S>2896</S> to hear<S>8085</S> the rebuke<S>1606</S> of the wise<S>2450</S>, than for a man<S>376</S> to hear<S>8085</S> the song<S>7892</S> of fools<S>3684</S>.
For as the crackling<S>6963</S> of thorns<S>5518</S> under a pot<S>5518</S>, so is the laughter<S>7814</S> of the fool<S>3684</S>: this also is vanity<S>1892</S>. <sup>crackling: Heb. sound</sup>
Surely oppression<S>6233</S> maketh a wise man<S>2450</S> mad<S>1984</S>; and a gift<S>4979</S> destroyeth<S>6</S> the heart<S>3820</S>.
Better<S>2896</S> is the end<S>319</S> of a thing<S>1697</S> than the beginning<S>7225</S> thereof: and the patient<S>750</S> in spirit<S>7307</S> is better<S>2896</S> than the proud<S>1362</S> in spirit<S>7307</S>.
Be not hasty<S>926</S> in thy spirit<S>7307</S> to be angry<S>3707</S>: for anger<S>3708</S> resteth<S>5117</S> in the bosom<S>2436</S> of fools<S>3684</S>.
Say<S>559</S> not thou, What is the cause that the former<S>7223</S> days<S>3117</S> were better<S>2896</S> than these? for thou dost not enquire<S>7592</S> wisely<S>2451</S> concerning this. <sup>wisely: Heb. out of wisdom</sup>
Wisdom<S>2451</S> is good<S>2896</S> with an inheritance<S>5159</S>: and by it there is profit<S>3148</S> to them that see<S>7200</S> the sun<S>8121</S>. <sup>good: or, as good as an inheritance, yea, better too</sup>
For wisdom<S>2451</S> is a defence<S>6738</S>, and money<S>3701</S> is a defence<S>6738</S>: but the excellency<S>3504</S> of knowledge<S>1847</S> is, that wisdom<S>2451</S> giveth life<S>2421</S> to them that have<S>1167</S> it. <sup>defence: Heb. shadow</sup>
Consider<S>7200</S> the work<S>4639</S> of God<S>430</S>: for who can<S>3201</S> make that straight<S>8626</S>, which he hath made crooked<S>5791</S>?
In the day<S>3117</S> of prosperity<S>2896</S> be joyful<S>2896</S>, but in the day<S>3117</S> of adversity<S>7451</S> consider<S>7200</S>: God<S>430</S> also hath set<S>6213</S> the one over against<S>5980</S> the other, to the end<S>1700</S> that man<S>120</S> should find<S>4672</S> nothing<S>3972</S> after<S>310</S> him. <sup>set: Heb. made</sup>
All things have I seen<S>7200</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of my vanity<S>1892</S>: there is<S>3426</S> a just<S>6662</S> man that perisheth<S>6</S> in his righteousness<S>6664</S>, and there is a wicked<S>7563</S> man that prolongeth<S>748</S> his life in his wickedness<S>7451</S>.
Be not righteous<S>6662</S> over much<S>7235</S>; neither make thyself over<S>3148</S> wise<S>2449</S>: why shouldest thou destroy<S>8074</S> thyself? <sup>destroy: Heb. be desolate?</sup>
Be not over much<S>7235</S> wicked<S>7561</S>, neither be thou foolish<S>5530</S>: why shouldest thou die<S>4191</S> before thy time<S>6256</S>? <sup>before: Heb. not in thy time?</sup>
It is good<S>2896</S> that thou shouldest take hold<S>270</S> of this; yea, also from this<S>2088</S> withdraw<S>3240</S> not thine hand<S>3027</S>: for he that feareth<S>3373</S> God<S>430</S> shall come forth<S>3318</S> of them all.
Wisdom<S>2451</S> strengtheneth<S>5810</S> the wise<S>2450</S> more than ten<S>6235</S> mighty<S>7989</S> men which are in the city<S>5892</S>.
For there is not a just<S>6662</S> man<S>120</S> upon earth<S>776</S>, that doeth<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>, and sinneth<S>2398</S> not.
Also take<S>5414</S> no heed<S>3820</S> unto all words<S>1697</S> that are spoken<S>1696</S>; lest thou hear<S>8085</S> thy servant<S>5650</S> curse<S>7043</S> thee: <sup>take: Heb. give not thine heart</sup>
For oftentimes<S>6471</S> <S>7227</S> also thine own heart<S>3820</S> knoweth<S>3045</S> that thou thyself likewise hast cursed<S>7043</S> others<S>312</S>.
All this<S>2090</S> have I proved<S>5254</S> by wisdom<S>2451</S>: I said<S>559</S>, I will be wise<S>2449</S>; but it was far<S>7350</S> from me.
That which is far off<S>7350</S>, and exceeding deep<S>6013</S>, who can find it out<S>4672</S>?
I applied<S>5437</S> mine heart<S>3820</S> to know<S>3045</S>, and to search<S>8446</S>, and to seek out<S>1245</S> wisdom<S>2451</S>, and the reason<S>2808</S> of things, and to know<S>3045</S> the wickedness<S>7562</S> of folly<S>3689</S>, even of foolishness<S>5531</S> and madness<S>1947</S>: <sup>I applied: Heb. I and mine heart compassed</sup>
And I find<S>4672</S> more bitter<S>4751</S> than death<S>4194</S> the woman<S>802</S>, whose heart<S>3820</S> is snares<S>4685</S> and nets<S>2764</S>, and her hands<S>3027</S> as bands<S>612</S>: whoso pleaseth<S>2896</S> <S>6440</S> God<S>430</S> shall escape<S>4422</S> from her; but the sinner<S>2398</S> shall be taken<S>3920</S> by her. <sup>whoso: Heb. he that is good before God</sup>
Behold<S>7200</S>, this have I found<S>4672</S>, saith<S>559</S> the preacher<S>6953</S>, counting one<S>259</S> by one<S>259</S>, to find out<S>4672</S> the account<S>2808</S>: <sup>counting: or, weighing one thing after another, to find out the reason</sup>
Which yet my soul<S>5315</S> seeketh<S>1245</S>, but I find<S>4672</S> not: one<S>259</S> man<S>120</S> among a thousand<S>505</S> have I found<S>4672</S>; but a woman<S>802</S> among all those have I not found<S>4672</S>.
Lo<S>7200</S>, this only<S>905</S> have I found<S>4672</S>, that God<S>430</S> hath made<S>6213</S> man<S>120</S> upright<S>3477</S>; but they have sought out<S>1245</S> many<S>7227</S> inventions<S>2810</S>.

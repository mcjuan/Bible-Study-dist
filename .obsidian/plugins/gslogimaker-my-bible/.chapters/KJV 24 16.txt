The word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came also unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Thou shalt not take<S>3947</S> thee a wife<S>802</S>, neither shalt thou have sons<S>1121</S> or daughters<S>1323</S> in this place<S>4725</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> concerning the sons<S>1121</S> and concerning the daughters<S>1323</S> that are born<S>3205</S> in this place<S>4725</S>, and concerning their mothers<S>517</S> that bare<S>3205</S> them, and concerning their fathers<S>1</S> that begat<S>3209</S> them in this land<S>776</S>;
They shall die<S>4191</S> of grievous<S>8463</S> deaths<S>4463</S>; they shall not be lamented<S>5594</S>; neither shall they be buried<S>6912</S>; but they shall be as dung<S>1828</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>: and they shall be consumed<S>3615</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>, and by famine<S>7458</S>; and their carcases<S>5038</S> shall be meat<S>3978</S> for the fowls<S>5775</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and for the beasts<S>929</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Enter<S>935</S> not into the house<S>1004</S> of mourning<S>4798</S>, neither go<S>3212</S> to lament<S>5594</S> nor bemoan<S>5110</S> them: for I have taken away<S>622</S> my peace<S>7965</S> from this people<S>5971</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, even lovingkindness<S>2617</S> and mercies<S>7356</S>. <sup>mourning: or, mourning feast</sup>
Both the great<S>1419</S> and the small<S>6996</S> shall die<S>4191</S> in this land<S>776</S>: they shall not be buried<S>6912</S>, neither shall men lament<S>5594</S> for them, nor cut<S>1413</S> themselves, nor make themselves bald<S>7139</S> for them:
Neither shall men tear<S>6536</S> themselves for them in mourning<S>60</S>, to comfort<S>5162</S> them for the dead<S>4191</S>; neither shall men give them the cup<S>3563</S> of consolation<S>8575</S> to drink<S>8248</S> for their father<S>1</S> or for their mother<S>517</S>. <sup>tear: or, break bread for them</sup>
Thou shalt not also go<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of feasting<S>4960</S>, to sit<S>3427</S> with them to eat<S>398</S> and to drink<S>8354</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Behold, I will cause to cease<S>7673</S> out of this place<S>4725</S> in your eyes<S>5869</S>, and in your days<S>3117</S>, the voice<S>6963</S> of mirth<S>8342</S>, and the voice<S>6963</S> of gladness<S>8057</S>, the voice<S>6963</S> of the bridegroom<S>2860</S>, and the voice<S>6963</S> of the bride<S>3618</S>.
And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew<S>5046</S> this people<S>5971</S> all these words<S>1697</S>, and they shall say<S>559</S> unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD<S>3068</S> pronounced<S>1696</S> all this great<S>1419</S> evil<S>7451</S> against us? or what is our iniquity<S>5771</S>? or what is our sin<S>2403</S> that we have committed<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>?
Then shalt thou say<S>559</S> unto them, Because your fathers<S>1</S> have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and have walked<S>3212</S> after<S>310</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, and have served<S>5647</S> them, and have worshipped<S>7812</S> them, and have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and have not kept<S>8104</S> my law<S>8451</S>;
And ye have done<S>6213</S> worse<S>7489</S> than your fathers<S>1</S>; for, behold<S>2009</S>, ye walk<S>1980</S> every one<S>376</S> after<S>310</S> the imagination<S>8307</S> of his evil<S>7451</S> heart<S>3820</S>, that they may not hearken<S>8085</S> unto me: <sup>imagination: or, stubbornness</sup>
Therefore will I cast<S>2904</S> you out of this land<S>776</S> into a land<S>776</S> that ye know<S>3045</S> not, neither ye nor your fathers<S>1</S>; and there shall ye serve<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S> day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S>; where I will not shew<S>5414</S> you favour<S>2594</S>.
Therefore, behold, the days<S>3117</S> come<S>935</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that it shall no more be said<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, that brought up<S>5927</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>;
But, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, that brought up<S>5927</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> from the land<S>776</S> of the north<S>6828</S>, and from all the lands<S>776</S> whither he had driven<S>5080</S> them: and I will bring them again<S>7725</S> into their land<S>127</S> that I gave<S>5414</S> unto their fathers<S>1</S>.
Behold, I will send<S>7971</S> for many<S>7227</S> fishers<S>1771</S> <S>1728</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and they shall fish<S>1770</S> them; and after<S>310</S> will I send<S>7971</S> for many<S>7227</S> hunters<S>6719</S>, and they shall hunt<S>6679</S> them from every mountain<S>2022</S>, and from every hill<S>1389</S>, and out of the holes<S>5357</S> of the rocks<S>5553</S>.
For mine eyes<S>5869</S> are upon all their ways<S>1870</S>: they are not hid<S>5641</S> from my face<S>6440</S>, neither is their iniquity<S>5771</S> hid<S>6845</S> from<S>5048</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>.
And first<S>7223</S> I will recompense<S>7999</S> their iniquity<S>5771</S> and their sin<S>2403</S> double<S>4932</S>; because they have defiled<S>2490</S> my land<S>776</S>, they have filled<S>4390</S> mine inheritance<S>5159</S> with the carcases<S>5038</S> of their detestable<S>8251</S> and abominable things<S>8441</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, my strength<S>5797</S>, and my fortress<S>4581</S>, and my refuge<S>4498</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of affliction<S>6869</S>, the Gentiles<S>1471</S> shall come<S>935</S> unto thee from the ends<S>657</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and shall say<S>559</S>, Surely our fathers<S>1</S> have inherited<S>5157</S> lies<S>8267</S>, vanity<S>1892</S>, and things wherein there is no profit<S>3276</S>.
Shall a man<S>120</S> make<S>6213</S> gods<S>430</S> unto himself, and they are no gods<S>430</S>?
Therefore, behold, I will this once<S>6471</S> cause them to know<S>3045</S>, I will cause them to know<S>3045</S> mine hand<S>3027</S> and my might<S>1369</S>; and they shall know<S>3045</S> that my name<S>8034</S> is The LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>The LORD: or, JEHOVAH</sup>

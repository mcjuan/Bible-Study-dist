The word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> which came to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> against the Gentiles<S>1471</S>;
Against Egypt<S>4714</S>, against the army<S>2428</S> of Pharaohnecho<S>6549</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, which was by the river<S>5104</S> Euphrates<S>6578</S> in Carchemish<S>3751</S>, which Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> smote<S>5221</S> in the fourth<S>7243</S> year<S>8141</S> of Jehoiakim<S>3079</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Josiah<S>2977</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
Order<S>6186</S> ye the buckler<S>4043</S> and shield<S>6793</S>, and draw near<S>5066</S> to battle<S>4421</S>.
Harness<S>631</S> the horses<S>5483</S>; and get up<S>5927</S>, ye horsemen<S>6571</S>, and stand forth<S>3320</S> with your helmets<S>3553</S>; furbish<S>4838</S> the spears<S>7420</S>, and put on<S>3847</S> the brigandines<S>5630</S>.
Wherefore have I seen<S>7200</S> them dismayed<S>2844</S> and turned<S>5472</S> away back<S>268</S>? and their mighty ones<S>1368</S> are beaten down<S>3807</S>, and are fled<S>5127</S> apace<S>4498</S>, and look not back<S>6437</S>: for fear<S>4032</S> was round about<S>5439</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>beaten: Heb. broken in pieces</sup> <sup>fled: Heb. fled a flight</sup>
Let not the swift<S>7031</S> flee away<S>5127</S>, nor the mighty man<S>1368</S> escape<S>4422</S>; they shall stumble<S>3782</S>, and fall<S>5307</S> toward the north<S>6828</S> by<S>3027</S> the river<S>5104</S> Euphrates<S>6578</S>.
Who is this that cometh up<S>5927</S> as a flood<S>2975</S>, whose waters<S>4325</S> are moved<S>1607</S> as the rivers<S>5104</S>?
Egypt<S>4714</S> riseth up<S>5927</S> like a flood<S>2975</S>, and his waters<S>4325</S> are moved<S>1607</S> like the rivers<S>5104</S>; and he saith<S>559</S>, I will go up<S>5927</S>, and will cover<S>3680</S> the earth<S>776</S>; I will destroy<S>6</S> the city<S>5892</S> and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof.
Come up<S>5927</S>, ye horses<S>5483</S>; and rage<S>1984</S>, ye chariots<S>7393</S>; and let the mighty men<S>1368</S> come forth<S>3318</S>; the Ethiopians<S>3568</S> and the Libyans<S>6316</S>, that handle<S>8610</S> the shield<S>4043</S>; and the Lydians<S>3866</S>, that handle<S>8610</S> and bend<S>1869</S> the bow<S>7198</S>. <sup>the Ethiopians: Heb.

The word<S>1697</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, how Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> should come<S>935</S> and smite<S>5221</S> the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Declare<S>5046</S> ye in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and publish<S>8085</S> in Migdol<S>4024</S>, and publish<S>8085</S> in Noph<S>5297</S> and in Tahpanhes<S>8471</S>: say<S>559</S> ye, Stand fast<S>3320</S>, and prepare<S>3559</S> thee; for the sword<S>2719</S> shall devour<S>398</S> round about<S>5439</S> thee.
Why are thy valiant<S>47</S> men swept away<S>5502</S>? they stood<S>5975</S> not, because the LORD<S>3068</S> did drive<S>1920</S> them.
He made many<S>7235</S> to fall<S>3782</S>, yea, one<S>376</S> fell<S>5307</S> upon another<S>7453</S>: and they said<S>559</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, and let us go again<S>7725</S> to our own people<S>5971</S>, and to the land<S>776</S> of our nativity<S>4138</S>, from<S>6440</S> the oppressing<S>3238</S> sword<S>2719</S>. <sup>made: Heb. multiplied the faller</sup>

As I live<S>2416</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the King<S>4428</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> is the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, Surely as Tabor<S>8396</S> is among the mountains<S>2022</S>, and as Carmel<S>3760</S> by the sea<S>3220</S>, so shall he come<S>935</S>.

The LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saith<S>559</S>; Behold, I will punish<S>6485</S> the multitude<S>527</S> <S>528</S> of No<S>4996</S>, and Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and Egypt<S>4714</S>, with their gods<S>430</S>, and their kings<S>4428</S>; even Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and all them that trust<S>982</S> in him: <sup>multitude: or, nourisher: Heb.

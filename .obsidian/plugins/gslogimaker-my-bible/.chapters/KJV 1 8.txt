And God<S>430</S> remembered<S>2142</S> Noah<S>5146</S>, and every living thing<S>2416</S>, and all the cattle<S>929</S> that was with him in the ark<S>8392</S>: and God<S>430</S> made<S>5674</S> a wind<S>7307</S> to pass<S>5674</S> over<S>5921</S> the earth<S>776</S>, and the waters<S>4325</S> asswaged<S>7918</S>;
The fountains<S>4599</S> also of the deep<S>8415</S> and the windows<S>699</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> were stopped<S>5534</S>, and the rain<S>1653</S> from heaven<S>8064</S> was restrained<S>3607</S>;
And the waters<S>4325</S> returned<S>7725</S> from off the earth<S>776</S> continually<S>1980</S> <S>7725</S>: and after the end<S>7097</S> of the hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> days<S>3117</S> the waters<S>4325</S> were abated<S>2637</S>. <sup>continually: Heb. in going and returning</sup>
And the ark<S>8392</S> rested<S>5117</S> in the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the seventeenth<S>6240</S> <S>7651</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S>, upon the mountains<S>2022</S> of Ararat<S>780</S>.
And the waters<S>4325</S> decreased<S>2637</S> continually<S>1980</S> until<S>5704</S> the tenth<S>6224</S> month<S>2320</S>: in the tenth<S>6224</S> month, on the first<S>259</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, were the tops<S>7218</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S> seen<S>7200</S>. <sup>decreased: Heb. were in going and decreasing</sup>
And it came to pass at the end<S>7093</S> of forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S>, that Noah<S>5146</S> opened<S>6605</S> the window<S>2474</S> of the ark<S>8392</S> which he had made<S>6213</S>:
And he sent forth<S>7971</S> a raven<S>6158</S>, which went forth<S>3318</S> to<S>3318</S> and fro<S>7725</S>, until the waters<S>4325</S> were dried up<S>3001</S> from off the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>to: Heb. in going forth and returning</sup>
Also he sent forth<S>7971</S> a dove<S>3123</S> from him, to see<S>7200</S> if the waters<S>4325</S> were abated<S>7043</S> from off the face<S>6440</S> of the ground<S>127</S>;
But the dove<S>3123</S> found<S>4672</S> no rest<S>4494</S> for the sole<S>3709</S> of her foot<S>7272</S>, and she returned<S>7725</S> unto him into the ark<S>8392</S>, for the waters<S>4325</S> were on the face<S>6440</S> of the whole earth<S>776</S>: then he put forth<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, and took her<S>3947</S>, and pulled her in<S>935</S> unto him into the ark<S>8392</S>. <sup>pulled: Heb. caused her to come</sup>
And he stayed<S>2342</S> yet other<S>312</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>; and again<S>3254</S> he sent forth<S>7971</S> the dove<S>3123</S> out of the ark<S>8392</S>;
And the dove<S>3123</S> came in<S>935</S> to him in the evening<S>6256</S> <S>6153</S>; and, lo, in her mouth<S>6310</S> was an olive<S>2132</S> leaf<S>5929</S> pluckt off<S>2965</S>: so Noah<S>5146</S> knew<S>3045</S> that the waters<S>4325</S> were abated<S>7043</S> from off the earth<S>776</S>.
And he stayed<S>3176</S> yet other<S>312</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>; and sent forth<S>7971</S> the dove<S>3123</S>; which returned<S>7725</S> not again<S>3254</S> unto him any more<S>5750</S>.
And it came to pass in the six<S>8337</S> hundredth<S>3967</S> and first year<S>8141</S>, in the first<S>7223</S> month, the first<S>259</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, the waters<S>4325</S> were dried up<S>2717</S> from off the earth<S>776</S>: and Noah<S>5146</S> removed<S>5493</S> the covering<S>4372</S> of the ark<S>8392</S>, and looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, the face<S>6440</S> of the ground<S>127</S> was dry<S>2717</S>.
And in the second<S>8145</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the seven<S>7651</S> and twentieth<S>6242</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S>, was the earth<S>776</S> dried<S>3001</S>.
And God<S>430</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Go forth<S>3318</S> of the ark<S>8392</S>, thou, and thy wife<S>802</S>, and thy sons<S>1121</S>, and thy sons'<S>1121</S> wives<S>802</S> with thee.
Bring forth<S>3318</S> with thee every living thing<S>2416</S> that is with thee, of all flesh<S>1320</S>, both of fowl<S>5775</S>, and of cattle<S>929</S>, and of every creeping thing<S>7431</S> that creepeth<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>; that they may breed abundantly<S>8317</S> in the earth<S>776</S>, and be fruitful<S>6509</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>.
And Noah<S>5146</S> went forth<S>3318</S>, and his sons<S>1121</S>, and his wife<S>802</S>, and his sons'<S>1121</S> wives<S>802</S> with him:
Every beast<S>2416</S>, every creeping thing<S>7431</S>, and every fowl<S>5775</S>, and whatsoever<S>3605</S> creepeth<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>, after their kinds<S>4940</S>, went forth<S>3318</S> out of the ark<S>8392</S>. <sup>kinds: Heb. families</sup>
And Noah<S>5146</S> builded<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; and took<S>3947</S> of every clean<S>2889</S> beast<S>929</S>, and of every clean<S>2889</S> fowl<S>5775</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> on the altar<S>4196</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> smelled<S>7306</S> a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> in<S>413</S> his heart<S>3820</S>, I will not again<S>3254</S> curse<S>7043</S> the ground<S>127</S> any more for man's<S>120</S> sake<S>5668</S>; for the imagination<S>3336</S> of man's<S>120</S> heart<S>3820</S> is evil<S>7451</S> from his youth<S>5271</S>; neither will I again<S>3254</S> smite<S>5221</S> any more every thing living<S>2416</S>, as I have done<S>6213</S>. <sup>a sweet: Heb. a savour of rest or, satisfaction</sup> <sup>for the imagination: or, through the imagination</sup>

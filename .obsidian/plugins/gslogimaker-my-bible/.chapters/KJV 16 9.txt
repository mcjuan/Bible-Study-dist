Now in the twenty<S>6242</S> and fourth<S>702</S> day<S>3117</S> of this month<S>2320</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were assembled<S>622</S> with fasting<S>6685</S>, and with sackclothes<S>8242</S>, and earth<S>127</S> upon them.
And the seed<S>2233</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> separated<S>914</S> themselves from all strangers<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> and confessed<S>3034</S> their sins<S>2403</S>, and the iniquities<S>5771</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>. <sup>strangers: Heb. strange children</sup>
And they stood up<S>6965</S> in their place<S>5977</S>, and read<S>7121</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S> one fourth part<S>7243</S> of the day<S>3117</S>; and another fourth part<S>7243</S> they confessed<S>3034</S>, and worshipped<S>7812</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>.
Then stood up<S>6965</S> upon the stairs<S>4608</S>, of the Levites<S>3881</S>, Jeshua<S>3442</S>, and Bani<S>1137</S>, Kadmiel<S>6934</S>, Shebaniah<S>7645</S>, Bunni<S>1138</S>, Sherebiah<S>8274</S>, Bani<S>1137</S>, and Chenani<S>3662</S>, and cried<S>2199</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>. <sup>stairs: or, scaffold</sup>
Then the Levites<S>3881</S>, Jeshua<S>3442</S>, and Kadmiel<S>6934</S>, Bani<S>1137</S>, Hashabniah<S>2813</S>, Sherebiah<S>8274</S>, Hodijah<S>1941</S>, Shebaniah<S>7645</S>, and Pethahiah<S>6611</S>, said<S>559</S>, Stand up<S>6965</S> and bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> for ever<S>5769</S> and ever<S>5769</S>: and blessed<S>1288</S> be thy glorious<S>3519</S> name<S>8034</S>, which is exalted<S>7311</S> above all blessing<S>1293</S> and praise<S>8416</S>.
Thou, even thou, art LORD<S>3068</S> alone; thou hast made<S>6213</S> heaven<S>8064</S>, the heaven<S>8064</S> of heavens<S>8064</S>, with all their host<S>6635</S>, the earth<S>776</S>, and all things that are therein, the seas<S>3220</S>, and all that is therein, and thou preservest<S>2421</S> them all; and the host<S>6635</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> worshippeth<S>7812</S> thee.
Thou art the LORD<S>3068</S> the God<S>430</S>, who didst choose<S>977</S> Abram<S>87</S>, and broughtest him forth<S>3318</S> out of Ur<S>218</S> of the Chaldees<S>3778</S>, and gavest<S>7760</S> him the name<S>8034</S> of Abraham<S>85</S>;
And foundest<S>4672</S> his heart<S>3824</S> faithful<S>539</S> before<S>6440</S> thee, and madest<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with him to give<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> of the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, the Hittites<S>2850</S>, the Amorites<S>567</S>, and the Perizzites<S>6522</S>, and the Jebusites<S>2983</S>, and the Girgashites<S>1622</S>, to give<S>5414</S> it, I say, to his seed<S>2233</S>, and hast performed<S>6965</S> thy words<S>1697</S>; for thou art righteous<S>6662</S>:
And didst see<S>7200</S> the affliction<S>6040</S> of our fathers<S>1</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and heardest<S>8085</S> their cry<S>2201</S> by the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>;
And shewedst<S>5414</S> signs<S>226</S> and wonders<S>4159</S> upon Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and on all his servants<S>5650</S>, and on all the people<S>5971</S> of his land<S>776</S>: for thou knewest<S>3045</S> that they dealt proudly<S>2102</S> against them. So didst thou get<S>6213</S> thee a name<S>8034</S>, as it is this day<S>3117</S>.
And thou didst divide<S>1234</S> the sea<S>3220</S> before<S>6440</S> them, so that they went through<S>5674</S> the midst<S>8432</S> of the sea<S>3220</S> on the dry land<S>3004</S>; and their persecutors<S>7291</S> thou threwest<S>7993</S> into the deeps<S>4688</S>, as a stone<S>68</S> into the mighty<S>5794</S> waters<S>4325</S>.
Moreover thou leddest<S>5148</S> them in the day<S>3119</S> by a cloudy<S>6051</S> pillar<S>5982</S>; and in the night<S>3915</S> by a pillar<S>5982</S> of fire<S>784</S>, to give them light<S>215</S> in the way<S>1870</S> wherein they should go<S>3212</S>.
Thou camest down<S>3381</S> also upon mount<S>2022</S> Sinai<S>5514</S>, and spakest<S>1696</S> with them from heaven<S>8064</S>, and gavest<S>5414</S> them right<S>3477</S> judgments<S>4941</S>, and true<S>571</S> laws<S>8451</S>, good<S>2896</S> statutes<S>2706</S> and commandments<S>4687</S>: <sup>true: Heb. laws of truth</sup>
And madest known<S>3045</S> unto them thy holy<S>6944</S> sabbath<S>7676</S>, and commandedst<S>6680</S> them precepts<S>4687</S>, statutes<S>2706</S>, and laws<S>8451</S>, by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> thy servant<S>5650</S>:
And gavest<S>5414</S> them bread<S>3899</S> from heaven<S>8064</S> for their hunger<S>7458</S>, and broughtest forth<S>3318</S> water<S>4325</S> for them out of the rock<S>5553</S> for their thirst<S>6772</S>, and promisedst<S>559</S> them that they should go in<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S> which thou hadst sworn<S>3027</S> <S>5375</S> to give<S>5414</S> them. <sup>which: Heb. which thou hadst lift up thine hand to give them</sup>
But they and our fathers<S>1</S> dealt proudly<S>2102</S>, and hardened<S>7185</S> their necks<S>6203</S>, and hearkened<S>8085</S> not to thy commandments<S>4687</S>,
And refused<S>3985</S> to obey<S>8085</S>, neither were mindful<S>2142</S> of thy wonders<S>6381</S> that thou didst<S>6213</S> among them; but hardened<S>7185</S> their necks<S>6203</S>, and in their rebellion<S>4805</S> appointed<S>5414</S> a captain<S>7218</S> to return<S>7725</S> to their bondage<S>5659</S>: but thou art a God<S>433</S> ready to pardon<S>5547</S>, gracious<S>2587</S> and merciful<S>7349</S>, slow<S>750</S> to anger<S>639</S>, and of great<S>7227</S> kindness<S>2617</S>, and forsookest<S>5800</S> them not. <sup>a God: Heb. a God of pardons</sup>
Yea, when they had made<S>6213</S> them a molten<S>4541</S> calf<S>5695</S>, and said<S>559</S>, This is thy God<S>430</S> that brought thee up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and had wrought<S>6213</S> great<S>1419</S> provocations<S>5007</S>;
Yet thou in thy manifold<S>7227</S> mercies<S>7356</S> forsookest<S>5800</S> them not in the wilderness<S>4057</S>: the pillar<S>5982</S> of the cloud<S>6051</S> departed<S>5493</S> not from them by day<S>3119</S>, to lead<S>5148</S> them in the way<S>1870</S>; neither the pillar<S>5982</S> of fire<S>784</S> by night<S>3915</S>, to shew them light<S>215</S>, and the way<S>1870</S> wherein they should go<S>3212</S>.
Thou gavest<S>5414</S> also thy good<S>2896</S> spirit<S>7307</S> to instruct<S>7919</S> them, and withheldest<S>4513</S> not thy manna<S>4478</S> from their mouth<S>6310</S>, and gavest<S>5414</S> them water<S>4325</S> for their thirst<S>6772</S>.
Yea, forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S> didst thou sustain<S>3557</S> them in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, so that they lacked<S>2637</S> nothing; their clothes<S>8008</S> waxed not old<S>1086</S>, and their feet<S>7272</S> swelled<S>1216</S> not.
Moreover thou gavest<S>5414</S> them kingdoms<S>4467</S> and nations<S>5971</S>, and didst divide<S>2505</S> them into corners<S>6285</S>: so they possessed<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S> of Sihon<S>5511</S>, and the land<S>776</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Heshbon<S>2809</S>, and the land<S>776</S> of Og<S>5747</S> king<S>4428</S> of Bashan<S>1316</S>.
Their children<S>1121</S> also multipliedst<S>7235</S> thou as the stars<S>3556</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and broughtest<S>935</S> them into the land<S>776</S>, concerning which thou hadst promised<S>559</S> to their fathers<S>1</S>, that they should go in<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it.
So the children<S>1121</S> went in<S>935</S> and possessed<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S>, and thou subduedst<S>3665</S> before<S>6440</S> them the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the land<S>776</S>, the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, and gavest<S>5414</S> them into their hands<S>3027</S>, with their kings<S>4428</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, that they might do<S>6213</S> with them as they would<S>7522</S>. <sup>as they: Heb. according to their will</sup>
And they took<S>3920</S> strong<S>1219</S> cities<S>5892</S>, and a fat<S>8082</S> land<S>127</S>, and possessed<S>3423</S> houses<S>1004</S> full<S>4392</S> of all goods<S>2898</S>, wells<S>953</S> digged<S>2672</S>, vineyards<S>3754</S>, and oliveyards<S>2132</S>, and fruit<S>3978</S> trees<S>6086</S> in abundance<S>7230</S>: so they did eat<S>398</S>, and were filled<S>7646</S>, and became fat<S>8080</S>, and delighted<S>5727</S> themselves in thy great<S>1419</S> goodness<S>2898</S>. <sup>wells: or, cisterns</sup> <sup>fruit: Heb. tree of food</sup>
Nevertheless they were disobedient<S>4784</S>, and rebelled<S>4775</S> against thee, and cast<S>7993</S> thy law<S>8451</S> behind<S>310</S> their backs<S>1458</S>, and slew<S>2026</S> thy prophets<S>5030</S> which testified<S>5749</S> against them to turn<S>7725</S> them to thee, and they wrought<S>6213</S> great<S>1419</S> provocations<S>5007</S>.
Therefore thou deliveredst<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>6862</S>, who vexed<S>6887</S> them: and in the time<S>6256</S> of their trouble<S>6869</S>, when they cried<S>6817</S> unto thee, thou heardest<S>8085</S> them from heaven<S>8064</S>; and according to thy manifold<S>7227</S> mercies<S>7356</S> thou gavest<S>5414</S> them saviours<S>3467</S>, who saved<S>3467</S> them out of the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>6862</S>.
But after they had rest<S>5117</S>, they did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> again<S>7725</S> before<S>6440</S> thee: therefore leftest<S>5800</S> thou them in the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>341</S>, so that they had the dominion<S>7287</S> over them: yet when they returned<S>7725</S>, and cried<S>2199</S> unto thee, thou heardest<S>8085</S> them from heaven<S>8064</S>; and many<S>7227</S> times<S>6256</S> didst thou deliver<S>5337</S> them according to thy mercies<S>7356</S>; <sup>they did: Heb. they returned to do evil</sup>
And testifiedst<S>5749</S> against them, that thou mightest bring them again<S>7725</S> unto thy law<S>8451</S>: yet they dealt proudly<S>2102</S>, and hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto thy commandments<S>4687</S>, but sinned<S>2398</S> against thy judgments<S>4941</S>, (which if a man<S>120</S> do<S>6213</S>, he shall live<S>2421</S> in them;) and withdrew<S>5414</S> <S>5637</S> the shoulder<S>3802</S>, and hardened<S>7185</S> their neck<S>6203</S>, and would not hear<S>8085</S>. <sup>withdrew: Heb. they gave a withdrawing shoulder</sup>
Yet many<S>7227</S> years<S>8141</S> didst thou forbear<S>4900</S> them, and testifiedst<S>5749</S> against them by thy spirit<S>7307</S> in<S>3027</S> thy prophets<S>5030</S>: yet would they not give ear<S>238</S>: therefore gavest<S>5414</S> thou them into the hand<S>3027</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of the lands<S>776</S>. <sup>forbear: Heb. protract over them</sup> <sup>in thy: Heb. in the hand of thy prophets</sup>

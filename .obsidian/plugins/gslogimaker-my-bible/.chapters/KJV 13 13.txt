And David<S>1732</S> consulted<S>3289</S> with the captains<S>8269</S> of thousands<S>505</S> and hundreds<S>3967</S>, and with every leader<S>5057</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the congregation<S>6951</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, If it seem good<S>2895</S> unto you, and that it be of the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, let us send<S>7971</S> abroad<S>6555</S> unto our brethren<S>251</S> every where, that are left<S>7604</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and with them also to the priests<S>3548</S> and Levites<S>3881</S> which are in their cities<S>5892</S> and suburbs<S>4054</S>, that they may gather<S>6908</S> themselves unto us: <sup>send: Heb. break forth and send</sup> <sup>in their: Heb. in the cities of their suburbs</sup>
And let us bring again<S>5437</S> the ark<S>727</S> of our God<S>430</S> to us: for we enquired<S>1875</S> not at it in the days<S>3117</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>. <sup>bring: Heb. bring about</sup>
And all the congregation<S>6951</S> said<S>559</S> that they would do so<S>6213</S>: for the thing<S>1697</S> was right<S>3474</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of all the people<S>5971</S>.
So David<S>1732</S> gathered<S>6950</S> all Israel<S>3478</S> together<S>6950</S>, from Shihor<S>7883</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> even unto the entering<S>935</S> of Hemath<S>2574</S>, to bring<S>935</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> from Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> went up<S>5927</S>, and all Israel<S>3478</S>, to Baalah<S>1173</S>, that is, to Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S>, which belonged to Judah<S>3063</S>, to bring up<S>5927</S> thence the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that dwelleth<S>3427</S> between the cherubims<S>3742</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> is called<S>7121</S> on it.
And they carried<S>7392</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> in a new<S>2319</S> cart<S>5699</S> out of the house<S>1004</S> of Abinadab<S>41</S>: and Uzza<S>5798</S> and Ahio<S>283</S> drave<S>5090</S> the cart<S>5699</S>. <sup>carried: Heb. made the ark to ride</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> and all Israel<S>3478</S> played<S>7832</S> before<S>6440</S> God<S>430</S> with all their might<S>5797</S>, and with singing<S>7892</S>, and with harps<S>3658</S>, and with psalteries<S>5035</S>, and with timbrels<S>8596</S>, and with cymbals<S>4700</S>, and with trumpets<S>2689</S>. <sup>singing: Heb. songs</sup>
And when they came<S>935</S> unto the threshingfloor<S>1637</S> of Chidon<S>3592</S>, Uzza<S>5798</S> put forth<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S> to hold<S>270</S> the ark<S>727</S>; for the oxen<S>1241</S> stumbled<S>8058</S>. <sup>Chidon: also called Nachon, 2.Sam.6.6.</sup> <sup>stumbled: or, shook it</sup>
And the anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was kindled<S>2734</S> against Uzza<S>5798</S>, and he smote<S>5221</S> him, because he put<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S> to the ark<S>727</S>: and there he died<S>4191</S> before<S>6440</S> God<S>430</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> was displeased<S>2734</S>, because the LORD<S>3068</S> had made<S>6555</S> a breach<S>6556</S> upon Uzza<S>5798</S>: wherefore that place<S>4725</S> is called<S>7121</S> Perezuzza<S>6560</S> to this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>Perezuzza: that is, The breach of Uzza</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> was afraid<S>3372</S> of God<S>430</S> that day<S>3117</S>, saying<S>559</S>, How<S>1963</S> shall I bring<S>935</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> home to me?
So David<S>1732</S> brought<S>5493</S> not the ark<S>727</S> home to himself to the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>, but carried it aside<S>5186</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of Obededom<S>5654</S> the Gittite<S>1663</S>. <sup>brought: Heb. removed</sup>
And the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> remained<S>3427</S> with the family<S>1004</S> of Obededom<S>5654</S> in his house<S>1004</S> three<S>7969</S> months<S>2320</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> blessed<S>1288</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Obededom<S>5654</S>, and all that he had.

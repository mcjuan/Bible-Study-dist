After<S>310</S> these things<S>1697</S>, when the wrath<S>2534</S> of king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> was appeased<S>7918</S>, he remembered<S>2142</S> Vashti<S>2060</S>, and what she had done<S>6213</S>, and what was decreed<S>1504</S> against her.
Then said<S>559</S> the king's<S>4428</S> servants<S>5288</S> that ministered<S>8334</S> unto him, Let there be fair<S>2896</S> <S>4758</S> young<S>5291</S> virgins<S>1330</S> sought<S>1245</S> for the king<S>4428</S>:
And let the king<S>4428</S> appoint<S>6485</S> officers<S>6496</S> in all the provinces<S>4082</S> of his kingdom<S>4438</S>, that they may gather together<S>6908</S> all the fair<S>2896</S> <S>4758</S> young<S>5291</S> virgins<S>1330</S> unto Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S>, to the house<S>1004</S> of the women<S>802</S>, unto the custody<S>3027</S> of Hege<S>1896</S> the king's<S>4428</S> chamberlain<S>5631</S>, keeper<S>8104</S> of the women<S>802</S>; and let their things for purification<S>8562</S> be given<S>5414</S> them: <sup>unto the: Heb. unto the hand</sup> <sup>Hege: or, Hegai</sup>
And let the maiden<S>5291</S> which pleaseth<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> the king<S>4428</S> be queen<S>4427</S> instead of Vashti<S>2060</S>. And the thing<S>1697</S> pleased<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> the king<S>4428</S>; and he did so<S>6213</S>.
Now in Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S> there was a certain<S>376</S> Jew<S>3064</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Mordecai<S>4782</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jair<S>2971</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Shimei<S>8096</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Kish<S>7027</S>, a Benjamite<S>1145</S>;
Who had been carried away<S>1540</S> from Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with the captivity<S>1473</S> which had been carried away<S>1540</S> with Jeconiah<S>3204</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, whom Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had carried away<S>1540</S>. <sup>Jeconiah: or, Jehoiachin</sup>
And he brought up<S>539</S> Hadassah<S>1919</S>, that is, Esther<S>635</S>, his uncle's<S>1730</S> daughter<S>1323</S>: for she had neither father<S>1</S> nor mother<S>517</S>, and the maid<S>5291</S> was fair<S>3303</S> <S>8389</S> and beautiful<S>2896</S> <S>4758</S>; whom Mordecai<S>4782</S>, when her father<S>1</S> and mother<S>517</S> were dead<S>4194</S>, took<S>3947</S> for his own daughter<S>1323</S>. <sup>brought: Heb. nourished</sup> <sup>fair: Heb. fair of form, and good of countenance</sup>
So it came to pass, when the king's<S>4428</S> commandment<S>1697</S> and his decree<S>1881</S> was heard<S>8085</S>, and when many<S>7227</S> maidens<S>5291</S> were gathered together<S>6908</S> unto Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S>, to the custody<S>3027</S> of Hegai<S>1896</S>, that Esther<S>635</S> was brought<S>3947</S> also unto the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, to the custody<S>3027</S> of Hegai<S>1896</S>, keeper<S>8104</S> of the women<S>802</S>.
And the maiden<S>5291</S> pleased<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> him, and she obtained<S>5375</S> kindness<S>2617</S> of him<S>6440</S>; and he speedily<S>926</S> gave<S>5414</S> her her things for purification<S>8562</S>, with such things as belonged<S>4490</S> to her, and seven<S>7651</S> maidens<S>5291</S>, which were meet<S>7200</S> to be given<S>5414</S> her, out of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>: and he preferred<S>8138</S> her and her maids<S>5291</S> unto the best<S>2896</S> place of the house<S>1004</S> of the women<S>802</S>. <sup>such: Heb. her portions</sup> <sup>preferred: Heb. changed</sup>
Esther<S>635</S> had not shewed<S>5046</S> her people<S>5971</S> nor her kindred<S>4138</S>: for Mordecai<S>4782</S> had charged<S>6680</S> her that she should not shew<S>5046</S> it.
And Mordecai<S>4782</S> walked<S>1980</S> every day<S>3117</S> before<S>6440</S> the court<S>2691</S> of the women's<S>802</S> house<S>1004</S>, to know<S>3045</S> how Esther<S>635</S> did<S>7965</S>, and what should become<S>6213</S> of her. <sup>to know: Heb. to know the peace</sup>
Now when every maid's<S>5291</S> turn<S>8447</S> was come<S>5060</S> to go in<S>935</S> to king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S>, after<S>7093</S> that she had been twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> months<S>2320</S>, according to the manner<S>1881</S> of the women<S>802</S>, (for so were the days<S>3117</S> of their purifications<S>4795</S> accomplished<S>4390</S>, to wit, six<S>8337</S> months<S>2320</S> with oil<S>8081</S> of myrrh<S>4753</S>, and six<S>8337</S> months<S>2320</S> with sweet odours<S>1314</S>, and with other things for the purifying<S>8562</S> of the women<S>802</S>;)
Then thus came<S>935</S> every maiden<S>5291</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>; whatsoever she desired<S>559</S> was given<S>5414</S> her to go<S>935</S> with her out of the house<S>1004</S> of the women<S>802</S> unto the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>.
In the evening<S>6153</S> she went<S>935</S>, and on the morrow<S>1242</S> she returned<S>7725</S> into the second<S>8145</S> house<S>1004</S> of the women<S>802</S>, to the custody<S>3027</S> of Shaashgaz<S>8190</S>, the king's<S>4428</S> chamberlain<S>5631</S>, which kept<S>8104</S> the concubines<S>6370</S>: she came in<S>935</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> no more, except the king<S>4428</S> delighted<S>2654</S> in her, and that she were called<S>7121</S> by name<S>8034</S>.
Now when the turn<S>8447</S> of Esther<S>635</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Abihail<S>32</S> the uncle<S>1730</S> of Mordecai<S>4782</S>, who had taken<S>3947</S> her for his daughter<S>1323</S>, was come<S>5060</S> to go in<S>935</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, she required<S>1245</S> nothing<S>1697</S> but what Hegai<S>1896</S> the king's<S>4428</S> chamberlain<S>5631</S>, the keeper<S>8104</S> of the women<S>802</S>, appointed<S>559</S>. And Esther<S>635</S> obtained<S>5375</S> favour<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of all them that looked<S>7200</S> upon her.
So Esther<S>635</S> was taken<S>3947</S> unto king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> into his house<S>1004</S> royal<S>4438</S> in the tenth<S>6224</S> month<S>2320</S>, which is the month<S>2320</S> Tebeth<S>2887</S>, in the seventh<S>7651</S> year<S>8141</S> of his reign<S>4438</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> loved<S>157</S> Esther<S>635</S> above all the women<S>802</S>, and she obtained<S>5375</S> grace<S>2580</S> and favour<S>2617</S> in his sight<S>6440</S> more than all the virgins<S>1330</S>; so that he set<S>7760</S> the royal<S>4438</S> crown<S>3804</S> upon her head<S>7218</S>, and made her queen<S>4427</S> instead of Vashti<S>2060</S>. <sup>favour: or, kindness</sup> <sup>in his: Heb. before him</sup>
Then the king<S>4428</S> made<S>6213</S> a great<S>1419</S> feast<S>4960</S> unto all his princes<S>8269</S> and his servants<S>5650</S>, even Esther's<S>635</S> feast<S>4960</S>; and he made<S>6213</S> a release<S>2010</S> to the provinces<S>4082</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> gifts<S>4864</S>, according to the state<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S>. <sup>release: Heb. rest</sup>
And when the virgins<S>1330</S> were gathered together<S>6908</S> the second time<S>8145</S>, then Mordecai<S>4782</S> sat<S>3427</S> in the king's<S>4428</S> gate<S>8179</S>.
Esther<S>635</S> had not yet shewed<S>5046</S> her kindred<S>4138</S> nor her people<S>5971</S>; as Mordecai<S>4782</S> had charged<S>6680</S> her: for Esther<S>635</S> did<S>6213</S> the commandment<S>3982</S> of Mordecai<S>4782</S>, like as when she was brought up<S>545</S> with him.
In those days<S>3117</S>, while Mordecai<S>4782</S> sat<S>3427</S> in the king's<S>4428</S> gate<S>8179</S>, two<S>8147</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> chamberlains<S>5631</S>, Bigthan<S>904</S> and Teresh<S>8657</S>, of those which kept<S>8104</S> the door<S>5592</S>, were wroth<S>7107</S>, and sought<S>1245</S> to lay<S>7971</S> hand<S>3027</S> on the king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S>. <sup>Bigthan: or, Bigthana</sup> <sup>the door: Heb. the threshold</sup>
And the thing<S>1697</S> was known<S>3045</S> to Mordecai<S>4782</S>, who told<S>5046</S> it unto Esther<S>635</S> the queen<S>4436</S>; and Esther<S>635</S> certified<S>559</S> the king<S>4428</S> thereof in Mordecai's<S>4782</S> name<S>8034</S>.
And when inquisition<S>1245</S> was made of the matter<S>1697</S>, it was found out<S>4672</S>; therefore they were both<S>8147</S> hanged<S>8518</S> on a tree<S>6086</S>: and it was written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S>.

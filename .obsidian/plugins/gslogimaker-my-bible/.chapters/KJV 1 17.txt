And when Abram<S>87</S> was ninety<S>8673</S> <S>8141</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> and nine<S>8672</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> appeared<S>7200</S> to Abram<S>87</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, I am the Almighty<S>7706</S> God<S>410</S>; walk<S>1980</S> before me<S>6440</S>, and be thou perfect<S>8549</S>. <sup>perfect: or, upright, or, sincere</sup>
And I will make<S>5414</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> between me and thee, and will multiply<S>7235</S> thee exceedingly<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S>.
And Abram<S>87</S> fell<S>5307</S> on his face<S>6440</S>: and God<S>430</S> talked<S>1696</S> with him, saying<S>559</S>,
As for me<S>589</S>, behold, my covenant<S>1285</S> is with thee, and thou shalt be a father<S>1</S> of many<S>1995</S> nations<S>1471</S>. <sup>many: Heb. multitude of nations</sup>
Neither shall thy name<S>8034</S> any more be called<S>7121</S> Abram<S>87</S>, but thy name<S>8034</S> shall be Abraham<S>85</S>; for a father<S>1</S> of many<S>1995</S> nations<S>1471</S> have I made thee<S>5414</S>. <sup>Abraham: that is, Father of a great multitude</sup>
And I will make<S>6509</S> thee exceeding<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S> fruitful<S>6509</S>, and I will make<S>5414</S> nations<S>1471</S> of thee, and kings<S>4428</S> shall come out<S>3318</S> of thee.
And I will establish<S>6965</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> between me and thee and thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S> in their generations<S>1755</S> for an everlasting<S>5769</S> covenant<S>1285</S>, to be a God<S>430</S> unto thee, and to thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S>.
And I will give<S>5414</S> unto thee, and to thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S>, the land<S>776</S> wherein thou art a stranger<S>4033</S>, all the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, for an everlasting<S>5769</S> possession<S>272</S>; and I will be their God<S>430</S>. <sup>wherein: Heb. of thy sojournings</sup>
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abraham<S>85</S>, Thou shalt keep<S>8104</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> therefore, thou, and thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S> in their generations<S>1755</S>.
This is my covenant<S>1285</S>, which ye shall keep<S>8104</S>, between me and you and thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S>; Every man child<S>2145</S> among you shall be circumcised<S>4135</S>.
And ye shall circumcise<S>5243</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> of your foreskin<S>6190</S>; and it shall be a token<S>226</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> betwixt me and you.
And he that is eight<S>8083</S> days<S>3117</S> old<S>1121</S> shall be circumcised<S>4135</S> among you, every man child<S>2145</S> in your generations<S>1755</S>, he that is born<S>3211</S> in the house<S>1004</S>, or bought<S>4736</S> with money<S>3701</S> of any stranger<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S>, which is not of thy seed<S>2233</S>. <sup>he that is eight: Heb. a son of eight days</sup>
He that is born<S>3211</S> in thy house<S>1004</S>, and he that is bought<S>4736</S> with thy money<S>3701</S>, must needs<S>4135</S> be circumcised<S>4135</S>: and my covenant<S>1285</S> shall be in your flesh<S>1320</S> for an everlasting<S>5769</S> covenant<S>1285</S>.
And the uncircumcised<S>6189</S> man child<S>2145</S> whose<S>834</S> flesh<S>1320</S> of his foreskin<S>6190</S> is not circumcised<S>4135</S>, that soul<S>5315</S> shall be cut off<S>3772</S> from his people<S>5971</S>; he hath broken<S>6565</S> my covenant<S>1285</S>.
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abraham<S>85</S>, As for Sarai<S>8297</S> thy wife<S>802</S>, thou shalt not call<S>7121</S> her name<S>8034</S> Sarai<S>8297</S>, but<S>3588</S> Sarah<S>8283</S> shall her name<S>8034</S> be. <sup>Sarah: that is Princess</sup>
And I will bless<S>1288</S> her, and give<S>5414</S> thee a son<S>1121</S> also of her: yea, I will bless<S>1288</S> her, and she shall be a mother of nations<S>1471</S>; kings<S>4428</S> of people<S>5971</S> shall be of her. <sup>she: Heb. she shall become nations</sup>
Then Abraham<S>85</S> fell<S>5307</S> upon his face<S>6440</S>, and laughed<S>6711</S>, and said<S>559</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, Shall a child be born<S>3205</S> unto him that is an hundred<S>3967</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>? and shall Sarah<S>8283</S>, that is ninety<S>8673</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1323</S>, bear<S>3205</S>?
And Abraham<S>85</S> said<S>559</S> unto God<S>430</S>, O that<S>3863</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> might live<S>2421</S> before thee<S>6440</S>!
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, Sarah<S>8283</S> thy wife<S>802</S> shall bear<S>3205</S> thee a son<S>1121</S> indeed<S>61</S>; and thou shalt call<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Isaac<S>3327</S>: and I will establish<S>6965</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> with him for an everlasting<S>5769</S> covenant<S>1285</S>, and with his seed<S>2233</S> after him<S>310</S>.
And as for Ishmael<S>3458</S>, I have heard thee<S>8085</S>: Behold, I have blessed<S>1288</S> him, and will make him fruitful<S>6509</S>, and will multiply<S>7235</S> him exceedingly<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S>; twelve<S>6240</S> <S>8147</S> princes<S>5387</S> shall he beget<S>3205</S>, and I will make him<S>5414</S> a great<S>1419</S> nation<S>1471</S>.
But my covenant<S>1285</S> will I establish<S>6965</S> with Isaac<S>3327</S>, which Sarah<S>8283</S> shall bear<S>3205</S> unto thee at this set time<S>4150</S> in the next<S>312</S> year<S>8141</S>.
And he left off<S>3615</S> talking<S>1696</S> with him, and God<S>430</S> went up<S>5927</S> from Abraham<S>85</S>.
And Abraham<S>85</S> took<S>3947</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> his son<S>1121</S>, and all that were born<S>3211</S> in his house<S>1004</S>, and all that were bought<S>4736</S> with his money<S>3701</S>, every male<S>2145</S> among the men<S>582</S> of Abraham's<S>85</S> house<S>1004</S>; and circumcised<S>4135</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> of their foreskin<S>6190</S> in the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S>, as God<S>430</S> had said<S>1696</S> unto him.
And Abraham<S>85</S> was ninety<S>8673</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> and nine<S>8672</S>, when he was circumcised<S>4135</S> in the flesh<S>1320</S> of his foreskin<S>6190</S>.
And Ishmael<S>3458</S> his son<S>1121</S> was thirteen<S>6240</S> <S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, when he was circumcised<S>4135</S> in the flesh<S>1320</S> of his foreskin<S>6190</S>.
In the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S> was Abraham<S>85</S> circumcised<S>4135</S>, and Ishmael<S>3458</S> his son<S>1121</S>.
And all the men<S>582</S> of his house<S>1004</S>, born<S>3211</S> in the house<S>1004</S>, and bought<S>4736</S> with money<S>3701</S> of the stranger<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S>, were circumcised<S>4135</S> with him.

Now the serpent<S>5175</S> was<S>1961</S> more subtil<S>6175</S> than any beast<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> had made<S>6213</S>. And he said<S>559</S> unto the woman<S>802</S>, Yea<S>637</S>, hath God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, Ye shall not eat<S>398</S> of every tree<S>6086</S> of the garden<S>1588</S>? <sup>Yea: Heb. Yea, because, etc.</sup>
And the woman<S>802</S> said<S>559</S> unto the serpent<S>5175</S>, We may eat<S>398</S> of the fruit<S>6529</S> of the trees<S>6086</S> of the garden<S>1588</S>:
But of the fruit<S>6529</S> of the tree<S>6086</S> which is in the midst<S>8432</S> of the garden<S>1588</S>, God<S>430</S> hath said<S>559</S>, Ye shall not eat<S>398</S> of it, neither shall ye touch<S>5060</S> it, lest<S>6435</S> ye die<S>4191</S>.
And the serpent<S>5175</S> said<S>559</S> unto the woman<S>802</S>, Ye shall not surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>:
For God<S>430</S> doth know<S>3045</S> that in the day<S>3117</S> ye eat<S>398</S> thereof, then your eyes<S>5869</S> shall be opened<S>6491</S>, and ye shall be as gods<S>430</S>, knowing<S>3045</S> good<S>2896</S> and evil<S>7451</S>.
And when the woman<S>802</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the tree<S>6086</S> was good<S>2896</S> for food<S>3978</S>, and that it<S>1931</S> was pleasant<S>8378</S> to the eyes<S>5869</S>, and a tree<S>6086</S> to be desired<S>2530</S> to make one wise<S>7919</S>, she took<S>3947</S> of the fruit thereof<S>6529</S>, and did eat<S>398</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> also<S>1571</S> unto her husband<S>376</S> with her; and he did eat<S>398</S>. <sup>pleasant: Heb. a desire</sup>
And the eyes<S>5869</S> of them both<S>8147</S> were opened<S>6491</S>, and they<S>1992</S> knew<S>3045</S> that they were naked<S>5903</S>; and they sewed<S>8609</S> fig<S>8384</S> leaves<S>5929</S> together<S>8609</S>, and made themselves<S>6213</S> aprons<S>2290</S>. <sup>aprons: or, things to gird about</sup>
And they heard<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> walking<S>1980</S> in the garden<S>1588</S> in the cool<S>7307</S> of the day<S>3117</S>: and Adam<S>120</S> and his wife<S>802</S> hid themselves<S>2244</S> from the presence<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> amongst<S>8432</S> the trees<S>6086</S> of the garden<S>1588</S>. <sup>cool: Heb. wind</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> called<S>7121</S> unto Adam<S>120</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Where art thou<S>335</S>?
And he said<S>559</S>, I heard<S>8085</S> thy voice<S>6963</S> in the garden<S>1588</S>, and I was afraid<S>3372</S>, because I<S>595</S> was naked<S>5903</S>; and I hid myself<S>2244</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Who<S>4310</S> told<S>5046</S> thee that thou wast naked<S>5903</S>? Hast thou eaten<S>398</S> of the tree<S>6086</S>, whereof I commanded thee<S>6680</S> that thou shouldest not<S>1115</S> eat<S>398</S>?
And the man<S>120</S> said<S>559</S>, The woman<S>802</S> whom thou gavest<S>5414</S> to be with me<S>5978</S>, she<S>1931</S> gave<S>5414</S> me of the tree<S>6086</S>, and I did eat<S>398</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto the woman<S>802</S>, What is this that thou hast done<S>6213</S>? And the woman<S>802</S> said<S>559</S>, The serpent<S>5175</S> beguiled me<S>5377</S>, and I did eat<S>398</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto the serpent<S>5175</S>, Because thou<S>859</S> hast done<S>6213</S> this, thou art cursed<S>779</S> above all cattle<S>929</S>, and above every beast<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S>; upon thy belly<S>1512</S> shalt thou go<S>3212</S>, and dust<S>6083</S> shalt thou eat<S>398</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of thy life<S>2416</S>:
And I will put<S>7896</S> enmity<S>342</S> between thee and the woman<S>802</S>, and between thy seed<S>2233</S> and her seed<S>2233</S>; it shall bruise<S>7779</S> thy head<S>7218</S>, and thou shalt bruise<S>7779</S> his heel<S>6119</S>.
Unto the woman<S>802</S> he said<S>559</S>, I will greatly<S>7235</S> multiply<S>7235</S> thy sorrow<S>6093</S> and thy conception<S>2032</S>; in sorrow<S>6089</S> thou shalt bring forth<S>3205</S> children<S>1121</S>; and thy desire<S>8669</S> shall be to thy husband<S>376</S>, and he shall rule<S>4910</S> over thee. <sup>to thy: or, subject to thy husband</sup>
And unto Adam<S>121</S> he said<S>559</S>, Because thou hast hearkened<S>8085</S> unto the voice<S>6963</S> of thy wife<S>802</S>, and hast eaten<S>398</S> of the tree<S>6086</S>, of which<S>834</S> I commanded thee<S>6680</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thou shalt not eat<S>398</S> of it: cursed<S>779</S> is the ground<S>127</S> for thy sake; in sorrow<S>6093</S> shalt thou eat<S>398</S> of it all<S>3605</S> the days<S>3117</S> of thy life<S>2416</S>;
Thorns also<S>6975</S> and thistles<S>1863</S> shall it bring forth<S>6779</S> to thee; and thou shalt eat<S>398</S> the herb<S>6212</S> of the field<S>7704</S>; <sup>bring: Heb. cause to bud</sup>
In the sweat<S>2188</S> of thy face<S>639</S> shalt thou eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, till<S>5704</S> thou return<S>7725</S> unto the ground<S>127</S>; for out of it wast thou taken<S>3947</S>: for dust<S>6083</S> thou<S>859</S> art, and unto dust<S>6083</S> shalt thou return<S>7725</S>.
And Adam<S>120</S> called<S>7121</S> his wife's<S>802</S> name<S>8034</S> Eve<S>2332</S>; because she was the mother<S>517</S> of all living<S>2416</S>. <sup>Eve: Heb. Chavah: that is Living</sup>
Unto Adam<S>120</S> also and to his wife<S>802</S> did the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> make<S>6213</S> coats<S>3801</S> of skins<S>5785</S>, and clothed them<S>3847</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, Behold<S>2005</S>, the man<S>120</S> is become as one<S>259</S> of us, to know<S>3045</S> good<S>2896</S> and evil<S>7451</S>: and now, lest he put forth<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, and take<S>3947</S> also of the tree<S>6086</S> of life<S>2416</S>, and eat<S>398</S>, and live<S>2425</S> for ever<S>5769</S>:
Therefore the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> sent him forth<S>7971</S> from the garden<S>1588</S> of Eden<S>5731</S>, to till<S>5647</S> the ground<S>127</S> from whence he was taken<S>3947</S>.
So he drove out<S>1644</S> the man<S>120</S>; and he placed<S>7931</S> at the east<S>6924</S> of the garden<S>1588</S> of Eden<S>5731</S> Cherubims<S>3742</S>, and a flaming<S>3858</S> sword<S>2719</S> which turned every way<S>2015</S>, to keep<S>8104</S> the way<S>1870</S> of the tree<S>6086</S> of life<S>2416</S>.

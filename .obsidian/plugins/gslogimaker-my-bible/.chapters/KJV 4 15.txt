And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>1696</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto them, When ye be come<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of your habitations<S>4186</S>, which I give<S>5414</S> unto you,
And will make<S>6213</S> an offering by fire<S>801</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, a burnt offering<S>5930</S>, or a sacrifice<S>2077</S> in performing<S>6381</S> a vow<S>5088</S>, or in a freewill offering<S>5071</S>, or in your solemn feasts<S>4150</S>, to make<S>6213</S> a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, of the herd<S>1241</S>, or of the flock<S>6629</S>: <sup>performing: Heb. separating</sup>
Then shall he that offereth<S>7126</S> his offering<S>7133</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> bring<S>7126</S> a meat offering<S>4503</S> of a tenth deal<S>6241</S> of flour<S>5560</S> mingled<S>1101</S> with the fourth<S>7243</S> part of an hin<S>1969</S> of oil<S>8081</S>.
And the fourth<S>7243</S> part of an hin<S>1969</S> of wine<S>3196</S> for a drink offering<S>5262</S> shalt thou prepare<S>6213</S> with the burnt offering<S>5930</S> or sacrifice<S>2077</S>, for one<S>259</S> lamb<S>3532</S>.
Or for a ram<S>352</S>, thou shalt prepare<S>6213</S> for a meat offering<S>4503</S> two<S>8147</S> tenth deals<S>6241</S> of flour<S>5560</S> mingled<S>1101</S> with the third<S>7992</S> part of an hin<S>1969</S> of oil<S>8081</S>.
And for a drink offering<S>5262</S> thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> the third<S>7992</S> part of an hin<S>1969</S> of wine<S>3196</S>, for a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And when thou preparest<S>6213</S> a bullock<S>1121</S> <S>1241</S> for a burnt offering<S>5930</S>, or for a sacrifice<S>2077</S> in performing<S>6381</S> a vow<S>5088</S>, or peace offerings<S>8002</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>:
Then shall he bring<S>7126</S> with a bullock<S>1241</S> <S>1121</S> a meat offering<S>4503</S> of three<S>7969</S> tenth deals<S>6241</S> of flour<S>5560</S> mingled<S>1101</S> with half<S>2677</S> an hin<S>1969</S> of oil<S>8081</S>.
And thou shalt bring<S>7126</S> for a drink offering<S>5262</S> half<S>2677</S> an hin<S>1969</S> of wine<S>3196</S>, for an offering made by fire<S>801</S>, of a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Thus shall it be done<S>6213</S> for one<S>259</S> bullock<S>7794</S>, or for one<S>259</S> ram<S>352</S>, or for a lamb<S>3532</S> <S>7716</S>, or a kid<S>5795</S>.
According to the number<S>4557</S> that ye shall prepare<S>6213</S>, so<S>3602</S> shall ye do<S>6213</S> to every one<S>259</S> according to their number<S>4557</S>.
All that are born of the country<S>249</S> shall do<S>6213</S> these things after this manner, in offering<S>7126</S> an offering made by fire<S>801</S>, of a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And if a stranger<S>1616</S> sojourn<S>1481</S> with you, or whosoever be among<S>8432</S> you in your generations<S>1755</S>, and will offer<S>6213</S> an offering made by fire<S>801</S>, of a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; as ye do<S>6213</S>, so he shall do<S>6213</S>.
One<S>259</S> ordinance<S>2708</S> shall be both for you of the congregation<S>6951</S>, and also for the stranger<S>1616</S> that sojourneth<S>1481</S> with you, an ordinance<S>2708</S> for ever<S>5769</S> in your generations<S>1755</S>: as ye are, so shall the stranger<S>1616</S> be before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
One<S>259</S> law<S>8451</S> and one<S>259</S> manner<S>4941</S> shall be for you, and for the stranger<S>1616</S> that sojourneth<S>1481</S> with you.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>1696</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto them, When ye come<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> whither I bring<S>935</S> you,
Then it shall be, that, when ye eat<S>398</S> of the bread<S>3899</S> of the land<S>776</S>, ye shall offer up<S>7311</S> an heave offering<S>8641</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Ye shall offer up<S>7311</S> a cake<S>2471</S> of the first<S>7225</S> of your dough<S>6182</S> for an heave offering<S>8641</S>: as ye do the heave offering<S>8641</S> of the threshingfloor<S>1637</S>, so shall ye heave<S>7311</S> it.
Of the first<S>7225</S> of your dough<S>6182</S> ye shall give<S>5414</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> an heave offering<S>8641</S> in your generations<S>1755</S>.
And if ye have erred<S>7686</S>, and not observed<S>6213</S> all these commandments<S>4687</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath spoken<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>,
Even all that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> you by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>, from the day<S>3117</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses, and henceforward<S>1973</S> among your generations<S>1755</S>;
Then it shall be, if ought be committed<S>6213</S> by ignorance<S>7684</S> without the knowledge<S>5869</S> of the congregation<S>5712</S>, that all the congregation<S>5712</S> shall offer<S>6213</S> one<S>259</S> young<S>1121</S> <S>1241</S> bullock<S>6499</S> for a burnt offering<S>5930</S>, for a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, with his meat offering<S>4503</S>, and his drink offering<S>5262</S>, according to the manner<S>4941</S>, and one<S>259</S> kid<S>8163</S> of the goats<S>5795</S> for a sin offering<S>2403</S>. <sup>without: Heb. from the eyes</sup> <sup>manner: or, ordinance</sup>
And the priest<S>3548</S> shall make an atonement<S>3722</S> for all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and it shall be forgiven<S>5545</S> them; for it is ignorance<S>7684</S>: and they shall bring<S>935</S> their offering<S>7133</S>, a sacrifice made by fire<S>801</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and their sin offering<S>2403</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, for their ignorance<S>7684</S>:
And it shall be forgiven<S>5545</S> all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and the stranger<S>1616</S> that sojourneth<S>1481</S> among<S>8432</S> them; seeing all the people<S>5971</S> were in ignorance<S>7684</S>.
And if any<S>259</S> soul<S>5315</S> sin<S>2398</S> through ignorance<S>7684</S>, then he shall bring<S>7126</S> a she goat<S>5795</S> of the first<S>1323</S> year<S>8141</S> for a sin offering<S>2403</S>.
And the priest<S>3548</S> shall make an atonement<S>3722</S> for the soul<S>5315</S> that sinneth ignorantly<S>7683</S>, when he sinneth<S>2398</S> by ignorance<S>7684</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to make an atonement<S>3722</S> for him; and it shall be forgiven<S>5545</S> him.
Ye shall have one<S>259</S> law<S>8451</S> for him that sinneth<S>6213</S> through ignorance<S>7684</S>, both for him that is born<S>249</S> among the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and for the stranger<S>1616</S> that sojourneth<S>1481</S> among<S>8432</S> them. <sup>sinneth: Heb. doth</sup>
But the soul<S>5315</S> that doeth<S>6213</S> ought presumptuously<S>7311</S> <S>3027</S>, whether he be born in the land<S>249</S>, or a stranger<S>4480</S> <S>1616</S>, the same reproacheth<S>1442</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; and that soul<S>5315</S> shall be cut off<S>3772</S> from among<S>7130</S> his people<S>5971</S>. <sup>presumptuously: Heb. with an high hand</sup>
Because he hath despised<S>959</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and hath broken<S>6565</S> his commandment<S>4687</S>, that soul<S>5315</S> shall utterly<S>3772</S> be cut off<S>3772</S>; his iniquity<S>5771</S> shall be upon him.
And while the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, they found<S>4672</S> a man<S>376</S> that gathered<S>7197</S> sticks<S>6086</S> upon the sabbath<S>7676</S> day<S>3117</S>.
And they that found<S>4672</S> him gathering<S>7197</S> sticks<S>6086</S> brought<S>7126</S> him unto Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, and unto all the congregation<S>5712</S>.
And they put<S>3240</S> him in ward<S>4929</S>, because it was not declared<S>6567</S> what should be done<S>6213</S> to him.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, The man<S>376</S> shall be surely<S>4191</S> put to death<S>4191</S>: all the congregation<S>5712</S> shall stone<S>7275</S> him with stones<S>68</S> without<S>2351</S> the camp<S>4264</S>.
And all the congregation<S>5712</S> brought<S>3318</S> him without<S>2351</S> the camp<S>4264</S>, and stoned<S>7275</S> him with stones<S>68</S>, and he died<S>4191</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>1696</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and bid<S>559</S> them that they make<S>6213</S> them fringes<S>6734</S> in the borders<S>3671</S> of their garments<S>899</S> throughout their generations<S>1755</S>, and that they put<S>5414</S> upon the fringe<S>6734</S> of the borders<S>3671</S> a ribband<S>6616</S> of blue<S>8504</S>:
And it shall be unto you for a fringe<S>6734</S>, that ye may look<S>7200</S> upon it, and remember<S>2142</S> all the commandments<S>4687</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and do<S>6213</S> them; and that ye seek<S>8446</S> not after<S>310</S> your own heart<S>3824</S> and your own eyes<S>5869</S>, after<S>310</S> which ye use to go a whoring<S>2181</S>:
That ye may remember<S>2142</S>, and do<S>6213</S> all my commandments<S>4687</S>, and be<S>1961</S> holy<S>6918</S> unto your God<S>430</S>.
I am the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, which brought you out<S>3318</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, to be your God<S>430</S>: I am the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>.

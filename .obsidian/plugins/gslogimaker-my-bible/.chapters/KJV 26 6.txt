And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, set<S>7760</S> thy face<S>6440</S> toward the mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and prophesy<S>5012</S> against them,
And say<S>559</S>, Ye mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> to the mountains<S>2022</S>, and to the hills<S>1389</S>, to the rivers<S>650</S>, and to the valleys<S>1516</S>; Behold, I, even I, will bring<S>935</S> a sword<S>2719</S> upon you, and I will destroy<S>6</S> your high places<S>1116</S>.
And your altars<S>4196</S> shall be desolate<S>8074</S>, and your images<S>2553</S> shall be broken<S>7665</S>: and I will cast down<S>5307</S> your slain<S>2491</S> men before<S>6440</S> your idols<S>1544</S>. <sup>images: or, sun images</sup>
And I will lay<S>5414</S> the dead carcases<S>6297</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> before<S>6440</S> their idols<S>1544</S>; and I will scatter<S>2219</S> your bones<S>6106</S> round about<S>5439</S> your altars<S>4196</S>. <sup>lay: Heb. give</sup>
In all your dwellingplaces<S>4186</S> the cities<S>5892</S> shall be laid waste<S>2717</S>, and the high places<S>1116</S> shall be desolate<S>3456</S>; that your altars<S>4196</S> may be laid waste<S>2717</S> and made desolate<S>816</S>, and your idols<S>1544</S> may be broken<S>7665</S> and cease<S>7673</S>, and your images<S>2553</S> may be cut down<S>1438</S>, and your works<S>4639</S> may be abolished<S>4229</S>.
And the slain<S>2491</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of you, and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Yet will I leave a remnant<S>3498</S>, that ye may have some that shall escape<S>6412</S> the sword<S>2719</S> among the nations<S>1471</S>, when ye shall be scattered<S>2219</S> through the countries<S>776</S>.
And they that escape<S>6412</S> of you shall remember<S>2142</S> me among the nations<S>1471</S> whither they shall be carried captives<S>7617</S>, because I am broken<S>7665</S> with their whorish<S>2181</S> heart<S>3820</S>, which hath departed<S>5493</S> from me, and with their eyes<S>5869</S>, which go a whoring<S>2181</S> after<S>310</S> their idols<S>1544</S>: and they shall lothe<S>6962</S> themselves<S>6440</S> for the evils<S>7451</S> which they have committed<S>6213</S> in all their abominations<S>8441</S>.
And they shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>, and that I have not said<S>1696</S> in vain<S>2600</S> that I would do<S>6213</S> this evil<S>7451</S> unto them.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Smite<S>5221</S> with thine hand<S>3709</S>, and stamp<S>7554</S> with thy foot<S>7272</S>, and say<S>559</S>, Alas<S>253</S> for all the evil<S>7451</S> abominations<S>8441</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>! for they shall fall<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>, by the famine<S>7458</S>, and by the pestilence<S>1698</S>.
He that is far off<S>7350</S> shall die<S>4191</S> of the pestilence<S>1698</S>; and he that is near<S>7138</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>; and he that remaineth<S>7604</S> and is besieged<S>5341</S> shall die<S>4191</S> by the famine<S>7458</S>: thus will I accomplish<S>3615</S> my fury<S>2534</S> upon them.
Then shall ye know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>, when their slain<S>2491</S> men shall be among<S>8432</S> their idols<S>1544</S> round about<S>5439</S> their altars<S>4196</S>, upon every high<S>7311</S> hill<S>1389</S>, in all the tops<S>7218</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>, and under every green<S>7488</S> tree<S>6086</S>, and under every thick<S>5687</S> oak<S>424</S>, the place<S>4725</S> where they did offer<S>5414</S> sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> to all their idols<S>1544</S>.
So will I stretch out<S>5186</S> my hand<S>3027</S> upon them, and make<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> desolate<S>8077</S>, yea, more desolate<S>4923</S> than the wilderness<S>4057</S> toward Diblath<S>1689</S>, in all their habitations<S>4186</S>: and they shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>more: or, desolate from the wilderness</sup>

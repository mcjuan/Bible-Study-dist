Afterward he brought<S>3212</S> me to the gate<S>8179</S>, even the gate<S>8179</S> that looketh<S>6437</S> toward<S>1870</S> the east<S>6921</S>:
And, behold, the glory<S>3519</S> of the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came<S>935</S> from the way<S>1870</S> of the east<S>6921</S>: and his voice<S>6963</S> was like a noise<S>6963</S> of many<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S>: and the earth<S>776</S> shined<S>215</S> with his glory<S>3519</S>.
And it was according to the appearance<S>4758</S> of the vision<S>4758</S> which I saw<S>7200</S>, even according to the vision<S>4758</S> that I saw<S>7200</S> when I came<S>935</S> to destroy<S>7843</S> the city<S>5892</S>: and the visions<S>4759</S> were like the vision<S>4758</S> that I saw<S>7200</S> by the river<S>5104</S> Chebar<S>3529</S>; and I fell<S>5307</S> upon my face<S>6440</S>. <sup>when: or, when I came to prophesy that the city should be destroyed</sup>
And the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> whose prospect<S>6440</S> is toward<S>1870</S> the east<S>6921</S>.
So the spirit<S>7307</S> took me up<S>5375</S>, and brought<S>935</S> me into the inner<S>6442</S> court<S>2691</S>; and, behold, the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> filled<S>4390</S> the house<S>1004</S>.
And I heard<S>8085</S> him speaking<S>1696</S> unto me out of the house<S>1004</S>; and the man<S>376</S> stood<S>5975</S> by me<S>681</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto me, Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, the place<S>4725</S> of my throne<S>3678</S>, and the place<S>4725</S> of the soles<S>3709</S> of my feet<S>7272</S>, where I will dwell<S>7931</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> for ever<S>5769</S>, and my holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>, shall the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> no more defile<S>2930</S>, neither they, nor their kings<S>4428</S>, by their whoredom<S>2184</S>, nor by the carcases<S>6297</S> of their kings<S>4428</S> in their high places<S>1116</S>.
In their setting<S>5414</S> of their threshold<S>5592</S> by my thresholds<S>5592</S>, and their post<S>4201</S> by<S>681</S> my posts<S>4201</S>, and the wall<S>7023</S> between me and them, they have even defiled<S>2930</S> my holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S> by their abominations<S>8441</S> that they have committed<S>6213</S>: wherefore I have consumed<S>3615</S> them in mine anger<S>639</S>. <sup>and the: or, for there was but a wall between me and them</sup>
Now let them put away<S>7368</S> their whoredom<S>2184</S>, and the carcases<S>6297</S> of their kings<S>4428</S>, far<S>7368</S> from me, and I will dwell<S>7931</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of them for ever<S>5769</S>.
Thou son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, shew<S>5046</S> the house<S>1004</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that they may be ashamed<S>3637</S> of their iniquities<S>5771</S>: and let them measure<S>4058</S> the pattern<S>8508</S>. <sup>pattern: or, sum, or, number</sup>
And if they be ashamed<S>3637</S> of all that they have done<S>6213</S>, shew<S>3045</S> them the form<S>6699</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, and the fashion<S>8498</S> thereof, and the goings out<S>4161</S> thereof, and the comings<S>4126</S> in thereof, and all the forms<S>6699</S> thereof, and all the ordinances<S>2708</S> thereof, and all the forms<S>6699</S> thereof, and all the laws<S>8451</S> thereof: and write<S>3789</S> it in their sight<S>5869</S>, that they may keep<S>8104</S> the whole form<S>6699</S> thereof, and all the ordinances<S>2708</S> thereof, and do<S>6213</S> them.
This is the law<S>8451</S> of the house<S>1004</S>; Upon the top<S>7218</S> of the mountain<S>2022</S> the whole limit<S>1366</S> thereof round about<S>5439</S> shall be most<S>6944</S> holy<S>6944</S>. Behold, this is the law<S>8451</S> of the house<S>1004</S>.
And these are the measures<S>4060</S> of the altar<S>4196</S> after the cubits<S>520</S>: The cubit<S>520</S> is a cubit<S>520</S> and an hand breadth<S>2948</S>; even the bottom<S>2436</S> shall be a cubit<S>520</S>, and the breadth<S>7341</S> a cubit<S>520</S>, and the border<S>1366</S> thereof by the edge<S>8193</S> thereof round about<S>5439</S> shall be a<S>259</S> span<S>2239</S>: and this shall be the higher place<S>1354</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>. <sup>bottom: Heb. bosom</sup> <sup>edge: Heb. lip</sup>

And the altar<S>741</S> shall be twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> cubits long<S>753</S>, twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> broad<S>7341</S>, square<S>7251</S> in the four<S>702</S> squares<S>7253</S> thereof.
And the settle<S>5835</S> shall be fourteen<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> cubits long<S>753</S> and fourteen<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> broad<S>7341</S> in the four<S>702</S> squares<S>7253</S> thereof; and the border<S>1366</S> about<S>5439</S> it shall be half<S>2677</S> a cubit<S>520</S>; and the bottom<S>2436</S> thereof shall be a cubit<S>520</S> about<S>5439</S>; and his stairs<S>4609</S> shall look<S>6437</S> toward the east<S>6921</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto me, Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; These are the ordinances<S>2708</S> of the altar<S>4196</S> in the day<S>3117</S> when they shall make<S>6213</S> it, to offer<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> thereon, and to sprinkle<S>2236</S> blood<S>1818</S> thereon.
And thou shalt give<S>5414</S> to the priests<S>3548</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> that be of the seed<S>2233</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S>, which approach<S>7138</S> unto me, to minister<S>8334</S> unto me, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, a young<S>1121</S> <S>1241</S> bullock<S>6499</S> for a sin offering<S>2403</S>.
And thou shalt take<S>3947</S> of the blood<S>1818</S> thereof, and put<S>5414</S> it on the four<S>702</S> horns<S>7161</S> of it, and on the four<S>702</S> corners<S>6438</S> of the settle<S>5835</S>, and upon the border<S>1366</S> round about<S>5439</S>: thus shalt thou cleanse<S>2398</S> and purge<S>3722</S> it.
Thou shalt take<S>3947</S> the bullock<S>6499</S> also of the sin offering<S>2403</S>, and he shall burn<S>8313</S> it in the appointed place<S>4662</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, without<S>2351</S> the sanctuary<S>4720</S>.
And on the second<S>8145</S> day<S>3117</S> thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> a kid<S>8163</S> of the goats<S>5795</S> without blemish<S>8549</S> for a sin offering<S>2403</S>; and they shall cleanse<S>2398</S> the altar<S>4196</S>, as they did cleanse<S>2398</S> it with the bullock<S>6499</S>.
When thou hast made an end<S>3615</S> of cleansing<S>2398</S> it, thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> a young<S>1121</S> <S>1241</S> bullock<S>6499</S> without blemish<S>8549</S>, and a ram<S>352</S> out of the flock<S>6629</S> without blemish<S>8549</S>.
And thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> them before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> shall cast<S>7993</S> salt<S>4417</S> upon them, and they shall offer them up<S>5927</S> for a burnt offering<S>5930</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> shalt thou prepare<S>6213</S> every day<S>3117</S> a goat<S>8163</S> for a sin offering<S>2403</S>: they shall also prepare<S>6213</S> a young<S>1121</S> <S>1241</S> bullock<S>6499</S>, and a ram<S>352</S> out of the flock<S>6629</S>, without blemish<S>8549</S>.

Now Jericho<S>3405</S> was straitly<S>5462</S> shut up<S>5462</S> because<S>6440</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: none went out<S>3318</S>, and none came in<S>935</S>. <sup>was: Heb. did shut up, and was shut up</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, See<S>7200</S>, I have given<S>5414</S> into thine hand<S>3027</S> Jericho<S>3405</S>, and the king<S>4428</S> thereof, and the mighty men<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S>.
And ye shall compass<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S>, all ye men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and go round about<S>5362</S> the city<S>5892</S> once<S>6471</S> <S>259</S>. Thus shalt thou do<S>6213</S> six<S>8337</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And seven<S>7651</S> priests<S>3548</S> shall bear<S>5375</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> seven<S>7651</S> trumpets<S>7782</S> of rams' horns<S>3104</S>: and the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> ye shall compass<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> shall blow<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>.
And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long<S>4900</S> blast with the ram's<S>3104</S> horn<S>7161</S>, and when ye hear<S>8085</S> the sound<S>6963</S> of the trumpet<S>7782</S>, all the people<S>5971</S> shall shout<S>7321</S> with a great<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S>; and the wall<S>2346</S> of the city<S>5892</S> shall fall down<S>5307</S> flat<S>8478</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> shall ascend up<S>5927</S> every man<S>376</S> straight before him. <sup>flat: Heb. under it</sup>
And Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S> called<S>7121</S> the priests<S>3548</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Take up<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, and let seven<S>7651</S> priests<S>3548</S> bear<S>5375</S> seven<S>7651</S> trumpets<S>7782</S> of rams' horns<S>3104</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Pass on<S>5674</S>, and compass<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and let him that is armed<S>2502</S> pass on<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And it came to pass, when Joshua<S>3091</S> had spoken<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, that the seven<S>7651</S> priests<S>3548</S> bearing<S>5375</S> the seven<S>7651</S> trumpets<S>7782</S> of rams' horns<S>3104</S> passed on<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and blew<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>: and the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> followed<S>1980</S> them<S>310</S>.
And the armed<S>2502</S> men went<S>1980</S> before<S>6440</S> the priests<S>3548</S> that blew<S>8628</S> <S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>, and the rereward<S>622</S> came<S>1980</S> after<S>310</S> the ark<S>727</S>, the priests going on<S>1980</S>, and blowing<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>. <sup>rereward: Heb. gathering host</sup>
And Joshua<S>3091</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> the people<S>5971</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Ye shall not shout<S>7321</S>, nor make any noise<S>8085</S> with your voice<S>6963</S>, neither shall any word<S>1697</S> proceed<S>3318</S> out of your mouth<S>6310</S>, until the day<S>3117</S> I bid<S>559</S> you shout<S>7321</S>; then shall ye shout<S>7321</S>. <sup>any noise: Heb. your voice to be heard</sup>
So the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> compassed<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S>, going about<S>5362</S> it once<S>6471</S> <S>259</S>: and they came<S>935</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>, and lodged<S>3885</S> in the camp<S>4264</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> rose early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> took up<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And seven<S>7651</S> priests<S>3548</S> bearing<S>5375</S> seven<S>7651</S> trumpets<S>7782</S> of rams' horns<S>3104</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> went on<S>1980</S> continually<S>1980</S>, and blew<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>: and the armed men<S>2502</S> went<S>1980</S> before<S>6440</S> them; but the rereward<S>622</S> came<S>1980</S> after<S>310</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, the priests going on<S>1980</S>, and blowing<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>.
And the second<S>8145</S> day<S>3117</S> they compassed<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> once<S>6471</S> <S>259</S>, and returned<S>7725</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>: so they did<S>6213</S> six<S>8337</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And it came to pass on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, that they rose early<S>7925</S> about the dawning<S>5927</S> of the day<S>7837</S>, and compassed<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> after the same manner<S>4941</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>: only on that day<S>3117</S> they compassed<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>.
And it came to pass at the seventh<S>7637</S> time<S>6471</S>, when the priests<S>3548</S> blew<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>, Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Shout<S>7321</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> you the city<S>5892</S>.
And the city<S>5892</S> shall be accursed<S>2764</S>, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD<S>3068</S>: only Rahab<S>7343</S> the harlot<S>2181</S> shall live<S>2421</S>, she and all that are with her in the house<S>1004</S>, because she hid<S>2244</S> the messengers<S>4397</S> that we sent<S>7971</S>. <sup>accursed: or, devoted</sup>
And ye, in any wise<S>7535</S> keep<S>8104</S> yourselves from the accursed thing<S>2764</S>, lest ye make yourselves accursed<S>2763</S>, when ye take<S>3947</S> of the accursed thing<S>2764</S>, and make<S>7760</S> the camp<S>4264</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> a curse<S>2764</S>, and trouble<S>5916</S> it. <sup>accursed: or, devoted</sup> <sup>a curse: or, devoted</sup>
But all the silver<S>3701</S>, and gold<S>2091</S>, and vessels<S>3627</S> of brass<S>5178</S> and iron<S>1270</S>, are consecrated<S>6944</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: they shall come<S>935</S> into the treasury<S>214</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>consecrated: Heb. holiness</sup>
So the people<S>5971</S> shouted<S>7321</S> when the priests blew<S>8628</S> with the trumpets<S>7782</S>: and it came to pass, when the people<S>5971</S> heard<S>8085</S> the sound<S>6963</S> of the trumpet<S>7782</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> shouted<S>7321</S> with a great<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S>, that the wall<S>2346</S> fell down flat<S>5307</S>, so that the people<S>5971</S> went up<S>5927</S> into the city<S>5892</S>, every man<S>376</S> straight before him, and they took<S>3920</S> the city<S>5892</S>. <sup>flat: Heb. under it</sup>
And they utterly destroyed<S>2763</S> all that was in the city<S>5892</S>, both man<S>376</S> and woman<S>802</S>, young<S>5288</S> and old<S>2205</S>, and ox<S>7794</S>, and sheep<S>7716</S>, and ass<S>2543</S>, with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>.
But Joshua<S>3091</S> had said<S>559</S> unto the two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> that had spied out<S>7270</S> the country<S>776</S>, Go<S>935</S> into the harlot's<S>2181</S> house<S>1004</S>, and bring out<S>3318</S> thence the woman<S>802</S>, and all that she hath, as ye sware<S>7650</S> unto her.
And the young men<S>5288</S> that were spies<S>7270</S> went in<S>935</S>, and brought out<S>3318</S> Rahab<S>7343</S>, and her father<S>1</S>, and her mother<S>517</S>, and her brethren<S>251</S>, and all that she had; and they brought out<S>3318</S> all her kindred<S>4940</S>, and left<S>3240</S> them without<S>2351</S> the camp<S>4264</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>kindred: Heb. families</sup>
And they burnt<S>8313</S> the city<S>5892</S> with fire<S>784</S>, and all that was therein: only the silver<S>3701</S>, and the gold<S>2091</S>, and the vessels<S>3627</S> of brass<S>5178</S> and of iron<S>1270</S>, they put<S>5414</S> into the treasury<S>214</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> saved<S>2421</S> Rahab<S>7343</S> the harlot<S>2181</S> alive<S>2421</S>, and her father's<S>1</S> household<S>1004</S>, and all that she had; and she dwelleth<S>3427</S> in<S>7130</S> Israel<S>3478</S> even unto this day<S>3117</S>; because she hid<S>2244</S> the messengers<S>4397</S>, which Joshua<S>3091</S> sent<S>7971</S> to spy out<S>7270</S> Jericho<S>3405</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> adjured<S>7650</S> them at that time<S>6256</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Cursed<S>779</S> be the man<S>376</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that riseth up<S>6965</S> and buildeth<S>1129</S> this city<S>5892</S> Jericho<S>3405</S>: he shall lay the foundation<S>3245</S> thereof in his firstborn<S>1060</S>, and in his youngest<S>6810</S> son shall he set up<S>5324</S> the gates<S>1817</S> of it.
So the LORD<S>3068</S> was with Joshua<S>3091</S>; and his fame<S>8089</S> was noised throughout all the country<S>776</S>.

The word<S>1697</S> that came to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Hear<S>8085</S> ye the words<S>1697</S> of this covenant<S>1285</S>, and speak<S>1696</S> unto the men<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and to the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>;
And say<S>559</S> thou unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Cursed<S>779</S> be the man<S>376</S> that obeyeth<S>8085</S> not the words<S>1697</S> of this covenant<S>1285</S>,
Which I commanded<S>6680</S> your fathers<S>1</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that I brought them forth<S>3318</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, from the iron<S>1270</S> furnace<S>3564</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Obey<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>, and do<S>6213</S> them, according to all which I command<S>6680</S> you: so shall ye be my people<S>5971</S>, and I will be your God<S>430</S>:
That I may perform<S>6965</S> the oath<S>7621</S> which I have sworn<S>7650</S> unto your fathers<S>1</S>, to give<S>5414</S> them a land<S>776</S> flowing<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>, as it is this day<S>3117</S>. Then answered<S>6030</S> I, and said<S>559</S>, So be it<S>543</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>So: Heb. Amen</sup>
Then the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Proclaim<S>7121</S> all these words<S>1697</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> ye the words<S>1697</S> of this covenant<S>1285</S>, and do<S>6213</S> them.
For I earnestly<S>5749</S> protested<S>5749</S> unto your fathers<S>1</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that I brought them up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, even unto this day<S>3117</S>, rising early<S>7925</S> and protesting<S>5749</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Obey<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>.
Yet they obeyed<S>8085</S> not, nor inclined<S>5186</S> their ear<S>241</S>, but walked<S>3212</S> every one<S>376</S> in the imagination<S>8307</S> of their evil<S>7451</S> heart<S>3820</S>: therefore I will bring<S>935</S> upon them all the words<S>1697</S> of this covenant<S>1285</S>, which I commanded<S>6680</S> them to do<S>6213</S>; but they did<S>6213</S> them not. <sup>imagination: or, stubbornness</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, A conspiracy<S>7195</S> is found<S>4672</S> among the men<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and among the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
They are turned back<S>7725</S> to the iniquities<S>5771</S> of their forefathers<S>7223</S> <S>1</S>, which refused<S>3985</S> to hear<S>8085</S> my words<S>1697</S>; and they went<S>1980</S> after<S>310</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S> to serve<S>5647</S> them: the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> have broken<S>6565</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> which I made<S>3772</S> with their fathers<S>1</S>.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Behold, I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon them, which they shall not be able<S>3201</S> to escape<S>3318</S>; and though they shall cry<S>2199</S> unto me, I will not hearken<S>8085</S> unto them. <sup>to escape: Heb. to go forth of</sup>
Then shall the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> go<S>1980</S>, and cry<S>2199</S> unto the gods<S>430</S> unto whom they offer incense<S>6999</S>: but they shall not save<S>3467</S> them at all<S>3467</S> in the time<S>6256</S> of their trouble<S>7451</S>. <sup>trouble: Heb. evil</sup>
For according to the number<S>4557</S> of thy cities<S>5892</S> were thy gods<S>430</S>, O Judah<S>3063</S>; and according to the number<S>4557</S> of the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> have ye set up<S>7760</S> altars<S>4196</S> to that shameful thing<S>1322</S>, even altars<S>4196</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S> unto Baal<S>1168</S>. <sup>shameful: Heb. shame</sup>
Therefore pray<S>6419</S> not thou for this people<S>5971</S>, neither lift up<S>5375</S> a cry<S>7440</S> or prayer<S>8605</S> for them: for I will not hear<S>8085</S> them in the time<S>6256</S> that they cry<S>7121</S> unto me for their trouble<S>7451</S>. <sup>trouble: Heb. evil</sup>

The LORD<S>3068</S> called<S>7121</S> thy name<S>8034</S>, A green<S>7488</S> olive tree<S>2132</S>, fair<S>3303</S>, and of goodly<S>8389</S> fruit<S>6529</S>: with the noise<S>6963</S> of a great<S>1419</S> tumult<S>1999</S> he hath kindled<S>3341</S> fire<S>784</S> upon it, and the branches<S>1808</S> of it are broken<S>7489</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, that planted<S>5193</S> thee, hath pronounced<S>1696</S> evil<S>7451</S> against thee, for<S>1558</S> the evil<S>7451</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and of the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, which they have done<S>6213</S> against themselves to provoke me to anger<S>3707</S> in offering incense<S>6999</S> unto Baal<S>1168</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given me knowledge<S>3045</S> of it, and I know<S>3045</S> it: then thou shewedst<S>7200</S> me their doings<S>4611</S>.
But I was like a lamb<S>3532</S> or an ox<S>441</S> that is brought<S>2986</S> to the slaughter<S>2873</S>; and I knew<S>3045</S> not that they had devised<S>2803</S> devices<S>4284</S> against me, saying, Let us destroy<S>7843</S> the tree<S>6086</S> with the fruit<S>3899</S> thereof, and let us cut him off<S>3772</S> from the land<S>776</S> of the living<S>2416</S>, that his name<S>8034</S> may be no more remembered<S>2142</S>. <sup>the tree: Heb. the stalk with his bread</sup>
But, O LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, that judgest<S>8199</S> righteously<S>6664</S>, that triest<S>974</S> the reins<S>3629</S> and the heart<S>3820</S>, let me see<S>7200</S> thy vengeance<S>5360</S> on them: for unto thee have I revealed<S>1540</S> my cause<S>7379</S>.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of the men<S>582</S> of Anathoth<S>6068</S>, that seek<S>1245</S> thy life<S>5315</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Prophesy<S>5012</S> not in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that thou die<S>4191</S> not by our hand<S>3027</S>:
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, Behold, I will punish<S>6485</S> them: the young men<S>970</S> shall die<S>4191</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>; their sons<S>1121</S> and their daughters<S>1323</S> shall die<S>4191</S> by famine<S>7458</S>: <sup>punish: Heb. visit upon</sup>
And there shall be no remnant<S>7611</S> of them: for I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon the men<S>582</S> of Anathoth<S>6068</S>, even the year<S>8141</S> of their visitation<S>6486</S>.

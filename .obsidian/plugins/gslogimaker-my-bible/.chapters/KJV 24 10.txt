Hear<S>8085</S> ye the word<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> speaketh<S>1696</S> unto you, O house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Learn<S>3925</S> not the way<S>1870</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>, and be not dismayed<S>2865</S> at the signs<S>226</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>; for the heathen<S>1471</S> are dismayed<S>2865</S> at them<S>1992</S>.
For the customs<S>2708</S> of the people<S>5971</S> are vain<S>1892</S>: for one cutteth<S>3772</S> a tree<S>6086</S> out of the forest<S>3293</S>, the work<S>4639</S> of the hands<S>3027</S> of the workman<S>2796</S>, with the axe<S>4621</S>. <sup>customs: Heb. statutes, or, ordinances are vanity</sup>
They deck<S>3302</S> it with silver<S>3701</S> and with gold<S>2091</S>; they fasten<S>2388</S> it with nails<S>4548</S> and with hammers<S>4717</S>, that it move<S>6328</S> not.
They are upright<S>4749</S> as the palm tree<S>8560</S>, but speak<S>1696</S> not: they must needs<S>5375</S> be borne<S>5375</S>, because they cannot go<S>6805</S>. Be not afraid<S>3372</S> of them; for they cannot do evil<S>7489</S>, neither also is it in them to do good<S>3190</S>.
Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD<S>3068</S>; thou art great<S>1419</S>, and thy name<S>8034</S> is great<S>1419</S> in might<S>1369</S>.
Who would not fear<S>3372</S> thee, O King<S>4428</S> of nations<S>1471</S>? for to thee doth it appertain<S>2969</S>: forasmuch as among all the wise<S>2450</S> men of the nations<S>1471</S>, and in all their kingdoms<S>4438</S>, there is none like unto thee. <sup>to: or, it liketh thee</sup>
But they are altogether<S>259</S> brutish<S>1197</S> and foolish<S>3688</S>: the stock<S>6086</S> is a doctrine<S>4148</S> of vanities<S>1892</S>. <sup>altogether: Heb. in one, or, at once</sup>
Silver<S>3701</S> spread into plates<S>7554</S> is brought<S>935</S> from Tarshish<S>8659</S>, and gold<S>2091</S> from Uphaz<S>210</S>, the work<S>4639</S> of the workman<S>2796</S>, and of the hands<S>3027</S> of the founder<S>6884</S>: blue<S>8504</S> and purple<S>713</S> is their clothing<S>3830</S>: they are all the work<S>4639</S> of cunning<S>2450</S> men.
But the LORD<S>3068</S> is the true<S>571</S> God<S>430</S>, he is the living<S>2416</S> God<S>430</S>, and an everlasting<S>5769</S> king<S>4428</S>: at his wrath<S>7110</S> the earth<S>776</S> shall tremble<S>7493</S>, and the nations<S>1471</S> shall not be able to abide<S>3557</S> his indignation<S>2195</S>. <sup>true: Heb. God of truth</sup> <sup>everlasting: Heb. king of eternity</sup>
Thus<S>1836</S> shall ye say<S>560</S> unto them, The gods<S>426</S> that have not<S>3809</S> made<S>5648</S> the heavens<S>8065</S> and the earth<S>778</S>, even they shall perish<S>7</S> from the earth<S>772</S>, and from under<S>8460</S> these<S>429</S> heavens<S>8065</S>.
He hath made<S>6213</S> the earth<S>776</S> by his power<S>3581</S>, he hath established<S>3559</S> the world<S>8398</S> by his wisdom<S>2451</S>, and hath stretched out<S>5186</S> the heavens<S>8064</S> by his discretion<S>8394</S>.
When he uttereth<S>5414</S> his voice<S>6963</S>, there is a multitude<S>1995</S> of waters<S>4325</S> in the heavens<S>8064</S>, and he causeth the vapours<S>5387</S> to ascend<S>5927</S> from the ends<S>7097</S> of the earth<S>776</S>; he maketh<S>6213</S> lightnings<S>1300</S> with rain<S>4306</S>, and bringeth forth<S>3318</S> the wind<S>7307</S> out of his treasures<S>214</S>. <sup>multitude: or, noise</sup> <sup>with: or, for</sup>
Every man<S>120</S> is brutish<S>1197</S> in his knowledge<S>1847</S>: every founder<S>6884</S> is confounded<S>3001</S> by the graven image<S>6459</S>: for his molten image<S>5262</S> is falsehood<S>8267</S>, and there is no breath<S>7307</S> in them. <sup>brutish in his knowledge: or, more brutish than to know</sup>
They are vanity<S>1892</S>, and the work<S>4639</S> of errors<S>8595</S>: in the time<S>6256</S> of their visitation<S>6486</S> they shall perish<S>6</S>.
The portion<S>2506</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> is not like them: for he is the former<S>3335</S> of all things; and Israel<S>3478</S> is the rod<S>7626</S> of his inheritance<S>5159</S>: The LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> is his name<S>8034</S>.
Gather up<S>622</S> thy wares<S>3666</S> out of the land<S>776</S>, O inhabitant<S>3427</S> of the fortress<S>4692</S>. <sup>inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress</sup>
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Behold, I will sling<S>7049</S> out the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the land<S>776</S> at this once<S>6471</S>, and will distress<S>6887</S> them, that they may find<S>4672</S> it so.
Woe<S>188</S> is me for my hurt<S>7667</S>! my wound<S>4347</S> is grievous<S>2470</S>: but I said<S>559</S>, Truly<S>389</S> this is a grief<S>2483</S>, and I must bear<S>5375</S> it.
My tabernacle<S>168</S> is spoiled<S>7703</S>, and all my cords<S>4340</S> are broken<S>5423</S>: my children<S>1121</S> are gone forth<S>3318</S> of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth<S>5186</S> my tent<S>168</S> any more, and to set up<S>6965</S> my curtains<S>3407</S>.
For the pastors<S>7462</S> are become brutish<S>1197</S>, and have not sought<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: therefore they shall not prosper<S>7919</S>, and all their flocks<S>4830</S> shall be scattered<S>6327</S>.
Behold, the noise<S>6963</S> of the bruit<S>8052</S> is come<S>935</S>, and a great<S>1419</S> commotion<S>7494</S> out of the north<S>6828</S> country<S>776</S>, to make<S>7760</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> desolate<S>8077</S>, and a den<S>4583</S> of dragons<S>8577</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that the way<S>1870</S> of man<S>120</S> is not in himself: it is not in man<S>376</S> that walketh<S>1980</S> to direct<S>3559</S> his steps<S>6806</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, correct<S>3256</S> me, but with judgment<S>4941</S>; not in thine anger<S>639</S>, lest thou bring me to nothing<S>4591</S>. <sup>bring: Heb. diminish me</sup>
Pour out<S>8210</S> thy fury<S>2534</S> upon the heathen<S>1471</S> that know<S>3045</S> thee not, and upon the families<S>4940</S> that call<S>7121</S> not on thy name<S>8034</S>: for they have eaten up<S>398</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>, and devoured<S>398</S> him, and consumed<S>3615</S> him, and have made his habitation<S>5116</S> desolate<S>8074</S>.

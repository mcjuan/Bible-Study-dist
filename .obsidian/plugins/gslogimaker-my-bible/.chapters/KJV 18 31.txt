I made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with mine eyes<S>5869</S>; why then should I think<S>995</S> upon a maid<S>1330</S>?
For what portion<S>2506</S> of God<S>433</S> is there from above<S>4605</S>? and what inheritance<S>5159</S> of the Almighty<S>7706</S> from on high<S>4791</S>?
Is not destruction<S>343</S> to the wicked<S>5767</S>? and a strange<S>5235</S> punishment to the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S>?
Doth not he see<S>7200</S> my ways<S>1870</S>, and count<S>5608</S> all my steps<S>6806</S>?
If I have walked<S>1980</S> with vanity<S>7723</S>, or if my foot<S>7272</S> hath hasted<S>2363</S> to deceit<S>4820</S>;
Let me be weighed<S>8254</S> in an even<S>6664</S> balance<S>3976</S>, that God<S>433</S> may know<S>3045</S> mine integrity<S>8538</S>. <sup>Let: Heb. Let him weigh me in balances of justice</sup>
If my step<S>838</S> hath turned out<S>5186</S> of the way<S>1870</S>, and mine heart<S>3820</S> walked<S>1980</S> after<S>310</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and if any blot<S>3971</S> hath cleaved<S>1692</S> to mine hands<S>3709</S>;
Then let me sow<S>2232</S>, and let another<S>312</S> eat<S>398</S>; yea, let my offspring<S>6631</S> be rooted out<S>8327</S>.
If mine heart<S>3820</S> have been deceived<S>6601</S> by a woman<S>802</S>, or if I have laid wait<S>693</S> at my neighbour's<S>7453</S> door<S>6607</S>;
Then let my wife<S>802</S> grind<S>2912</S> unto another<S>312</S>, and let others<S>312</S> bow down<S>3766</S> upon her.
For this is an heinous crime<S>2154</S>; yea, it is an iniquity<S>5771</S> to be punished by the judges<S>6414</S>.
For it is a fire<S>784</S> that consumeth<S>398</S> to destruction<S>11</S>, and would root out<S>8327</S> all mine increase<S>8393</S>.
If I did despise<S>3988</S> the cause<S>4941</S> of my manservant<S>5650</S> or of my maidservant<S>519</S>, when they contended<S>7379</S> with me;
What then shall I do<S>6213</S> when God<S>410</S> riseth up<S>6965</S>? and when he visiteth<S>6485</S>, what shall I answer<S>7725</S> him?
Did not he that made<S>6213</S> me in the womb<S>990</S> make<S>6213</S> him? and did not one<S>259</S> fashion<S>3559</S> us in the womb<S>7358</S>? <sup>did not one: or, did he not fashion us in one womb?</sup>
If I have withheld<S>4513</S> the poor<S>1800</S> from their desire<S>2656</S>, or have caused the eyes<S>5869</S> of the widow<S>490</S> to fail<S>3615</S>;
Or have eaten<S>398</S> my morsel<S>6595</S> myself alone, and the fatherless<S>3490</S> hath not eaten<S>398</S> thereof;
(For from my youth<S>5271</S> he was brought up<S>1431</S> with me, as with a father<S>1</S>, and I have guided<S>5148</S> her from my mother's<S>517</S> womb<S>990</S>;) <sup>her: that is, the widow</sup>
If I have seen<S>7200</S> any perish<S>6</S> for want of clothing<S>3830</S>, or any poor<S>34</S> without covering<S>3682</S>;
If his loins<S>2504</S> have not blessed<S>1288</S> me, and if he were not warmed<S>2552</S> with the fleece<S>1488</S> of my sheep<S>3532</S>;
If I have lifted up<S>5130</S> my hand<S>3027</S> against the fatherless<S>3490</S>, when I saw<S>7200</S> my help<S>5833</S> in the gate<S>8179</S>:
Then let mine arm<S>3802</S> fall<S>5307</S> from my shoulder blade<S>7929</S>, and mine arm<S>248</S> be broken<S>7665</S> from the bone<S>7070</S>. <sup>bone: or, chanelbone</sup>
For destruction<S>343</S> from God<S>410</S> was a terror<S>6343</S> to me, and by reason of his highness<S>7613</S> I could<S>3201</S> not endure.
If I have made<S>7760</S> gold<S>2091</S> my hope<S>3689</S>, or have said<S>559</S> to the fine gold<S>3800</S>, Thou art my confidence<S>4009</S>;
If I rejoiced<S>8055</S> because my wealth<S>2428</S> was great<S>7227</S>, and because mine hand<S>3027</S> had gotten<S>4672</S> much<S>3524</S>; <sup>gotten: Heb. found much</sup>
If I beheld<S>7200</S> the sun<S>216</S> when it shined<S>1984</S>, or the moon<S>3394</S> walking<S>1980</S> in brightness<S>3368</S>; <sup>sun: Heb. light</sup> <sup>in: Heb. bright</sup>
And my heart<S>3820</S> hath been secretly<S>5643</S> enticed<S>6601</S>, or my mouth<S>6310</S> hath kissed<S>5401</S> my hand<S>3027</S>: <sup>my mouth: Heb. my hand hath kissed my mouth</sup>
This also were an iniquity<S>5771</S> to be punished by the judge<S>6416</S>: for I should have denied<S>3584</S> the God<S>410</S> that is above<S>4605</S>.
If I rejoiced<S>8055</S> at the destruction<S>6365</S> of him that hated<S>8130</S> me, or lifted up<S>5782</S> myself when evil<S>7451</S> found<S>4672</S> him:
Neither have I suffered<S>5414</S> my mouth<S>2441</S> to sin<S>2398</S> by wishing<S>7592</S> a curse<S>423</S> to his soul<S>5315</S>. <sup>mouth: Heb. palate</sup>

The stranger<S>1616</S> did not lodge<S>3885</S> in the street<S>2351</S>: but I opened<S>6605</S> my doors<S>1817</S> to the traveller<S>734</S>. <sup>traveller: or, way</sup>

Did I fear<S>6206</S> a great<S>7227</S> multitude<S>1995</S>, or did the contempt<S>937</S> of families<S>4940</S> terrify<S>2865</S> me, that I kept silence<S>1826</S>, and went not out<S>3318</S> of the door<S>6607</S>?
Oh that<S>5414</S> one would hear<S>8085</S> me! behold, my desire<S>8420</S> is, that the Almighty<S>7706</S> would answer<S>6030</S> me, and that mine adversary<S>376</S> <S>7379</S> had written<S>3789</S> a book<S>5612</S>. <sup>my: or, my sign is that the Almighty will</sup>

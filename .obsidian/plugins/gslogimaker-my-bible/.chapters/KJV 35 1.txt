The burden<S>4853</S> which Habakkuk<S>2265</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> did see<S>2372</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, how long shall I cry<S>7768</S>, and thou wilt not hear<S>8085</S>! even cry out<S>2199</S> unto thee of violence<S>2555</S>, and thou wilt not save<S>3467</S>!
Why dost thou shew<S>7200</S> me iniquity<S>205</S>, and cause me to behold<S>5027</S> grievance<S>5999</S>? for spoiling<S>7701</S> and violence<S>2555</S> are before me: and there are that raise up<S>5375</S> strife<S>7379</S> and contention<S>4066</S>.
Therefore the law<S>8451</S> is slacked<S>6313</S>, and judgment<S>4941</S> doth never<S>5331</S> go forth<S>3318</S>: for the wicked<S>7563</S> doth compass<S>3803</S> about the righteous<S>6662</S>; therefore wrong<S>6127</S> judgment<S>4941</S> proceedeth<S>3318</S>. <sup>wrong: or, wrested</sup>
Behold<S>7200</S> ye among the heathen<S>1471</S>, and regard<S>5027</S>, and wonder<S>8539</S> marvellously<S>8539</S>: for I will work<S>6466</S> a work<S>6467</S> in your days<S>3117</S>, which ye will not believe<S>539</S>, though it be told<S>5608</S> you.
For, lo, I raise up<S>6965</S> the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>, that bitter<S>4751</S> and hasty<S>4116</S> nation<S>1471</S>, which shall march<S>1980</S> through the breadth<S>4800</S> of the land<S>776</S>, to possess<S>3423</S> the dwellingplaces<S>4908</S> that are not theirs. <sup>breadth: Heb. breadths</sup>
They are terrible<S>366</S> and dreadful<S>3372</S>: their judgment<S>4941</S> and their dignity<S>7613</S> shall proceed<S>3318</S> of themselves. <sup>their judgment: or, from them shall proceed the judgment of these, and the captivity of these</sup>
Their horses<S>5483</S> also are swifter<S>7043</S> than the leopards<S>5246</S>, and are more fierce<S>2300</S> than the evening<S>6153</S> wolves<S>2061</S>: and their horsemen<S>6571</S> shall spread<S>6335</S> themselves, and their horsemen<S>6571</S> shall come<S>935</S> from far<S>7350</S>; they shall fly<S>5774</S> as the eagle<S>5404</S> that hasteth<S>2363</S> to eat<S>398</S>. <sup>fierce: Heb. sharp</sup>
They shall come<S>935</S> all for violence<S>2555</S>: their faces<S>6440</S> shall sup up<S>4041</S> as the east wind<S>6921</S>, and they shall gather<S>622</S> the captivity<S>7628</S> as the sand<S>2344</S>. <sup>their: or, the supping up of their faces, etc: or, their faces shall look (Heb. the opposition of their faces) toward the east</sup>
And they shall scoff<S>7046</S> at the kings<S>4428</S>, and the princes<S>7336</S> shall be a scorn<S>4890</S> unto them: they shall deride<S>7832</S> every strong hold<S>4013</S>; for they shall heap<S>6651</S> dust<S>6083</S>, and take<S>3920</S> it.
Then shall his mind<S>7307</S> change<S>2498</S>, and he shall pass over<S>5674</S>, and offend<S>816</S>, imputing this<S>2098</S> his power<S>3581</S> unto his god<S>433</S>.
Art thou not from everlasting<S>6924</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> my God<S>430</S>, mine Holy One<S>6918</S>? we shall not die<S>4191</S>. O LORD<S>3068</S>, thou hast ordained<S>7760</S> them for judgment<S>4941</S>; and, O mighty God<S>6697</S>, thou hast established<S>3245</S> them for correction<S>3198</S>. <sup>mighty: Heb. rock. established: Heb. founded</sup>
Thou art of purer<S>2889</S> eyes<S>5869</S> than to behold<S>7200</S> evil<S>7451</S>, and canst<S>3201</S> not look<S>5027</S> on iniquity<S>5999</S>: wherefore lookest<S>5027</S> thou upon them that deal treacherously<S>898</S>, and holdest thy tongue<S>2790</S> when the wicked<S>7563</S> devoureth<S>1104</S> the man that is more righteous<S>6662</S> than he? <sup>iniquity: or, grievance</sup>
And makest<S>6213</S> men<S>120</S> as the fishes<S>1709</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>, as the creeping things<S>7431</S>, that have no ruler<S>4910</S> over them? <sup>creeping: or, moving</sup>
They take up<S>5927</S> all of them with the angle<S>2443</S>, they catch<S>1641</S> them in their net<S>2764</S>, and gather<S>622</S> them in their drag<S>4365</S>: therefore they rejoice<S>8055</S> and are glad<S>1523</S>. <sup>drag: or, flue net</sup>
Therefore they sacrifice<S>2076</S> unto their net<S>2764</S>, and burn incense<S>6999</S> unto their drag<S>4365</S>; because by them<S>1992</S> their portion<S>2506</S> is fat<S>8082</S>, and their meat<S>3978</S> plenteous<S>1277</S>. <sup>plenteous: or, dainty: Heb. fat</sup>
Shall they therefore empty<S>7324</S> their net<S>2764</S>, and not spare<S>2550</S> continually<S>8548</S> to slay<S>2026</S> the nations<S>1471</S>?

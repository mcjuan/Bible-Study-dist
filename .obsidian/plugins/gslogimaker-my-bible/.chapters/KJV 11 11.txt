But king<S>4428</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> loved<S>157</S> many<S>7227</S> strange<S>5237</S> women<S>802</S>, together with the daughter<S>1323</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, women of the Moabites<S>4125</S>, Ammonites<S>5984</S>, Edomites<S>130</S>, Zidonians<S>6722</S>, and Hittites<S>2850</S>; <sup>together: or, beside</sup>
Of the nations<S>1471</S> concerning which the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Ye shall not go in<S>935</S> to them, neither shall they come in<S>935</S> unto you: for surely<S>403</S> they will turn away<S>5186</S> your heart<S>3824</S> after<S>310</S> their gods<S>430</S>: Solomon<S>8010</S> clave<S>1692</S> unto these in love<S>157</S>.
And he had seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> wives<S>802</S>, princesses<S>8282</S>, and three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> concubines<S>6370</S>: and his wives<S>802</S> turned away<S>5186</S> his heart<S>3820</S>.
For it came to pass, when<S>6256</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> was old<S>2209</S>, that his wives<S>802</S> turned away<S>5186</S> his heart<S>3824</S> after<S>310</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>: and his heart<S>3824</S> was not perfect<S>8003</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, as was the heart<S>3824</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>.
For Solomon<S>8010</S> went<S>3212</S> after<S>310</S> Ashtoreth<S>6253</S> the goddess<S>430</S> of the Zidonians<S>6722</S>, and after<S>310</S> Milcom<S>4445</S> the abomination<S>8251</S> of the Ammonites<S>5984</S>.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and went not fully<S>4390</S> after<S>310</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, as did David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>. <sup>went: Heb. fulfilled not after</sup>
Then did Solomon<S>8010</S> build<S>1129</S> an high place<S>1116</S> for Chemosh<S>3645</S>, the abomination<S>8251</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, in the hill<S>2022</S> that is before<S>6440</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and for Molech<S>4432</S>, the abomination<S>8251</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>.
And likewise did<S>6213</S> he for all his strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S>, which burnt incense<S>6999</S> and sacrificed<S>2076</S> unto their gods<S>430</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was angry<S>599</S> with Solomon<S>8010</S>, because his heart<S>3824</S> was turned<S>5186</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which had appeared<S>7200</S> unto him twice<S>6471</S>,
And had commanded<S>6680</S> him concerning this thing<S>1697</S>, that he should not go<S>3212</S> after<S>310</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>: but he kept<S>8104</S> not that which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>.
Wherefore the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Solomon<S>8010</S>, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept<S>8104</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> and my statutes<S>2708</S>, which I have commanded<S>6680</S> thee, I will surely<S>7167</S> rend<S>7167</S> the kingdom<S>4467</S> from thee, and will give<S>5414</S> it to thy servant<S>5650</S>. <sup>is done: Heb. is with thee</sup>
Notwithstanding in thy days<S>3117</S> I will not do<S>6213</S> it for David<S>1732</S> thy father's<S>1</S> sake: but I will rend<S>7167</S> it out of the hand<S>3027</S> of thy son<S>1121</S>.
Howbeit<S>7535</S> I will not rend away<S>7167</S> all the kingdom<S>4467</S>; but will give<S>5414</S> one<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S> to thy son<S>1121</S> for David<S>1732</S> my servant's<S>5650</S> sake, and for Jerusalem's<S>3389</S> sake which I have chosen<S>977</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> stirred up<S>6965</S> an adversary<S>7854</S> unto Solomon<S>8010</S>, Hadad<S>1908</S> the Edomite<S>130</S>: he was of the king's<S>4428</S> seed<S>2233</S> in Edom<S>123</S>.
For it came to pass, when David<S>1732</S> was in Edom<S>123</S>, and Joab<S>3097</S> the captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S> was gone up<S>5927</S> to bury<S>6912</S> the slain<S>2491</S>, after he had smitten<S>5221</S> every male<S>2145</S> in Edom<S>123</S>;
(For six<S>8337</S> months<S>2320</S> did Joab<S>3097</S> remain<S>3427</S> there with all Israel<S>3478</S>, until he had cut off<S>3772</S> every male<S>2145</S> in Edom<S>123</S>:)
That Hadad<S>111</S> fled<S>1272</S>, he and certain<S>582</S> Edomites<S>130</S> of his father's<S>1</S> servants<S>5650</S> with him, to go<S>935</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>; Hadad<S>1908</S> being yet a little<S>6996</S> child<S>5288</S>.
And they arose<S>6965</S> out of Midian<S>4080</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Paran<S>6290</S>: and they took<S>3947</S> men<S>582</S> with them out of Paran<S>6290</S>, and they came<S>935</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S>, unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; which gave<S>5414</S> him an house<S>1004</S>, and appointed<S>559</S> him victuals<S>3899</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> him land<S>776</S>.
And Hadad<S>1908</S> found<S>4672</S> great<S>3966</S> favour<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, so that he gave<S>5414</S> him to wife<S>802</S> the sister<S>269</S> of his own wife<S>802</S>, the sister<S>269</S> of Tahpenes<S>8472</S> the queen<S>1377</S>.
And the sister<S>269</S> of Tahpenes<S>8472</S> bare<S>3205</S> him Genubath<S>1592</S> his son<S>1121</S>, whom Tahpenes<S>8472</S> weaned<S>1580</S> in<S>8432</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> house<S>1004</S>: and Genubath<S>1592</S> was in Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> household<S>1004</S> among<S>8432</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And when Hadad<S>1908</S> heard<S>8085</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S> that David<S>1732</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and that Joab<S>3097</S> the captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, Hadad<S>1908</S> said<S>559</S> to Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, Let me depart<S>7971</S>, that I may go<S>3212</S> to mine own country<S>776</S>. <sup>Let: Heb. Send me away</sup>
Then Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, But what hast thou lacked<S>2638</S> with me, that, behold, thou seekest<S>1245</S> to go<S>3212</S> to thine own country<S>776</S>? And he answered<S>559</S>, Nothing: howbeit let me go<S>7971</S> in any wise<S>7971</S>. <sup>Nothing: Heb. Not</sup>
And God<S>430</S> stirred him up<S>6965</S> another adversary<S>7854</S>, Rezon<S>7331</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Eliadah<S>450</S>, which fled<S>1272</S> from his lord<S>113</S> Hadadezer<S>1909</S> king<S>4428</S> of Zobah<S>6678</S>:
And he gathered<S>6908</S> men<S>582</S> unto him, and became captain<S>8269</S> over a band<S>1416</S>, when David<S>1732</S> slew<S>2026</S> them of Zobah: and they went<S>3212</S> to Damascus<S>1834</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> therein, and reigned<S>4427</S> in Damascus<S>1834</S>.
And he was an adversary<S>7854</S> to Israel<S>3478</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S>, beside the mischief<S>7451</S> that Hadad<S>1908</S> did: and he abhorred<S>6973</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> over Syria<S>758</S>.
And Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S>, an Ephrathite<S>673</S> of Zereda<S>6868</S>, Solomon's<S>8010</S> servant<S>5650</S>, whose mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Zeruah<S>6871</S>, a widow<S>490</S> woman<S>802</S>, even he lifted up<S>7311</S> his hand<S>3027</S> against the king<S>4428</S>.
And this was the cause<S>1697</S> that he lifted up<S>7311</S> his hand<S>3027</S> against the king<S>4428</S>: Solomon<S>8010</S> built<S>1129</S> Millo<S>4407</S>, and repaired<S>5462</S> the breaches<S>6556</S> of the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>. <sup>repaired: Heb. closed</sup>
And the man<S>376</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S> was a mighty man<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S>: and Solomon<S>8010</S> seeing<S>7200</S> the young man<S>5288</S> that he was industrious<S>6213</S> <S>4399</S>, he made him ruler<S>6485</S> over all the charge<S>5447</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>. <sup>was industrious: Heb. did work</sup> <sup>charge: Heb. burden</sup>
And it came to pass at that time<S>6256</S> when Jeroboam<S>3379</S> went out<S>3318</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, that the prophet<S>5030</S> Ahijah<S>281</S> the Shilonite<S>7888</S> found<S>4672</S> him in the way<S>1870</S>; and he had clad<S>3680</S> himself with a new<S>2319</S> garment<S>8008</S>; and they two<S>8147</S> were alone in the field<S>7704</S>:
And Ahijah<S>281</S> caught<S>8610</S> the new<S>2319</S> garment<S>8008</S> that was on him, and rent<S>7167</S> it in twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> pieces<S>7168</S>:
And he said<S>559</S> to Jeroboam<S>3379</S>, Take<S>3947</S> thee ten<S>6235</S> pieces<S>7168</S>: for thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Behold, I will rend<S>7167</S> the kingdom<S>4467</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S>, and will give<S>5414</S> ten<S>6235</S> tribes<S>7626</S> to thee:
(But he shall have one<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S> for my servant<S>5650</S> David's<S>1732</S> sake, and for Jerusalem's<S>3389</S> sake, the city<S>5892</S> which I have chosen<S>977</S> out of all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:)
Because that they have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and have worshipped<S>7812</S> Ashtoreth<S>6253</S> the goddess<S>430</S> of the Zidonians<S>6722</S>, Chemosh<S>3645</S> the god<S>430</S> of the Moabites<S>4124</S>, and Milcom<S>4445</S> the god<S>430</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and have not walked<S>1980</S> in my ways<S>1870</S>, to do<S>6213</S> that which is right<S>3477</S> in mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and to keep my statutes<S>2708</S> and my judgments<S>4941</S>, as did David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>.
Howbeit I will not take<S>3947</S> the whole kingdom<S>4467</S> out of his hand<S>3027</S>: but I will make<S>7896</S> him prince<S>5387</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S> for David<S>1732</S> my servant's<S>5650</S> sake, whom I chose<S>977</S>, because he kept<S>8104</S> my commandments<S>4687</S> and my statutes<S>2708</S>:
But I will take<S>3947</S> the kingdom<S>4410</S> out of his son's<S>1121</S> hand<S>3027</S>, and will give<S>5414</S> it unto thee, even ten<S>6235</S> tribes<S>7626</S>.
And unto his son<S>1121</S> will I give<S>5414</S> one<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S>, that David<S>1732</S> my servant<S>5650</S> may have a light<S>5216</S> alway<S>3117</S> before<S>6440</S> me in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, the city<S>5892</S> which I have chosen<S>977</S> me to put<S>7760</S> my name<S>8034</S> there. <sup>light: Heb. lamp, or, candle</sup>
And I will take<S>3947</S> thee, and thou shalt reign<S>4427</S> according to all that thy soul<S>5315</S> desireth<S>183</S>, and shalt be king<S>4428</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>.
And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken<S>8085</S> unto all that I command<S>6680</S> thee, and wilt walk<S>1980</S> in my ways<S>1870</S>, and do<S>6213</S> that is right<S>3477</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>, to keep<S>8104</S> my statutes<S>2708</S> and my commandments<S>4687</S>, as David<S>1732</S> my servant<S>5650</S> did<S>6213</S>; that I will be with thee, and build<S>1129</S> thee a sure<S>539</S> house<S>1004</S>, as I built<S>1129</S> for David<S>1732</S>, and will give<S>5414</S> Israel<S>3478</S> unto thee.
And I will for this afflict<S>6031</S> the seed<S>2233</S> of David<S>1732</S>, but not for ever<S>3117</S>.
Solomon<S>8010</S> sought<S>1245</S> therefore to kill<S>4191</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S>. And Jeroboam<S>3379</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and fled<S>1272</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>, unto Shishak<S>7895</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and was in Egypt<S>4714</S> until the death<S>4194</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S>.
And the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, and his wisdom<S>2451</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S>? <sup>acts: or, words, or, things</sup>

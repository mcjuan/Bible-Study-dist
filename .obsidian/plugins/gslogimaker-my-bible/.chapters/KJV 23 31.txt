Woe<S>1945</S> to them that go down<S>3381</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S> for help<S>5833</S>; and stay<S>8172</S> on horses<S>5483</S>, and trust<S>982</S> in chariots<S>7393</S>, because they are many<S>7227</S>; and in horsemen<S>6571</S>, because they are very<S>3966</S> strong<S>6105</S>; but they look<S>8159</S> not unto the Holy One<S>6918</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, neither seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>!
Yet he also is wise<S>2450</S>, and will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S>, and will not call back<S>5493</S> his words<S>1697</S>: but will arise<S>6965</S> against the house<S>1004</S> of the evildoers<S>7489</S>, and against the help<S>5833</S> of them that work<S>6466</S> iniquity<S>205</S>. <sup>call: Heb. remove</sup>
Now the Egyptians<S>4714</S> are men<S>120</S>, and not God<S>410</S>; and their horses<S>5483</S> flesh<S>1320</S>, and not spirit<S>7307</S>. When the LORD<S>3068</S> shall stretch out<S>5186</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, both he that helpeth<S>5826</S> shall fall<S>3782</S>, and he that is holpen<S>5826</S> shall fall down<S>5307</S>, and they all shall fail<S>3615</S> together<S>3162</S>.
For thus hath the LORD<S>3068</S> spoken<S>559</S> unto me, Like as the lion<S>738</S> and the young lion<S>3715</S> roaring<S>1897</S> on his prey<S>2964</S>, when a multitude<S>4393</S> of shepherds<S>7462</S> is called forth<S>7121</S> against him, he will not be afraid<S>2865</S> of their voice<S>6963</S>, nor abase<S>6031</S> himself for the noise<S>1995</S> of them: so shall the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> come down<S>3381</S> to fight<S>6633</S> for mount<S>2022</S> Zion<S>6726</S>, and for the hill<S>1389</S> thereof. <sup>noise: or, multitude</sup>
As birds<S>6833</S> flying<S>5774</S>, so will the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> defend<S>1598</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; defending<S>1598</S> also he will deliver<S>5337</S> it; and passing over<S>6452</S> he will preserve<S>4422</S> it.
Turn<S>7725</S> ye unto him from whom the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> have deeply<S>6009</S> revolted<S>5627</S>.
For in that day<S>3117</S> every man<S>376</S> shall cast away<S>3988</S> his idols<S>457</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and his idols<S>457</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, which your own hands<S>3027</S> have made<S>6213</S> unto you for a sin<S>2399</S>. <sup>his idols of gold: Heb. the idols of his gold</sup>
Then shall the Assyrian<S>804</S> fall<S>5307</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>, not of a mighty man<S>376</S>; and the sword<S>2719</S>, not of a mean man<S>120</S>, shall devour<S>398</S> him: but he shall flee<S>5127</S> from<S>6440</S> the sword<S>2719</S>, and his young men<S>970</S> shall be discomfited<S>4522</S>. <sup>from: or, for fear of</sup> <sup>discomfited: or, tributary: Heb. for melting, or, tribute</sup>
And he shall pass over<S>5674</S> to his strong hold<S>5553</S> for fear<S>4032</S>, and his princes<S>8269</S> shall be afraid<S>2865</S> of the ensign<S>5251</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, whose fire<S>217</S> is in Zion<S>6726</S>, and his furnace<S>8574</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>he: Heb. his rock shall pass away for fear</sup> <sup>his strong hold: or, his strength</sup>

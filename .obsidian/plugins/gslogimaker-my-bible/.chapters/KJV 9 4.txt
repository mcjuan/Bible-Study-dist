And the word<S>1697</S> of Samuel<S>8050</S> came to all Israel<S>3478</S>. Now Israel<S>3478</S> went out<S>3318</S> against<S>7125</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S> to battle<S>4421</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> beside Ebenezer<S>72</S>: and the Philistines<S>6430</S> pitched<S>2583</S> in Aphek<S>663</S>. <sup>came: or, came to pass: Hebr. was</sup>
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> put themselves in array<S>6186</S> against<S>7125</S> Israel<S>3478</S>: and when they joined<S>5203</S> battle<S>4421</S>, Israel<S>3478</S> was smitten<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>: and they slew<S>5221</S> of the army<S>4634</S> in the field<S>7704</S> about four<S>702</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>. <sup>they joined: Heb. the battle was spread</sup> <sup>army: Heb. array</sup>
And when the people<S>5971</S> were come<S>935</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>, the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S>, Wherefore hath the LORD<S>3068</S> smitten<S>5062</S> us to day<S>3117</S> before<S>6440</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>? Let us fetch<S>3947</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> out of Shiloh<S>7887</S> unto us, that, when it cometh<S>935</S> among<S>7130</S> us, it may save<S>3467</S> us out of the hand<S>3709</S> of our enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>fetch: Heb. take unto us</sup>
So the people<S>5971</S> sent<S>7971</S> to Shiloh<S>7887</S>, that they might bring<S>5375</S> from thence the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, which dwelleth<S>3427</S> between the cherubims<S>3742</S>: and the two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Eli<S>5941</S>, Hophni<S>2652</S> and Phinehas<S>6372</S>, were there with the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of God<S>430</S>.
And when the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came<S>935</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>, all Israel<S>3478</S> shouted<S>7321</S> with a great<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S>, so that the earth<S>776</S> rang again<S>1949</S>.
And when the Philistines<S>6430</S> heard<S>8085</S> the noise<S>6963</S> of the shout<S>8643</S>, they said<S>559</S>, What meaneth the noise<S>6963</S> of this great<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S> in the camp<S>4264</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S>? And they understood<S>3045</S> that the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was come<S>935</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>.
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> were afraid<S>3372</S>, for they said<S>559</S>, God<S>430</S> is come<S>935</S> into the camp<S>4264</S>. And they said<S>559</S>, Woe<S>188</S> unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore<S>865</S> <S>8032</S>. <sup>heretofore: Heb. yesterday, or, the third day</sup>
Woe<S>188</S> unto us! who shall deliver<S>5337</S> us out of the hand<S>3027</S> of these mighty<S>117</S> Gods<S>430</S>? these are the Gods<S>430</S> that smote<S>5221</S> the Egyptians<S>4714</S> with all the plagues<S>4347</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>.
Be strong<S>2388</S>, and quit<S>1961</S> yourselves like men<S>582</S>, O ye Philistines<S>6430</S>, that ye be not servants<S>5647</S> unto the Hebrews<S>5680</S>, as they have been<S>5647</S> to you: quit<S>1961</S> yourselves like men<S>582</S>, and fight<S>3898</S>. <sup>quit: Heb. be men</sup>
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> fought<S>3898</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> was smitten<S>5062</S>, and they fled<S>5127</S> every man<S>376</S> into his tent<S>168</S>: and there was a very<S>3966</S> great<S>1419</S> slaughter<S>4347</S>; for there fell<S>5307</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> thirty<S>7970</S> thousand<S>505</S> footmen<S>7273</S>.
And the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> was taken<S>3947</S>; and the two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Eli<S>5941</S>, Hophni<S>2652</S> and Phinehas<S>6372</S>, were slain<S>4191</S>. <sup>were slain: Heb. died</sup>
And there ran<S>7323</S> a man<S>376</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> out of the army<S>4634</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Shiloh<S>7887</S> the same day<S>3117</S> with his clothes<S>4055</S> rent<S>7167</S>, and with earth<S>127</S> upon his head<S>7218</S>.
And when he came<S>935</S>, lo, Eli<S>5941</S> sat<S>3427</S> upon a seat<S>3678</S> by the wayside<S>1870</S> <S>3027</S> <S>3197</S> watching<S>6822</S>: for his heart<S>3820</S> trembled<S>2730</S> for the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S>. And when the man<S>376</S> came<S>935</S> into the city<S>5892</S>, and told<S>5046</S> it, all the city<S>5892</S> cried out<S>2199</S>.
And when Eli<S>5941</S> heard<S>8085</S> the noise<S>6963</S> of the crying<S>6818</S>, he said<S>559</S>, What meaneth the noise<S>6963</S> of this tumult<S>1995</S>? And the man<S>376</S> came<S>935</S> in hastily<S>4116</S>, and told<S>5046</S> Eli<S>5941</S>.
Now Eli<S>5941</S> was ninety<S>8673</S> and eight<S>8083</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>; and his eyes<S>5869</S> were dim<S>6965</S>, that he could<S>3201</S> not see<S>7200</S>. <sup>were dim: Heb. stood</sup>
And the man<S>376</S> said<S>559</S> unto Eli<S>5941</S>, I am he that came<S>935</S> out of the army<S>4634</S>, and I fled<S>5127</S> to day<S>3117</S> out of the army<S>4634</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, What is there done<S>1697</S>, my son<S>1121</S>? <sup>is: Heb. is the thing</sup>
And the messenger<S>1319</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, Israel<S>3478</S> is fled<S>5127</S> before<S>6440</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and there hath been also a great<S>1419</S> slaughter<S>4046</S> among the people<S>5971</S>, and thy two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> also, Hophni<S>2652</S> and Phinehas<S>6372</S>, are dead<S>4191</S>, and the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> is taken<S>3947</S>.
And it came to pass, when he made mention<S>2142</S> of the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S>, that he fell<S>5307</S> from off the seat<S>3678</S> backward<S>322</S> by<S>1157</S> the side<S>3027</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>, and his neck<S>4665</S> brake<S>7665</S>, and he died<S>4191</S>: for he was an old<S>2204</S> man<S>376</S>, and heavy<S>3513</S>. And he had judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And his daughter in law<S>3618</S>, Phinehas'<S>6372</S> wife<S>802</S>, was with child<S>2030</S>, near to be delivered<S>3205</S>: and when she heard<S>8085</S> the tidings<S>8052</S> that<S>413</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> was taken<S>3947</S>, and that her father in law<S>2524</S> and her husband<S>376</S> were dead<S>4191</S>, she bowed<S>3766</S> herself and travailed<S>3205</S>; for her pains<S>6735</S> came<S>2015</S> upon her. <sup>be delivered: or, cry out</sup> <sup>came: Heb. were turned</sup>
And about the time<S>6256</S> of her death<S>4191</S> the women that stood<S>5324</S> by her said<S>1696</S> unto her, Fear<S>3372</S> not; for thou hast born<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>. But she answered<S>6030</S> not, neither did she regard<S>7896</S> <S>3820</S> it. <sup>neither: Heb. set not her heart</sup>
And she named<S>7121</S> the child<S>5288</S> Ichabod<S>350</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The glory<S>3519</S> is departed<S>1540</S> from Israel<S>3478</S>: because<S>413</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> was taken<S>3947</S>, and because of her father in law<S>2524</S> and her husband<S>376</S>. <sup>Ichabod: that is, Where is the glory? or, There is no glory</sup>
And she said<S>559</S>, The glory<S>3519</S> is departed<S>1540</S> from Israel<S>3478</S>: for the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> is taken<S>3947</S>.

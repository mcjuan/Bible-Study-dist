Keep<S>8104</S> thy foot<S>7272</S> when thou goest<S>3212</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, and be more ready<S>7138</S> to hear<S>8085</S>, than to give<S>5414</S> the sacrifice<S>2077</S> of fools<S>3684</S>: for they consider<S>3045</S> not that they do<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S>.
Be not rash<S>926</S> with thy mouth<S>6310</S>, and let not thine heart<S>3820</S> be hasty<S>4116</S> to utter<S>3318</S> any thing<S>1697</S> before<S>6440</S> God<S>430</S>: for God<S>430</S> is in heaven<S>8064</S>, and thou upon earth<S>776</S>: therefore let thy words<S>1697</S> be few<S>4592</S>. <sup>thing: or, word</sup>
For a dream<S>2472</S> cometh<S>935</S> through the multitude<S>7230</S> of business<S>6045</S>; and a fool's<S>3684</S> voice<S>6963</S> is known by multitude<S>7230</S> of words<S>1697</S>.
When thou vowest<S>5087</S> a vow<S>5088</S> unto God<S>430</S>, defer<S>309</S> not to pay<S>7999</S> it; for he hath no pleasure<S>2656</S> in fools<S>3684</S>: pay<S>7999</S> that which thou hast vowed<S>5087</S>.
Better<S>2896</S> is it that thou shouldest not vow<S>5087</S>, than that thou shouldest vow<S>5087</S> and not pay<S>7999</S>.
Suffer<S>5414</S> not thy mouth<S>6310</S> to cause thy flesh<S>1320</S> to sin<S>2398</S>; neither say<S>559</S> thou before<S>6440</S> the angel<S>4397</S>, that it was an error<S>7684</S>: wherefore should God<S>430</S> be angry<S>7107</S> at thy voice<S>6963</S>, and destroy<S>2254</S> the work<S>4639</S> of thine hands<S>3027</S>?
For in the multitude<S>7230</S> of dreams<S>2472</S> and many<S>7235</S> words<S>1697</S> there are also divers vanities<S>1892</S>: but fear<S>3372</S> thou God<S>430</S>.
If thou seest<S>7200</S> the oppression<S>6233</S> of the poor<S>7326</S>, and violent<S>1499</S> perverting of judgment<S>4941</S> and justice<S>6664</S> in a province<S>4082</S>, marvel<S>8539</S> not at the matter<S>2656</S>: for he that is higher<S>1364</S> than the highest<S>1364</S> regardeth<S>8104</S>; and there be higher<S>1364</S> than they<S>5921</S>. <sup>at the: Heb. at the will, or, purpose</sup>
Moreover the profit<S>3504</S> of the earth<S>776</S> is for all: the king<S>4428</S> himself is served<S>5647</S> by the field<S>7704</S>.
He that loveth<S>157</S> silver<S>3701</S> shall not be satisfied<S>7646</S> with silver<S>3701</S>; nor he that loveth<S>157</S> abundance<S>1995</S> with increase<S>8393</S>: this is also vanity<S>1892</S>.
When goods<S>2896</S> increase<S>7235</S>, they are increased<S>7231</S> that eat<S>398</S> them: and what good<S>3788</S> is there to the owners<S>1167</S> thereof, saving<S>518</S> the beholding<S>7207</S> <S>7212</S> of them with their eyes<S>5869</S>?
The sleep<S>8142</S> of a labouring man<S>5647</S> is sweet<S>4966</S>, whether he eat<S>398</S> little<S>4592</S> or much<S>7235</S>: but the abundance<S>7647</S> of the rich<S>6223</S> will not suffer<S>3240</S> him to sleep<S>3462</S>.
There is<S>3426</S> a sore<S>2470</S> evil<S>7451</S> which I have seen<S>7200</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>, namely, riches<S>6239</S> kept<S>8104</S> for the owners<S>1167</S> thereof to their hurt<S>7451</S>.
But those riches<S>6239</S> perish<S>6</S> by evil<S>7451</S> travail<S>6045</S>: and he begetteth<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and there is nothing<S>3972</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.
As he came forth<S>3318</S> of his mother's<S>517</S> womb<S>990</S>, naked<S>6174</S> shall he return<S>7725</S> to go<S>3212</S> as he came<S>935</S>, and shall take<S>5375</S> nothing<S>3972</S> of his labour<S>5999</S>, which he may carry away<S>3212</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.
And this<S>2090</S> also is a sore<S>2470</S> evil<S>7451</S>, that in all points<S>5980</S> as he came<S>935</S>, so shall he go<S>3212</S>: and what profit<S>3504</S> hath he that hath laboured<S>5998</S> for the wind<S>7307</S>?
All his days<S>3117</S> also he eateth<S>398</S> in darkness<S>2822</S>, and he hath much<S>7235</S> sorrow<S>3707</S> and wrath<S>7110</S> with his sickness<S>2483</S>.
Behold that which I have seen<S>7200</S>: it is good<S>2896</S> and comely<S>3303</S> for one to eat<S>398</S> and to drink<S>8354</S>, and to enjoy<S>7200</S> the good<S>2896</S> of all his labour<S>5999</S> that he taketh<S>5998</S> under the sun<S>8121</S> all<S>4557</S> the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>, which God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> him: for it is his portion<S>2506</S>. <sup>It is good: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc</sup> <sup>all the days: Heb. the number of the days</sup>
Every man<S>120</S> also to whom God<S>430</S> hath given<S>5414</S> riches<S>6239</S> and wealth<S>5233</S>, and hath given him power<S>7980</S> to eat<S>398</S> thereof, and to take<S>5375</S> his portion<S>2506</S>, and to rejoice<S>8055</S> in his labour<S>5999</S>; this<S>2090</S> is the gift<S>4991</S> of God<S>430</S>.
For he shall not much<S>7235</S> remember<S>2142</S> the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>; because God<S>430</S> answereth<S>6031</S> him in the joy<S>8057</S> of his heart<S>3820</S>. <sup>For: or, Though he give not much, yet he remembereth, etc</sup>

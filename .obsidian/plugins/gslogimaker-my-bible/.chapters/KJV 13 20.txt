And it came to pass, that after<S>6256</S> the year<S>8141</S> was expired<S>8666</S>, at the time<S>6256</S> that kings<S>4428</S> go out<S>3318</S> to battle, Joab<S>3097</S> led forth<S>5090</S> the power<S>2428</S> of the army<S>6635</S>, and wasted<S>7843</S> the country<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and came<S>935</S> and besieged<S>6696</S> Rabbah<S>7237</S>. But David<S>1732</S> tarried<S>3427</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And Joab<S>3097</S> smote<S>5221</S> Rabbah<S>7237</S>, and destroyed<S>2040</S> it. <sup>after: Heb. at the return of the year</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> took<S>3947</S> the crown<S>5850</S> of their king<S>4428</S> from off his head<S>7218</S>, and found<S>4672</S> it to weigh<S>4948</S> a talent<S>3603</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, and there were precious<S>3368</S> stones<S>68</S> in it; and it was set upon David's<S>1732</S> head<S>7218</S>: and he brought<S>3318</S> also exceeding<S>3966</S> much<S>7235</S> spoil<S>7998</S> out of the city<S>5892</S>. <sup>to weigh: Heb. the weight of</sup>
And he brought out<S>3318</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were in it, and cut<S>7787</S> them with saws<S>4050</S>, and with harrows<S>2757</S> of iron<S>1270</S>, and with axes<S>4050</S>. Even so dealt<S>6213</S> David<S>1732</S> with all the cities<S>5892</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>. And David<S>1732</S> and all the people<S>5971</S> returned<S>7725</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And it came to pass after this<S>310</S>, that there arose<S>5975</S> war<S>4421</S> at Gezer<S>1507</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>; at which time<S>227</S> Sibbechai<S>5444</S> the Hushathite<S>2843</S> slew<S>5221</S> Sippai<S>5598</S>, that was of the children<S>3211</S> of the giant<S>7497</S>: and they were subdued<S>3665</S>. <sup>arose: or, continued: Heb. stood</sup> <sup>Gezer: or, Gob</sup> <sup>the giant: or, Rapha</sup>
And there was war<S>4421</S> again with the Philistines<S>6430</S>; and Elhanan<S>445</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jair<S>3265</S> slew<S>5221</S> Lahmi<S>3902</S> the brother<S>251</S> of Goliath<S>1555</S> the Gittite<S>1663</S>, whose spear<S>2595</S> staff<S>6086</S> was like a weaver's<S>707</S> beam<S>4500</S>. <sup>Jair: called also, Iaare-ore-gim.2.Sam.21.19</sup>
And yet again there was war<S>4421</S> at Gath<S>1661</S>, where was a man<S>376</S> of great stature<S>4060</S>, whose fingers<S>676</S> and toes<S>676</S> were four<S>702</S> and twenty<S>6242</S>, six<S>8337</S> on each hand, and six<S>8337</S> on each foot: and he also was the son<S>3205</S> of the giant<S>7497</S>. <sup>great: Heb. a man of measure</sup> <sup>the son: Heb. born to the giants, or, Rapha</sup>
But when he defied<S>2778</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, Jonathan<S>3083</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shimea<S>8092</S> David's<S>1732</S> brother<S>251</S> slew<S>5221</S> him. <sup>defied: or, reproached</sup> <sup>Shimea: called Shammah</sup>
These<S>411</S> were born<S>3205</S> unto the giant<S>7497</S> in Gath<S>1661</S>; and they fell<S>5307</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and by the hand<S>3027</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>.

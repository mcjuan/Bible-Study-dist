The wicked<S>7563</S> flee<S>5127</S> when no man pursueth<S>7291</S>: but the righteous<S>6662</S> are bold<S>982</S> as a lion<S>3715</S>.
For the transgression<S>6588</S> of a land<S>776</S> many<S>7227</S> are the princes<S>8269</S> thereof: but by a man<S>120</S> of understanding<S>995</S> and knowledge<S>3045</S> the state<S>3651</S> thereof shall be prolonged<S>748</S>. <sup>by: or, by men of understanding and wisdom shall they likewise be prolonged</sup>
A poor<S>7326</S> man<S>1397</S> that oppresseth<S>6231</S> the poor<S>1800</S> is like a sweeping<S>5502</S> rain<S>4306</S> which leaveth no food<S>3899</S>. <sup>which: Heb. without food</sup>
They that forsake<S>5800</S> the law<S>8451</S> praise<S>1984</S> the wicked<S>7563</S>: but such as keep<S>8104</S> the law<S>8451</S> contend<S>1624</S> with them.
Evil<S>7451</S> men<S>582</S> understand<S>995</S> not judgment<S>4941</S>: but they that seek<S>1245</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> understand<S>995</S> all things.
Better<S>2896</S> is the poor<S>7326</S> that walketh<S>1980</S> in his uprightness<S>8537</S>, than he that is perverse<S>6141</S> in his ways<S>1870</S>, though he be rich<S>6223</S>.
Whoso keepeth<S>5341</S> the law<S>8451</S> is a wise<S>995</S> son<S>1121</S>: but he that is a companion<S>7462</S> of riotous<S>2151</S> men shameth<S>3637</S> his father<S>1</S>. <sup>is a companion: or, feedeth gluttons</sup>
He that by usury<S>5392</S> and unjust gain<S>8636</S> increaseth<S>7235</S> his substance<S>1952</S>, he shall gather<S>6908</S> it for him that will pity<S>2603</S> the poor<S>1800</S>. <sup>unjust: Heb. by increase</sup>
He that turneth away<S>5493</S> his ear<S>241</S> from hearing<S>8085</S> the law<S>8451</S>, even his prayer<S>8605</S> shall be abomination<S>8441</S>.
Whoso causeth the righteous<S>3477</S> to go astray<S>7686</S> in an evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>, he shall fall<S>5307</S> himself into his own pit<S>7816</S>: but the upright<S>8549</S> shall have good<S>2896</S> things in possession<S>5157</S>.
The rich<S>6223</S> man<S>376</S> is wise<S>2450</S> in his own conceit<S>5869</S>; but the poor<S>1800</S> that hath understanding<S>995</S> searcheth him out<S>2713</S>. <sup>own: Heb. eyes</sup>
When righteous<S>6662</S> men do rejoice<S>5970</S>, there is great<S>7227</S> glory<S>8597</S>: but when the wicked<S>7563</S> rise<S>6965</S>, a man<S>120</S> is hidden<S>2664</S>. <sup>hidden: or, sought for</sup>
He that covereth<S>3680</S> his sins<S>6588</S> shall not prosper<S>6743</S>: but whoso confesseth<S>3034</S> and forsaketh<S>5800</S> them shall have mercy<S>7355</S>.
Happy<S>835</S> is the man<S>120</S> that feareth<S>6342</S> alway<S>8548</S>: but he that hardeneth<S>7185</S> his heart<S>3820</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> into mischief<S>7451</S>.
As a roaring<S>5098</S> lion<S>738</S>, and a ranging<S>8264</S> bear<S>1677</S>; so is a wicked<S>7563</S> ruler<S>4910</S> over the poor<S>1800</S> people<S>5971</S>.
The prince<S>5057</S> that wanteth<S>2638</S> understanding<S>8394</S> is also a great<S>7227</S> oppressor<S>4642</S>: but he that hateth<S>8130</S> covetousness<S>1215</S> shall prolong<S>748</S> his days<S>3117</S>.
A man<S>120</S> that doeth violence<S>6231</S> to the blood<S>1818</S> of any person<S>5315</S> shall flee<S>5127</S> to the pit<S>953</S>; let no man stay<S>8551</S> him.
Whoso walketh<S>1980</S> uprightly<S>8549</S> shall be saved<S>3467</S>: but he that is perverse<S>6140</S> in his ways<S>1870</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> at once<S>259</S>.
He that tilleth<S>5647</S> his land<S>127</S> shall have plenty<S>7646</S> of bread<S>3899</S>: but he that followeth<S>7291</S> after vain<S>7386</S> persons shall have poverty enough<S>7389</S>.
A faithful<S>530</S> man<S>376</S> shall abound<S>7227</S> with blessings<S>1293</S>: but he that maketh haste<S>213</S> to be rich<S>6238</S> shall not be innocent<S>5352</S>. <sup>innocent: or, unpunished</sup>
To have respect<S>5234</S> of persons<S>6440</S> is not good<S>2896</S>: for for a piece<S>6595</S> of bread<S>3899</S> that man<S>1397</S> will transgress<S>6586</S>.
He<S>376</S> that hasteth<S>926</S> to be rich<S>1952</S> hath an evil<S>7451</S> eye<S>5869</S>, and considereth<S>3045</S> not that poverty<S>2639</S> shall come<S>935</S> upon him. <sup>hasteth: or, hath and evil eye hasteth to be rich</sup>
He that rebuketh<S>3198</S> a man<S>120</S> afterwards<S>310</S> shall find<S>4672</S> more favour<S>2580</S> than he that flattereth<S>2505</S> with the tongue<S>3956</S>.
Whoso robbeth<S>1497</S> his father<S>1</S> or his mother<S>517</S>, and saith<S>559</S>, It is no transgression<S>6588</S>; the same is the companion<S>2270</S> of a destroyer<S>376</S> <S>7843</S>. <sup>a destroyer: Heb. a man destroying</sup>
He that is of a proud<S>7342</S> heart<S>5315</S> stirreth up<S>1624</S> strife<S>4066</S>: but he that putteth his trust<S>982</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> shall be made fat<S>1878</S>.
He that trusteth<S>982</S> in his own heart<S>3820</S> is a fool<S>3684</S>: but whoso walketh<S>1980</S> wisely<S>2451</S>, he shall be delivered<S>4422</S>.
He that giveth<S>5414</S> unto the poor<S>7326</S> shall not lack<S>4270</S>: but he that hideth<S>5956</S> his eyes<S>5869</S> shall have many<S>7227</S> a curse<S>3994</S>.
When the wicked<S>7563</S> rise<S>6965</S>, men<S>120</S> hide<S>5641</S> themselves: but when they perish<S>6</S>, the righteous<S>6662</S> increase<S>7235</S>.

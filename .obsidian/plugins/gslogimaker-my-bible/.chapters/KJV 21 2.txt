I said<S>559</S> in mine heart<S>3820</S>, Go to now<S>3212</S>, I will prove<S>5254</S> thee with mirth<S>8057</S>, therefore enjoy<S>7200</S> pleasure<S>2896</S>: and, behold, this also is vanity<S>1892</S>.
I said<S>559</S> of laughter<S>7814</S>, It is mad<S>1984</S>: and of mirth<S>8057</S>, What<S>2090</S> doeth<S>6213</S> it?
I sought<S>8446</S> in mine heart<S>3820</S> to give<S>4900</S> myself<S>1320</S> unto wine<S>3196</S>, yet acquainting<S>5090</S> mine heart<S>3820</S> with wisdom<S>2451</S>; and to lay hold<S>270</S> on folly<S>5531</S>, till I might see<S>7200</S> what was that good<S>2896</S> for the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, which they should do<S>6213</S> under the heaven<S>8064</S> all<S>4557</S> the days<S>3117</S> of their life<S>2416</S>. <sup>to give: Heb. to draw my flesh with wine</sup> <sup>all: Heb. the number of the days of their life</sup>
I made me great<S>1431</S> works<S>4639</S>; I builded<S>1129</S> me houses<S>1004</S>; I planted<S>5193</S> me vineyards<S>3754</S>:
I made<S>6213</S> me gardens<S>1593</S> and orchards<S>6508</S>, and I planted<S>5193</S> trees<S>6086</S> in them of all kind of fruits<S>6529</S>:
I made<S>6213</S> me pools<S>1295</S> of water<S>4325</S>, to water<S>8248</S> therewith the wood<S>3293</S> that bringeth forth<S>6779</S> trees<S>6086</S>:
I got<S>7069</S> me servants<S>5650</S> and maidens<S>8198</S>, and had servants born<S>1121</S> in my house<S>1004</S>; also I had great<S>7235</S> possessions<S>4735</S> of great<S>1241</S> and small cattle<S>6629</S> above all that were in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> before<S>6440</S> me: <sup>servants born: Heb. sons of my house</sup>
I gathered<S>3664</S> me also silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>, and the peculiar treasure<S>5459</S> of kings<S>4428</S> and of the provinces<S>4082</S>: I gat<S>6213</S> me men singers<S>7891</S> and women singers<S>7891</S>, and the delights<S>8588</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, as musical instruments<S>7705</S> <S>7705</S>, and that of all sorts. <sup>musical: Heb. musical instrument and instruments</sup>
So I was great<S>1431</S>, and increased<S>3254</S> more than all that were before<S>6440</S> me in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: also my wisdom<S>2451</S> remained<S>5975</S> with me.
And whatsoever mine eyes<S>5869</S> desired<S>7592</S> I kept<S>680</S> not from them, I withheld<S>4513</S> not my heart<S>3820</S> from any joy<S>8057</S>; for my heart<S>3820</S> rejoiced<S>8056</S> in all my labour<S>5999</S>: and this was my portion<S>2506</S> of all my labour<S>5999</S>.
Then I looked<S>6437</S> on all the works<S>4639</S> that my hands<S>3027</S> had wrought<S>6213</S>, and on the labour<S>5999</S> that I had laboured<S>5998</S> to do<S>6213</S>: and, behold, all was vanity<S>1892</S> and vexation<S>7469</S> of spirit<S>7307</S>, and there was no profit<S>3504</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>.
And I turned<S>6437</S> myself to behold<S>7200</S> wisdom<S>2451</S>, and madness<S>1947</S>, and folly<S>5531</S>: for what can the man<S>120</S> do that cometh<S>935</S> after<S>310</S> the king<S>4428</S>? even that which hath been already<S>3528</S> done<S>6213</S>. <sup>even: or, in those things which have been already done</sup>
Then I saw<S>7200</S> that<S>3426</S> wisdom<S>2451</S> excelleth<S>3504</S> folly<S>5531</S>, as far as light<S>216</S> excelleth<S>3504</S> darkness<S>2822</S>. <sup>that: Heb. that there is an excellency in wisdom more than in folly, etc</sup>
The wise man's<S>2450</S> eyes<S>5869</S> are in his head<S>7218</S>; but the fool<S>3684</S> walketh<S>1980</S> in darkness<S>2822</S>: and I myself perceived<S>3045</S> also that one<S>259</S> event<S>4745</S> happeneth<S>7136</S> to them all.
Then<S>227</S> said<S>559</S> I in my heart<S>3820</S>, As it happeneth<S>4745</S> to the fool<S>3684</S>, so it happeneth<S>7136</S> even to me<S>1571</S>; and why was I then more<S>3148</S> wise<S>2449</S>? Then I said<S>1696</S> in my heart<S>3820</S>, that this also is vanity<S>1892</S>. <sup>happeneth even: Heb. happeneth to me, even to me</sup>
For there is no remembrance<S>2146</S> of the wise<S>2450</S> more than<S>5973</S> of the fool<S>3684</S> for ever<S>5769</S>; seeing that which now<S>3528</S> is in the days<S>3117</S> to come<S>935</S> shall all be forgotten<S>7911</S>. And how dieth<S>4191</S> the wise<S>2450</S> man? as the fool<S>3684</S>.
Therefore I hated<S>8130</S> life<S>2416</S>; because the work<S>4639</S> that is wrought<S>6213</S> under the sun<S>8121</S> is grievous<S>7451</S> unto me: for all is vanity<S>1892</S> and vexation<S>7469</S> of spirit<S>7307</S>.
Yea, I hated<S>8130</S> all my labour<S>5999</S> which I had taken<S>6001</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>: because I should leave<S>3240</S> it unto the man<S>120</S> that shall be after<S>310</S> me. <sup>taken: Heb. laboured</sup>
And who knoweth<S>3045</S> whether he shall be a wise<S>2450</S> man or a fool<S>5530</S>? yet shall he have rule<S>7980</S> over all my labour<S>5999</S> wherein I have laboured<S>5998</S>, and wherein I have shewed myself wise<S>2449</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>. This is also vanity<S>1892</S>.
Therefore I went about<S>5437</S> to cause<S>2976</S> my heart<S>3820</S> to despair<S>2976</S> of all the labour<S>5999</S> which I took<S>5998</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>.
For there is<S>3426</S> a man<S>120</S> whose labour<S>5999</S> is in wisdom<S>2451</S>, and in knowledge<S>1847</S>, and in equity<S>3788</S>; yet to a man<S>120</S> that hath not laboured<S>5998</S> therein shall he leave<S>5414</S> it for his portion<S>2506</S>. This also is vanity<S>1892</S> and a great<S>7227</S> evil<S>7451</S>. <sup>leave: Heb. give</sup>
For what hath<S>1933</S> man<S>120</S> of all his labour<S>5999</S>, and of the vexation<S>7475</S> of his heart<S>3820</S>, wherein<S>1931</S> he hath laboured<S>6001</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>?
For all his days<S>3117</S> are sorrows<S>4341</S>, and his travail<S>6045</S> grief<S>3708</S>; yea, his heart<S>3820</S> taketh not rest<S>7901</S> in the night<S>3915</S>. This is also vanity<S>1892</S>.
There is nothing better<S>2896</S> for a man<S>120</S>, than that he should eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>, and that he should make his soul<S>5315</S> enjoy<S>7200</S> good<S>2896</S> in his labour<S>5999</S>. This<S>2090</S> also I saw<S>7200</S>, that it was from the hand<S>3027</S> of God<S>430</S>. <sup>should make: or, delight his senses</sup>
For who can eat<S>398</S>, or who else can hasten<S>2363</S> hereunto, more<S>2351</S> than I?
For God giveth<S>5414</S> to a man<S>120</S> that is good<S>2896</S> in his sight<S>6440</S> wisdom<S>2451</S>, and knowledge<S>1847</S>, and joy<S>8057</S>: but to the sinner<S>2398</S> he giveth<S>5414</S> travail<S>6045</S>, to gather<S>622</S> and to heap up<S>3664</S>, that he may give<S>5414</S> to him that is good<S>2896</S> before<S>6440</S> God<S>430</S>. This also is vanity<S>1892</S> and vexation<S>7469</S> of spirit<S>7307</S>. <sup>in his: Heb. before him</sup>

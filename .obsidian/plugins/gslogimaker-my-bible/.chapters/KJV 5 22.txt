Thou shalt not see<S>7200</S> thy brother's<S>251</S> ox<S>7794</S> or his sheep<S>7716</S> go astray<S>5080</S>, and hide<S>5956</S> thyself from them: thou shalt in any case<S>7725</S> bring them again<S>7725</S> unto thy brother<S>251</S>.
And if thy brother<S>251</S> be not nigh<S>7138</S> unto thee, or if thou know<S>3045</S> him not, then thou shalt bring<S>622</S> it unto<S>8432</S> thine own house<S>1004</S>, and it shall be with thee until thy brother<S>251</S> seek<S>1875</S> after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again<S>7725</S>.
In like manner<S>3651</S> shalt thou do<S>6213</S> with his ass<S>2543</S>; and so shalt thou do<S>6213</S> with his raiment<S>8071</S>; and with all lost thing<S>9</S> of thy brother's<S>251</S>, which he hath lost<S>6</S>, and thou hast found<S>4672</S>, shalt thou do<S>6213</S> likewise: thou mayest<S>3201</S> not hide<S>5956</S> thyself.
Thou shalt not see<S>7200</S> thy brother's<S>251</S> ass<S>2543</S> or his ox<S>7794</S> fall down<S>5307</S> by the way<S>1870</S>, and hide<S>5956</S> thyself from them: thou shalt surely<S>6965</S> help him to lift them up again<S>6965</S>.
The woman<S>802</S> shall not wear that which pertaineth<S>3627</S> unto a man<S>1397</S>, neither shall a man<S>1397</S> put<S>3847</S> on a woman's<S>802</S> garment<S>8071</S>: for all that do<S>6213</S> so<S>428</S> are abomination<S>8441</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>.
If a bird's<S>6833</S> nest<S>7064</S> chance<S>7122</S> to be before<S>6440</S> thee in the way<S>1870</S> in any tree<S>6086</S>, or on the ground<S>776</S>, whether they be young ones<S>667</S>, or eggs<S>1000</S>, and the dam<S>517</S> sitting<S>7257</S> upon the young<S>667</S>, or upon the eggs<S>1000</S>, thou shalt not take<S>3947</S> the dam<S>517</S> with the young<S>1121</S>:
But thou shalt in any wise<S>7971</S> let the dam<S>517</S> go<S>7971</S>, and take<S>3947</S> the young<S>1121</S> to thee; that it may be well<S>3190</S> with thee, and that thou mayest prolong<S>748</S> thy days<S>3117</S>.
When thou buildest<S>1129</S> a new<S>2319</S> house<S>1004</S>, then thou shalt make<S>6213</S> a battlement<S>4624</S> for thy roof<S>1406</S>, that thou bring<S>7760</S> not blood<S>1818</S> upon thine house<S>1004</S>, if any man<S>5307</S> fall<S>5307</S> from thence.
Thou shalt not sow<S>2232</S> thy vineyard<S>3754</S> with divers seeds<S>3610</S>: lest the fruit<S>4395</S> of thy seed<S>2233</S> which thou hast sown<S>2232</S>, and the fruit<S>8393</S> of thy vineyard<S>3754</S>, be defiled<S>6942</S>. <sup>fruit of thy seed: Heb. fulness of the seed</sup>
Thou shalt not plow<S>2790</S> with an ox<S>7794</S> and an ass<S>2543</S> together<S>3162</S>.
Thou shalt not wear<S>3847</S> a garment of divers sorts<S>8162</S>, as of woollen<S>6785</S> and linen<S>6593</S> together<S>3162</S>.
Thou shalt make<S>6213</S> thee fringes<S>1434</S> upon the four<S>702</S> quarters<S>3671</S> of thy vesture<S>3682</S>, wherewith thou coverest<S>3680</S> thyself. <sup>quarters: Heb. wings</sup>
If any man<S>376</S> take<S>3947</S> a wife<S>802</S>, and go in<S>935</S> unto her, and hate<S>8130</S> her,
And give<S>7760</S> occasions<S>5949</S> of speech<S>1697</S> against her, and bring up<S>3318</S> an evil<S>7451</S> name<S>8034</S> upon her, and say<S>559</S>, I took<S>3947</S> this woman<S>802</S>, and when I came<S>7126</S> to her, I found<S>4672</S> her not a maid<S>1331</S>:
Then shall the father<S>1</S> of the damsel<S>5291</S>, and her mother<S>517</S>, take<S>3947</S> and bring forth<S>3318</S> the tokens of the damsel's<S>5291</S> virginity<S>1331</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S> of the city<S>5892</S> in the gate<S>8179</S>:
And the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S> shall say<S>559</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S>, I gave<S>5414</S> my daughter<S>1323</S> unto this man<S>376</S> to wife<S>802</S>, and he hateth<S>8130</S> her;
And, lo, he hath given<S>7760</S> occasions<S>5949</S> of speech<S>1697</S> against her, saying<S>559</S>, I found<S>4672</S> not thy daughter<S>1323</S> a maid<S>1331</S>; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's<S>1323</S> virginity<S>1331</S>. And they shall spread<S>6566</S> the cloth<S>8071</S> before<S>6440</S> the elders<S>2205</S> of the city<S>5892</S>.
And the elders<S>2205</S> of that city<S>5892</S> shall take<S>3947</S> that man<S>376</S> and chastise<S>3256</S> him;
And they shall amerce<S>6064</S> him in an hundred<S>3967</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S>, and give<S>5414</S> them unto the father<S>1</S> of the damsel<S>5291</S>, because he hath brought up<S>3318</S> an evil<S>7451</S> name<S>8034</S> upon a virgin<S>1330</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and she shall be his wife<S>802</S>; he may<S>3201</S> not put her away<S>7971</S> all his days<S>3117</S>.
But if this thing<S>1697</S> be true<S>571</S>, and the tokens of virginity<S>1331</S> be not found<S>4672</S> for the damsel<S>5291</S>:
Then they shall bring out<S>3318</S> the damsel<S>5291</S> to the door<S>6607</S> of her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>, and the men<S>582</S> of her city<S>5892</S> shall stone<S>5619</S> her with stones<S>68</S> that she die<S>4191</S>: because she hath wrought<S>6213</S> folly<S>5039</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, to play the whore<S>2181</S> in her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>: so shalt thou put<S>1197</S> evil<S>7451</S> away<S>1197</S> from among<S>7130</S> you.
If a man<S>376</S> be found<S>4672</S> lying<S>7901</S> with a woman<S>802</S> married<S>1166</S> to an husband<S>1167</S>, then they shall both of them<S>8147</S> die<S>4191</S>, both the man<S>376</S> that lay<S>7901</S> with the woman<S>802</S>, and the woman<S>802</S>: so shalt thou put away<S>1197</S> evil<S>7451</S> from Israel<S>3478</S>.
If a damsel<S>5291</S> that is a virgin<S>1330</S> be betrothed<S>781</S> unto an husband<S>376</S>, and a man<S>376</S> find<S>4672</S> her in the city<S>5892</S>, and lie<S>7901</S> with her;
Then ye shall bring<S>3318</S> them both<S>8147</S> out unto the gate<S>8179</S> of that city<S>5892</S>, and ye shall stone<S>5619</S> them with stones<S>68</S> that they die<S>4191</S>; the damsel<S>5291</S>, because<S>834</S> <S>1697</S> she cried<S>6817</S> not, being in the city<S>5892</S>; and the man<S>376</S>, because<S>834</S> <S>1697</S> he hath humbled<S>6031</S> his neighbour's<S>7453</S> wife<S>802</S>: so thou shalt put away<S>1197</S> evil<S>7451</S> from among<S>7130</S> you.
But if a man<S>376</S> find<S>4672</S> a betrothed<S>781</S> damsel<S>5291</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, and the man<S>376</S> force<S>2388</S> her, and lie<S>7901</S> with her: then the man<S>376</S> only that lay<S>7901</S> with her shall die<S>4191</S>: <sup>force: or, take strong hold of</sup>
But unto the damsel<S>5291</S> thou shalt do<S>6213</S> nothing<S>1697</S>; there is in the damsel<S>5291</S> no sin<S>2399</S> worthy of death<S>4194</S>: for as when a man<S>376</S> riseth<S>6965</S> against his neighbour<S>7453</S>, and slayeth<S>7523</S> <S>5315</S> him, even so is this matter<S>1697</S>:
For he found<S>4672</S> her in the field<S>7704</S>, and the betrothed<S>781</S> damsel<S>5291</S> cried<S>6817</S>, and there was none to save<S>3467</S> her.
If a man<S>376</S> find<S>4672</S> a damsel<S>5291</S> that is a virgin<S>1330</S>, which is not betrothed<S>781</S>, and lay hold<S>8610</S> on her, and lie<S>7901</S> with her, and they be found<S>4672</S>;
Then the man<S>376</S> that lay<S>7901</S> with her shall give<S>5414</S> unto the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S> fifty<S>2572</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S>, and she shall be his wife<S>802</S>; because he hath humbled<S>6031</S> her, he may<S>3201</S> not put her away<S>7971</S> all his days<S>3117</S>.

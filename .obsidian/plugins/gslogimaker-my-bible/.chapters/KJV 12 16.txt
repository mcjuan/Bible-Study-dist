In the seventeenth<S>7651</S> <S>6240</S> <S>8141</S> year<S>8141</S> of Pekah<S>6492</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Remaliah<S>7425</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jotham<S>3147</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> began to reign<S>4427</S>.
Twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> was Ahaz<S>271</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and did<S>6213</S> not that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, like David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>.
But he walked<S>3212</S> in the way<S>1870</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, yea, and made his son<S>1121</S> to pass through<S>5674</S> the fire<S>784</S>, according to the abominations<S>8441</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>, whom the LORD<S>3068</S> cast out<S>3423</S> from before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he sacrificed<S>2076</S> and burnt incense<S>6999</S> in the high places<S>1116</S>, and on the hills<S>1389</S>, and under every green<S>7488</S> tree<S>6086</S>.
Then Rezin<S>7526</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> and Pekah<S>6492</S> son<S>1121</S> of Remaliah<S>7425</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came up<S>5927</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S> to war<S>4421</S>: and they besieged<S>6696</S> Ahaz<S>271</S>, but could<S>3201</S> not overcome<S>3898</S> him.
At that time<S>6256</S> Rezin<S>7526</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> recovered<S>7725</S> Elath<S>359</S> to Syria<S>758</S> <S>130</S>, and drave<S>5394</S> the Jews<S>3064</S> from Elath<S>359</S>: and the Syrians<S>726</S> came<S>935</S> to Elath<S>359</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> there unto this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>from Elath: Heb. from Eloth</sup>
So Ahaz<S>271</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to Tiglathpileser<S>8407</S> king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I am thy servant<S>5650</S> and thy son<S>1121</S>: come up<S>5927</S>, and save<S>3467</S> me out of the hand<S>3709</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, and out of the hand<S>3709</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which rise up<S>6965</S> against me.
And Ahaz<S>271</S> took<S>3947</S> the silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S> that was found<S>4672</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and in the treasures<S>214</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> it for a present<S>7810</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto him: for the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> went up<S>5927</S> against Damascus<S>1834</S>, and took<S>8610</S> it, and carried the people of it captive<S>1540</S> to Kir<S>7024</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> Rezin<S>7526</S>. <sup>Damascus: Heb. Dammesek</sup>
And king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> went<S>3212</S> to Damascus<S>1834</S> to meet<S>7125</S> Tiglathpileser<S>8407</S> king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> an altar<S>4196</S> that was at Damascus<S>1834</S>: and king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> sent<S>7971</S> to Urijah<S>223</S> the priest<S>3548</S> the fashion<S>1823</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>, and the pattern<S>8403</S> of it, according to all the workmanship<S>4639</S> thereof. <sup>Damascus: Heb. Dammesek</sup>
And Urijah<S>223</S> the priest<S>3548</S> built<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S> according to all that king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> had sent<S>7971</S> from Damascus<S>1834</S>: so Urijah<S>223</S> the priest<S>3548</S> made<S>6213</S> it against king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> came<S>935</S> from Damascus<S>1834</S>.
And when the king<S>4428</S> was come<S>935</S> from Damascus<S>1834</S>, the king<S>4428</S> saw<S>7200</S> the altar<S>4196</S>: and the king<S>4428</S> approached<S>7126</S> to the altar<S>4196</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> thereon.
And he burnt<S>6999</S> his burnt offering<S>5930</S> and his meat offering<S>4503</S>, and poured<S>5258</S> his drink offering<S>5262</S>, and sprinkled<S>2236</S> the blood<S>1818</S> of his peace offerings<S>8002</S>, upon the altar<S>4196</S>. <sup>his peace offerings: Heb. the peace offerings which were his</sup>
And he brought<S>7126</S> also the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S>, which was before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, from the forefront<S>6440</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, from between the altar<S>4196</S> and the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and put<S>5414</S> it on the north<S>6828</S> side<S>3409</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>.
And king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Urijah<S>223</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Upon the great<S>1419</S> altar<S>4196</S> burn<S>6999</S> the morning<S>1242</S> burnt offering<S>5930</S>, and the evening<S>6153</S> meat offering<S>4503</S>, and the king's<S>4428</S> burnt sacrifice<S>5930</S>, and his meat offering<S>4503</S>, with the burnt offering<S>5930</S> of all the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, and their meat offering<S>4503</S>, and their drink offerings<S>5262</S>; and sprinkle<S>2236</S> upon it all the blood<S>1818</S> of the burnt offering<S>5930</S>, and all the blood<S>1818</S> of the sacrifice<S>2077</S>: and the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S> shall be for me to enquire<S>1239</S> by.
Thus did<S>6213</S> Urijah<S>223</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, according to all that king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> commanded<S>6680</S>.
And king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> cut off<S>7112</S> the borders<S>4526</S> of the bases<S>4350</S>, and removed<S>5493</S> the laver<S>3595</S> from off them; and took down<S>3381</S> the sea<S>3220</S> from off the brasen<S>5178</S> oxen<S>1241</S> that were under it, and put<S>5414</S> it upon a pavement<S>4837</S> of stones<S>68</S>.
And the covert<S>4329</S> <S>4329</S> for the sabbath<S>7676</S> that they had built<S>1129</S> in the house<S>1004</S>, and the king's<S>4428</S> entry<S>3996</S> without<S>2435</S>, turned<S>5437</S> he from the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> for<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Ahaz<S>271</S> which he did<S>6213</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>?
And Ahaz<S>271</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> with his fathers<S>1</S> in the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>: and Hezekiah<S>2396</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.

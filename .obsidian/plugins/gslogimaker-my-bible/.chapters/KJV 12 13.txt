In the three<S>7969</S> <S>8141</S> and twentieth<S>6242</S> year<S>8141</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehu<S>3058</S> began to reign<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S>, and reigned seventeen<S>7651</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>three: Heb. twentieth year and third year</sup>
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and followed<S>3212</S> <S>310</S> the sins<S>2403</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S>, which made Israel<S>3478</S> to sin<S>2398</S>; he departed<S>5493</S> not therefrom. <sup>followed: Heb. walked after</sup>
And the anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was kindled<S>2734</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>, and he delivered<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of Hazael<S>2371</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of Benhadad<S>1130</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hazael<S>2371</S>, all their days<S>3117</S>.
And Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> besought<S>2470</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto<S>6440</S> him: for he saw<S>7200</S> the oppression<S>3906</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, because the king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> oppressed<S>3905</S> them.
(And the LORD<S>3068</S> gave<S>5414</S> Israel<S>3478</S> a saviour<S>3467</S>, so that they went out<S>3318</S> from under the hand<S>3027</S> of the Syrians<S>758</S>: and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> in their tents<S>168</S>, as beforetime<S>8032</S> <S>8543</S>. <sup>as beforetime: Heb. as yesterday, and third day</sup>
Nevertheless they departed<S>5493</S> not from the sins<S>2403</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S>, who made Israel<S>3478</S> sin<S>2398</S>, but walked<S>1980</S> therein: and there remained<S>5975</S> the grove<S>842</S> also in Samaria<S>8111</S>.) <sup>walked: Heb. he walked</sup> <sup>remained: Heb. stood</sup>
Neither did he leave<S>7604</S> of the people<S>5971</S> to Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> but fifty<S>2572</S> horsemen<S>6571</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> chariots<S>7393</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> footmen<S>7273</S>; for the king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> had destroyed<S>6</S> them, and had made<S>7760</S> them like the dust<S>6083</S> by threshing<S>1758</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, and his might<S>1369</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?
And Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>; and they buried<S>6912</S> him in Samaria<S>8111</S>: and Joash<S>3101</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
In the thirty<S>7970</S> <S>8141</S> and seventh<S>7651</S> year<S>8141</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> began Jehoash<S>3060</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> to reign<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S>, and reigned sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; he departed<S>5493</S> not from all the sins<S>2403</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S>, who made Israel<S>3478</S> sin<S>2398</S>: but he walked<S>1980</S> therein.
And the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Joash<S>3101</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, and his might<S>1369</S> wherewith he fought<S>3898</S> against Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?
And Joash<S>3101</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>; and Jeroboam<S>3379</S> sat<S>3427</S> upon his throne<S>3678</S>: and Joash<S>3101</S> was buried<S>6912</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S> with the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
Now Elisha<S>477</S> was fallen sick<S>2470</S> of his sickness<S>2483</S> whereof he died<S>4191</S>. And Joash<S>3101</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came down<S>3381</S> unto him, and wept<S>1058</S> over his face<S>6440</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O my father<S>1</S>, my father<S>1</S>, the chariot<S>7393</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and the horsemen<S>6571</S> thereof.
And Elisha<S>477</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Take<S>3947</S> bow<S>7198</S> and arrows<S>2671</S>. And he took<S>3947</S> unto him bow<S>7198</S> and arrows<S>2671</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Put<S>7392</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> upon the bow<S>7198</S>. And he put<S>7392</S> his hand<S>3027</S> upon it: and Elisha<S>477</S> put<S>7760</S> his hands<S>3027</S> upon the king's<S>4428</S> hands<S>3027</S>. <sup>Put thine: Heb. Make thine hand to ride</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, Open<S>6605</S> the window<S>2474</S> eastward<S>6924</S>. And he opened<S>6605</S> it. Then Elisha<S>477</S> said<S>559</S>, Shoot<S>3384</S>. And he shot<S>3384</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, The arrow<S>2671</S> of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> deliverance<S>8668</S>, and the arrow<S>2671</S> of deliverance<S>8668</S> from Syria<S>758</S>: for thou shalt smite<S>5221</S> the Syrians<S>758</S> in Aphek<S>663</S>, till thou have consumed<S>3615</S> them.
And he said<S>559</S>, Take<S>3947</S> the arrows<S>2671</S>. And he took<S>3947</S> them. And he said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Smite<S>5221</S> upon the ground<S>776</S>. And he smote<S>5221</S> thrice<S>7969</S> <S>6471</S>, and stayed<S>5975</S>.
And the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> was wroth<S>7107</S> with him, and said<S>559</S>, Thou shouldest have smitten<S>5221</S> five<S>2568</S> or six<S>8337</S> times<S>6471</S>; then hadst thou smitten<S>5221</S> Syria<S>758</S> till thou hadst consumed<S>3615</S> it: whereas now thou shalt smite<S>5221</S> Syria<S>758</S> but thrice<S>7969</S> <S>6471</S>.
And Elisha<S>477</S> died<S>4191</S>, and they buried<S>6912</S> him. And the bands<S>1416</S> of the Moabites<S>4124</S> invaded<S>935</S> the land<S>776</S> at the coming in<S>935</S> of the year<S>8141</S>.
And it came to pass, as they were burying<S>6912</S> a man<S>376</S>, that, behold, they spied<S>7200</S> a band<S>1416</S> of men; and they cast<S>7993</S> the man<S>376</S> into the sepulchre<S>6913</S> of Elisha<S>477</S>: and when the man<S>376</S> was let down<S>3212</S>, and touched<S>5060</S> the bones<S>6106</S> of Elisha<S>477</S>, he revived<S>2421</S>, and stood up<S>6965</S> on his feet<S>7272</S>. <sup>was: Heb. went down</sup>
But Hazael<S>2371</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> oppressed<S>3905</S> Israel<S>3478</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was gracious<S>2603</S> unto them, and had compassion<S>7355</S> on them, and had respect<S>6437</S> unto them, because of<S>4616</S> his covenant<S>1285</S> with Abraham<S>85</S>, Isaac<S>3327</S>, and Jacob<S>3290</S>, and would<S>14</S> not destroy<S>7843</S> them, neither cast<S>7993</S> he them from his presence<S>6440</S> as yet<S>5704</S>. <sup>presence: Heb. face</sup>
So Hazael<S>2371</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> died<S>4191</S>; and Benhadad<S>1130</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
And Jehoash<S>3060</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> took<S>3947</S> again<S>7725</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of Benhadad<S>1130</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hazael<S>2371</S> the cities<S>5892</S>, which he had taken<S>3947</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> his father<S>1</S> by war<S>4421</S>. Three<S>7969</S> times<S>6471</S> did Joash<S>3101</S> beat<S>5221</S> him, and recovered<S>7725</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>took: Heb. returned and took</sup>

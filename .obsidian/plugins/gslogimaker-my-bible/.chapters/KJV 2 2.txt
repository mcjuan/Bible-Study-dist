And there went<S>3212</S> a man<S>376</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>, and took<S>3947</S> to wife a daughter<S>1323</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>.
And the woman<S>802</S> conceived<S>2029</S>, and bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>: and when she saw<S>7200</S> him that he was a goodly<S>2896</S> child, she hid<S>6845</S> him three<S>7969</S> months<S>3391</S>.
And when she could<S>3201</S> not longer<S>5750</S> hide<S>6845</S> him, she took<S>3947</S> for him an ark<S>8392</S> of bulrushes<S>1573</S>, and daubed<S>2560</S> it with slime<S>2564</S> and with pitch<S>2203</S>, and put<S>7760</S> the child<S>3206</S> therein; and she laid<S>7760</S> it in the flags<S>5488</S> by the river's<S>2975</S> brink<S>8193</S>.
And his sister<S>269</S> stood<S>3320</S> afar off<S>7350</S>, to wit<S>3045</S> what would be done<S>6213</S> to him.
And the daughter<S>1323</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> came down<S>3381</S> to wash<S>7364</S> herself at the river<S>2975</S>; and her maidens<S>5291</S> walked<S>1980</S> along by the river's<S>2975</S> side<S>3027</S>; and when she saw<S>7200</S> the ark<S>8392</S> among<S>8432</S> the flags<S>5488</S>, she sent<S>7971</S> her maid<S>519</S> to fetch<S>3947</S> it.
And when she had opened<S>6605</S> it, she saw<S>7200</S> the child<S>3206</S>: and, behold, the babe<S>5288</S> wept<S>1058</S>. And she had compassion<S>2550</S> on him, and said<S>559</S>, This is one of the Hebrews'<S>5680</S> children<S>3206</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> his sister<S>269</S> to Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> daughter<S>1323</S>, Shall I go<S>3212</S> and call<S>7121</S> to thee a nurse<S>3243</S> of the Hebrew<S>5680</S> women<S>802</S>, that she may nurse<S>3243</S> the child<S>3206</S> for thee?
And Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> daughter<S>1323</S> said<S>559</S> to her, Go<S>3212</S>. And the maid<S>5959</S> went<S>3212</S> and called<S>7121</S> the child's<S>3206</S> mother<S>517</S>.
And Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> daughter<S>1323</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Take<S>3212</S> this child<S>3206</S> away<S>3212</S>, and nurse<S>3243</S> it for me, and I will give<S>5414</S> thee thy wages<S>7939</S>. And the woman<S>802</S> took<S>3947</S> the child<S>3206</S>, and nursed<S>5134</S> it.
And the child<S>3206</S> grew<S>1431</S>, and she brought<S>935</S> him unto Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> daughter<S>1323</S>, and he became her son<S>1121</S>. And she called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Moses<S>4872</S>: and she said<S>559</S>, Because I drew<S>4871</S> him out of the water<S>4325</S>. <sup>Moses: that is, Drawn out</sup>
And it came to pass in those days<S>3117</S>, when Moses<S>4872</S> was grown<S>1431</S>, that he went out<S>3318</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, and looked<S>7200</S> on their burdens<S>5450</S>: and he spied<S>7200</S> an Egyptian<S>4713</S> <S>376</S> smiting<S>5221</S> an Hebrew<S>5680</S>, one of his brethren<S>251</S>.
And he looked<S>6437</S> this way<S>3541</S> and that way<S>3541</S>, and when he saw<S>7200</S> that there was no man<S>376</S>, he slew<S>5221</S> the Egyptian<S>4713</S>, and hid<S>2934</S> him in the sand<S>2344</S>.
And when he went out<S>3318</S> the second<S>8145</S> day<S>3117</S>, behold, two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S> strove<S>5327</S> together: and he said<S>559</S> to him that did the wrong<S>7563</S>, Wherefore smitest<S>5221</S> thou thy fellow<S>7453</S>?
And he said<S>559</S>, Who made<S>7760</S> thee<S>376</S> a prince<S>8269</S> and a judge<S>8199</S> over us? intendest<S>559</S> thou to kill<S>2026</S> me, as thou killedst<S>2026</S> the Egyptian<S>4713</S>? And Moses<S>4872</S> feared<S>3372</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Surely<S>403</S> this thing<S>1697</S> is known<S>3045</S>. <sup>a prince: Heb. a man, a prince</sup>
Now when Pharaoh<S>6547</S> heard<S>8085</S> this thing<S>1697</S>, he sought<S>1245</S> to slay<S>2026</S> Moses<S>4872</S>. But Moses<S>4872</S> fled<S>1272</S> from the face<S>6440</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Midian<S>4080</S>: and he sat down<S>3427</S> by a well<S>875</S>.
Now the priest<S>3548</S> of Midian<S>4080</S> had seven<S>7651</S> daughters<S>1323</S>: and they came<S>935</S> and drew<S>1802</S> water, and filled<S>4390</S> the troughs<S>7298</S> to water<S>8248</S> their father's<S>1</S> flock<S>6629</S>. <sup>priest: or, prince</sup>
And the shepherds<S>7462</S> came<S>935</S> and drove them away<S>1644</S>: but Moses<S>4872</S> stood up<S>6965</S> and helped<S>3467</S> them, and watered<S>8248</S> their flock<S>6629</S>.
And when they came<S>935</S> to Reuel<S>7467</S> their father<S>1</S>, he said<S>559</S>, How<S>4069</S> is it that ye are come<S>935</S> so soon<S>4116</S> to day<S>3117</S>? <sup>Reuel: called also Jethro, or, Jether</sup>
And they said<S>559</S>, An Egyptian<S>4713</S> <S>376</S> delivered<S>5337</S> us out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the shepherds<S>7462</S>, and also drew<S>1802</S> water enough<S>1802</S> for us, and watered<S>8248</S> the flock<S>6629</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his daughters<S>1323</S>, And where is he? why is it that ye have left<S>5800</S> the man<S>376</S>? call<S>7121</S> him, that he may eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> was content<S>2974</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> with the man<S>376</S>: and he gave<S>5414</S> Moses<S>4872</S> Zipporah<S>6855</S> his daughter<S>1323</S>.
And she bare<S>3205</S> him a son<S>1121</S>, and he called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Gershom<S>1647</S>: for he said<S>559</S>, I have been a stranger<S>1616</S> in a strange<S>5237</S> land<S>776</S>. <sup>Gershom: that is, A stranger here</sup>
And it came to pass in process<S>1992</S> <S>7227</S> of time<S>3117</S>, that the king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> died<S>4191</S>: and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> sighed<S>584</S> by reason of<S>4480</S> the bondage<S>5656</S>, and they cried<S>2199</S>, and their cry<S>7775</S> came up<S>5927</S> unto God<S>430</S> by reason of the bondage<S>5656</S>.
And God<S>430</S> heard<S>8085</S> their groaning<S>5009</S>, and God<S>430</S> remembered<S>2142</S> his covenant<S>1285</S> with Abraham<S>85</S>, with Isaac<S>3327</S>, and with Jacob<S>3290</S>.
And God<S>430</S> looked<S>7200</S> upon the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and God<S>430</S> had respect<S>3045</S> unto them. <sup>had: Heb. knew</sup>

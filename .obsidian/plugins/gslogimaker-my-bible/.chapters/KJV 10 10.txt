And it came to pass after this<S>310</S>, that the king<S>4428</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> died<S>4191</S>, and Hanun<S>2586</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
Then said<S>559</S> David<S>1732</S>, I will shew<S>6213</S> kindness<S>2617</S> unto Hanun<S>2586</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nahash<S>5176</S>, as his father<S>1</S> shewed<S>6213</S> kindness<S>2617</S> unto me. And David<S>1732</S> sent<S>7971</S> to comfort<S>5162</S> him by the hand<S>3027</S> of his servants<S>5650</S> for his father<S>1</S>. And David's<S>1732</S> servants<S>5650</S> came<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>.
And the princes<S>8269</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> said<S>559</S> unto Hanun<S>2586</S> their lord<S>113</S>, Thinkest<S>5869</S> thou that David<S>1732</S> doth honour<S>3513</S> thy father<S>1</S>, that he hath sent<S>7971</S> comforters<S>5162</S> unto thee? hath not David<S>1732</S> rather sent<S>7971</S> his servants<S>5650</S> unto thee, to<S>5668</S> search<S>2713</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and to spy it out<S>7270</S>, and to overthrow<S>2015</S> it? <sup>Thinkest: Heb. In thine eyes doth David?</sup>
Wherefore Hanun<S>2586</S> took<S>3947</S> David's<S>1732</S> servants<S>5650</S>, and shaved off<S>1548</S> the one half<S>2677</S> of their beards<S>2206</S>, and cut off<S>3772</S> their garments<S>4063</S> in the middle<S>2677</S>, even to their buttocks<S>8357</S>, and sent them away<S>7971</S>.
When they told<S>5046</S> it unto David<S>1732</S>, he sent<S>7971</S> to meet<S>7125</S> them, because the men<S>582</S> were greatly<S>3966</S> ashamed<S>3637</S>: and the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Tarry<S>3427</S> at Jericho<S>3405</S> until your beards<S>2206</S> be grown<S>6779</S>, and then return<S>7725</S>.
And when the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> saw<S>7200</S> that they stank<S>887</S> before David<S>1732</S>, the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> sent<S>7971</S> and hired<S>7936</S> the Syrians<S>758</S> of Bethrehob<S>1050</S>, and the Syrians<S>758</S> of Zoba<S>6678</S>, twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> footmen<S>7273</S>, and of king<S>4428</S> Maacah<S>4601</S> a thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>, and of Ishtob<S>382</S> twelve<S>6240</S> <S>8147</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>. <sup>Ishtob: or, the men of Tob</sup>
And when David<S>1732</S> heard<S>8085</S> of it, he sent<S>7971</S> Joab<S>3097</S>, and all the host<S>6635</S> of the mighty men<S>1368</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> came out<S>3318</S>, and put the battle<S>4421</S> in array<S>6186</S> at the entering in<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>: and the Syrians<S>758</S> of Zoba<S>6678</S>, and of Rehob<S>7340</S>, and Ishtob<S>382</S>, and Maacah<S>4601</S>, were by themselves<S>905</S> in the field<S>7704</S>.
When Joab<S>3097</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the front<S>6440</S> of the battle<S>4421</S> was against him before<S>6440</S> and behind<S>268</S>, he chose<S>977</S> of all the choice<S>977</S> men of Israel<S>3478</S>, and put them in array<S>6186</S> against<S>7125</S> the Syrians<S>758</S>:
And the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S> he delivered<S>5414</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of Abishai<S>52</S> his brother<S>251</S>, that he might put them in array<S>6186</S> against<S>7125</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, If the Syrians<S>758</S> be too strong<S>2388</S> for me, then thou shalt help<S>3444</S> me: but if the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> be too strong<S>2388</S> for thee, then I will come<S>1980</S> and help<S>3467</S> thee.
Be of good courage<S>2388</S>, and let us play the men<S>2388</S> for our people<S>5971</S>, and for the cities<S>5892</S> of our God<S>430</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> do<S>6213</S> that which seemeth<S>5869</S> him good<S>2896</S>.
And Joab<S>3097</S> drew nigh<S>5066</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> that were with him, unto the battle<S>4421</S> against the Syrians<S>758</S>: and they fled<S>5127</S> before<S>6440</S> him.
And when the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the Syrians<S>758</S> were fled<S>5127</S>, then fled<S>5127</S> they also before<S>6440</S> Abishai<S>52</S>, and entered<S>935</S> into the city<S>5892</S>. So Joab<S>3097</S> returned<S>7725</S> from the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And when the Syrians<S>758</S> saw<S>7200</S> that they were smitten<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, they gathered<S>622</S> themselves together<S>3162</S>.
And Hadarezer<S>1928</S> sent<S>7971</S>, and brought out<S>3318</S> the Syrians<S>758</S> that were beyond<S>5676</S> the river<S>5104</S>: and they came<S>935</S> to Helam<S>2431</S>; and Shobach<S>7731</S> the captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S> of Hadarezer<S>1928</S> went before<S>6440</S> them. <sup>the river: that is, Euphrates</sup> <sup>Shobach: or, Shophach</sup>
And when it was told<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S>, he gathered<S>622</S> all Israel<S>3478</S> together<S>622</S>, and passed over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Helam<S>2431</S>. And the Syrians<S>758</S> set themselves in array<S>6186</S> against<S>7125</S> David<S>1732</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with him.
And the Syrians<S>758</S> fled<S>5127</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>; and David<S>1732</S> slew<S>2026</S> the men of seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chariots<S>7393</S> of the Syrians<S>758</S>, and forty<S>705</S> thousand<S>505</S> horsemen<S>6571</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> Shobach<S>7731</S> the captain<S>8269</S> of their host<S>6635</S>, who died<S>4191</S> there.
And when all the kings<S>4428</S> that were servants<S>5650</S> to Hadarezer<S>1928</S> saw<S>7200</S> that they were smitten<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, they made peace<S>7999</S> with Israel<S>3478</S>, and served<S>5647</S> them. So the Syrians<S>758</S> feared<S>3372</S> to help<S>3467</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> any more.

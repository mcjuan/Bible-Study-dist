And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Yet will I bring<S>935</S> one<S>259</S> plague<S>5061</S> more upon Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and upon Egypt<S>4714</S>; afterwards<S>310</S> he will let you go<S>7971</S> hence: when he shall let you go<S>7971</S>, he shall surely<S>1644</S> thrust you out<S>1644</S> hence altogether<S>3617</S>.
Speak<S>1696</S> now in the ears<S>241</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, and let every man<S>376</S> borrow<S>7592</S> of his neighbour<S>7453</S>, and every woman<S>802</S> of her neighbour<S>7468</S>, jewels<S>3627</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and jewels<S>3627</S> of gold<S>2091</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> gave<S>5414</S> the people<S>5971</S> favour<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S>. Moreover the man<S>376</S> Moses<S>4872</S> was very<S>3966</S> great<S>1419</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, in the sight<S>5869</S> of Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> servants<S>5650</S>, and in the sight<S>5869</S> of the people<S>5971</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, About midnight<S>3915</S> <S>2676</S> will I go out<S>3318</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>:
And all the firstborn<S>1060</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> shall die<S>4191</S>, from the firstborn<S>1060</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> that sitteth<S>3427</S> upon his throne<S>3678</S>, even unto the firstborn<S>1060</S> of the maidservant<S>8198</S> that is behind<S>310</S> the mill<S>7347</S>; and all the firstborn<S>1060</S> of beasts<S>929</S>.
And there shall be<S>1961</S> a great<S>1419</S> cry<S>6818</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, such as there was none<S>3808</S> like it, nor<S>3808</S> shall be like it any more<S>3254</S>.
But against any of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall not a dog<S>3611</S> move<S>2782</S> his tongue<S>3956</S>, against man<S>376</S> or beast<S>929</S>: that ye may know<S>3045</S> how that the LORD<S>3068</S> doth put a difference<S>6395</S> between the Egyptians<S>4714</S> and Israel<S>3478</S>.
And all these thy servants<S>5650</S> shall come down<S>3381</S> unto me, and bow down<S>7812</S> themselves unto me, saying<S>559</S>, Get thee out<S>3318</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> that follow<S>7272</S> thee: and after<S>310</S> that I will go out<S>3318</S>. And he went out<S>3318</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S> in a great<S>2750</S> anger<S>639</S>. <sup>that follow: Heb. that is at thy feet</sup> <sup>a great: Heb. heat of anger</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Pharaoh<S>6547</S> shall not hearken<S>8085</S> unto you; that my wonders<S>4159</S> may be multiplied<S>7235</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> did<S>6213</S> all these wonders<S>4159</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> hardened<S>2388</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S>, so that he would not let the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> go out<S>7971</S> of his land<S>776</S>.

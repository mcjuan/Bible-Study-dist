And it came to pass at the end<S>7093</S> of two full<S>3117</S> years<S>8141</S>, that Pharaoh<S>6547</S> dreamed<S>2492</S>: and, behold, he stood<S>5975</S> by the river<S>2975</S>.
And, behold, there came up<S>5927</S> out of the river<S>2975</S> seven<S>7651</S> well<S>3303</S> favoured<S>4758</S> kine<S>6510</S> and fatfleshed<S>1277</S> <S>1320</S>; and they fed<S>7462</S> in a meadow<S>260</S>.
And, behold, seven<S>7651</S> other<S>312</S> kine<S>6510</S> came up<S>5927</S> after them<S>310</S> out of the river<S>2975</S>, ill<S>7451</S> favoured<S>4758</S> and leanfleshed<S>1851</S> <S>1320</S>; and stood<S>5975</S> by<S>681</S> the other kine<S>6510</S> upon the brink<S>8193</S> of the river<S>2975</S>.
And the ill<S>7451</S> favoured<S>4758</S> and leanfleshed<S>1851</S> <S>1320</S> kine<S>6510</S> did eat up<S>398</S> the seven<S>7651</S> well<S>3303</S> favoured<S>4758</S> and fat<S>1277</S> kine<S>6510</S>. So Pharaoh<S>6547</S> awoke<S>3364</S>.
And he slept<S>3462</S> and dreamed<S>2492</S> the second time<S>8145</S>: and, behold, seven<S>7651</S> ears of corn<S>7641</S> came up<S>5927</S> upon one<S>259</S> stalk<S>7070</S>, rank<S>1277</S> and good<S>2896</S>. <sup>rank: Heb. fat</sup>
And, behold, seven<S>7651</S> thin<S>1851</S> ears<S>7641</S> and blasted<S>7710</S> with the east wind<S>6921</S> sprung up<S>6779</S> after them<S>310</S>.
And the seven thin<S>1851</S> ears<S>7641</S> devoured<S>1104</S> the seven<S>7651</S> rank<S>1277</S> and full<S>4392</S> ears<S>7641</S>. And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> awoke<S>3364</S>, and, behold, it was a dream<S>2472</S>.
And it came to pass in the morning<S>1242</S> that his spirit<S>7307</S> was troubled<S>6470</S>; and he sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> for all the magicians<S>2748</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and all the wise men<S>2450</S> thereof: and Pharaoh<S>6547</S> told<S>5608</S> them his dream<S>2472</S>; but there was none that could interpret<S>6622</S> them unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
Then spake<S>1696</S> the chief<S>8269</S> butler<S>8248</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I do remember<S>2142</S> my faults<S>2399</S> this day<S>3117</S>:
Pharaoh<S>6547</S> was wroth<S>7107</S> with his servants<S>5650</S>, and put<S>5414</S> me in ward<S>4929</S> in the captain<S>8269</S> of the guard's<S>2876</S> house<S>1004</S>, both me and the chief<S>8269</S> baker<S>644</S>:
And we dreamed<S>2492</S> a dream<S>2472</S> in one<S>259</S> night<S>3915</S>, I and he; we dreamed<S>2492</S> each man<S>376</S> according to the interpretation<S>6623</S> of his dream<S>2472</S>.
And there was there with us a young man<S>5288</S>, an Hebrew<S>5680</S>, servant<S>5650</S> to the captain<S>8269</S> of the guard<S>2876</S>; and we told<S>5608</S> him, and he interpreted<S>6622</S> to us our dreams<S>2472</S>; to each man<S>376</S> according to his dream<S>2472</S> he did interpret<S>6622</S>.
And it came to pass, as he interpreted<S>6622</S> to us, so it was; me he restored<S>7725</S> unto mine office<S>3653</S>, and him he hanged<S>8518</S>.
Then Pharaoh<S>6547</S> sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> Joseph<S>3130</S>, and they brought him hastily<S>7323</S> out of the dungeon<S>953</S>: and he shaved<S>1548</S> himself, and changed<S>2498</S> his raiment<S>8071</S>, and came in<S>935</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>. <sup>brought: Heb. made him run</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, I have dreamed<S>2492</S> a dream<S>2472</S>, and there is none that can interpret<S>6622</S> it: and I have heard<S>8085</S> say<S>559</S> of thee, that thou canst understand<S>8085</S> a dream<S>2472</S> to interpret<S>6622</S> it. <sup>thou: or, when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> answered<S>6030</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, saying<S>559</S>, It is not in me<S>1107</S>: God<S>430</S> shall give<S>6030</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S> an answer<S>6030</S> of peace<S>7965</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>1696</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, In my dream<S>2472</S>, behold, I stood<S>5975</S> upon the bank<S>8193</S> of the river<S>2975</S>:
And, behold, there came up<S>5927</S> out of the river<S>2975</S> seven<S>7651</S> kine<S>6510</S>, fatfleshed<S>1277</S> <S>1320</S> and well<S>3303</S> favoured<S>8389</S>; and they fed<S>7462</S> in a meadow<S>260</S>:
And, behold, seven<S>7651</S> other<S>312</S> kine<S>6510</S> came up<S>5927</S> after them<S>310</S>, poor<S>1803</S> and very<S>3966</S> ill<S>7451</S> favoured<S>8389</S> and leanfleshed<S>7534</S> <S>1320</S>, such<S>2007</S> as I never<S>3808</S> saw<S>7200</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> for badness<S>7455</S>:
And the lean<S>7534</S> and the ill favoured<S>7451</S> kine<S>6510</S> did eat up<S>398</S> the first<S>7223</S> seven<S>7651</S> fat<S>1277</S> kine<S>6510</S>:
And when they had eaten them up<S>935</S> <S>7130</S>, it could not be known<S>3045</S> that they had eaten them<S>935</S> <S>7130</S>; but they were still<S>4758</S> ill favoured<S>7451</S>, as at the beginning<S>8462</S>. So I awoke<S>3364</S>. <sup>eaten: Heb. come to the inward parts of them</sup>
And I saw<S>7200</S> in my dream<S>2472</S>, and, behold, seven<S>7651</S> ears<S>7641</S> came up<S>5927</S> in one<S>259</S> stalk<S>7070</S>, full<S>4392</S> and good<S>2896</S>:
And, behold, seven<S>7651</S> ears<S>7641</S>, withered<S>6798</S>, thin<S>1851</S>, and blasted<S>7710</S> with the east wind<S>6921</S>, sprung up<S>6779</S> after them<S>310</S>: <sup>withered: or, small</sup>
And the thin<S>1851</S> ears<S>7641</S> devoured<S>1104</S> the seven<S>7651</S> good<S>2896</S> ears<S>7641</S>: and I told<S>559</S> this unto the magicians<S>2748</S>; but there was none that could declare<S>5046</S> it to me.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, The dream<S>2472</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> is one<S>259</S>: God<S>430</S> hath shewed<S>5046</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S> what he is about to do<S>6213</S>.
The seven<S>7651</S> good<S>2896</S> kine<S>6510</S> are seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>; and the seven<S>7651</S> good<S>2896</S> ears<S>7641</S> are seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>: the dream<S>2472</S> is one<S>259</S>.
And the seven<S>7651</S> thin<S>7534</S> and ill favoured<S>7451</S> kine<S>6510</S> that came up<S>5927</S> after them<S>310</S> are seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>; and the seven<S>7651</S> empty<S>7386</S> ears<S>7641</S> blasted<S>7710</S> with the east wind<S>6921</S> shall be seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> of famine<S>7458</S>.
This is the thing<S>1697</S> which I have spoken<S>1696</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: What God<S>430</S> is about to do<S>6213</S> he sheweth<S>7200</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
Behold, there come<S>935</S> seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> of great<S>1419</S> plenty<S>7647</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>:
And there shall arise<S>6965</S> after them<S>310</S> seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> of famine<S>7458</S>; and all the plenty<S>7647</S> shall be forgotten<S>7911</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; and the famine<S>7458</S> shall consume<S>3615</S> the land<S>776</S>;
And the plenty<S>7647</S> shall not be known<S>3045</S> in the land<S>776</S> by reason<S>6440</S> of that famine<S>7458</S> following<S>310</S> <S>3651</S>; for it shall be very<S>3966</S> grievous<S>3515</S>. <sup>grievous: Heb. heavy</sup>
And for that the dream<S>2472</S> was doubled<S>8138</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S> twice<S>6471</S>; it is because the thing<S>1697</S> is established<S>3559</S> by<S>5973</S> God<S>430</S>, and God<S>430</S> will shortly<S>4116</S> bring it to pass<S>6213</S>. <sup>established: or, prepared of God</sup>
Now therefore let Pharaoh<S>6547</S> look out<S>7200</S> a man<S>376</S> discreet<S>995</S> and wise<S>2450</S>, and set<S>7896</S> him over the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Let Pharaoh<S>6547</S> do<S>6213</S> this, and let him appoint<S>6485</S> officers<S>6496</S> over the land<S>776</S>, and take up the fifth part<S>2567</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> in the seven<S>7651</S> plenteous<S>7647</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>officers: or, overseers</sup>
And let them gather<S>6908</S> all the food<S>400</S> of those good<S>2896</S> years<S>8141</S> that come<S>935</S>, and lay up<S>6651</S> corn<S>1250</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and let them keep<S>8104</S> food<S>400</S> in the cities<S>5892</S>.
And that food<S>400</S> shall be for store<S>6487</S> to the land<S>776</S> against the seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> of famine<S>7458</S>, which shall be in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; that the land<S>776</S> perish<S>3772</S> not through the famine<S>7458</S>. <sup>perish: Heb. be not cut off</sup>
And the thing<S>1697</S> was good<S>3190</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and in the eyes<S>5869</S> of all his servants<S>5650</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto his servants<S>5650</S>, Can we find<S>4672</S> such a one as this<S>2088</S> is, a man<S>376</S> in whom<S>834</S> the Spirit<S>7307</S> of God<S>430</S> is?
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, Forasmuch<S>310</S> as God<S>430</S> hath shewed<S>3045</S> thee all this, there is none so discreet<S>995</S> and wise<S>2450</S> as thou art:
Thou shalt be<S>1961</S> over my house<S>1004</S>, and according unto thy word<S>6310</S> shall all my people<S>5971</S> be ruled<S>5401</S>: only in the throne<S>3678</S> will I be greater<S>1431</S> than thou. <sup>be ruled: Heb. be armed, or, kiss</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, See<S>7200</S>, I have set<S>5414</S> thee over all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> took off<S>5493</S> his ring<S>2885</S> from his hand<S>3027</S>, and put<S>5414</S> it upon Joseph's<S>3130</S> hand<S>3027</S>, and arrayed<S>3847</S> him in vestures<S>899</S> of fine linen<S>8336</S>, and put<S>7760</S> a gold<S>2091</S> chain<S>7242</S> about his neck<S>6677</S>; <sup>fine: or, silk</sup>
And he made him to ride<S>7392</S> in the second<S>4932</S> chariot<S>4818</S> which he had; and they cried<S>7121</S> before him<S>6440</S>, Bow the knee<S>86</S>: and he made<S>5414</S> him ruler over all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. <sup>Bow: or, Tender father: Heb. Abrech</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, I am Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and without<S>1107</S> thee shall no man<S>376</S> lift up<S>7311</S> his hand<S>3027</S> or foot<S>7272</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> called<S>7121</S> Joseph's<S>3130</S> name<S>8034</S> Zaphnathpaaneah<S>6847</S>; and he gave<S>5414</S> him to wife<S>802</S> Asenath<S>621</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Potipherah<S>6319</S> priest<S>3548</S> of On<S>204</S>. And Joseph<S>3130</S> went out<S>3318</S> over all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. <sup>Zaphnathpaaneah: which in the Coptic signifies, A revealer of secrets, or, The man to whom secrets are revealed</sup> <sup>priest: or, prince</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> was thirty<S>7970</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. And Joseph<S>3130</S> went out<S>3318</S> from the presence<S>6440</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and went throughout<S>5674</S> all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And in the seven<S>7651</S> plenteous<S>7647</S> years<S>8141</S> the earth<S>776</S> brought forth<S>6213</S> by handfuls<S>7062</S>.
And he gathered up<S>6908</S> all the food<S>400</S> of the seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>, which were in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and laid up<S>5414</S> the food<S>400</S> in the cities<S>5892</S>: the food<S>400</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, which was round about<S>5439</S> every city<S>5892</S>, laid he up<S>5414</S> in the same<S>8432</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> gathered<S>6651</S> corn<S>1250</S> as the sand<S>2344</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>, very<S>3966</S> much<S>7235</S>, until he left<S>2308</S> numbering<S>5608</S>; for it was without<S>369</S> number<S>4557</S>.
And unto Joseph<S>3130</S> were born<S>3205</S> two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> before the years<S>8141</S> of famine<S>7458</S> came<S>935</S>, which Asenath<S>621</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Potipherah<S>6319</S> priest<S>3548</S> of On<S>204</S> bare<S>3205</S> unto him. <sup>priest: or, prince</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the firstborn<S>1060</S> Manasseh<S>4519</S>: For God<S>430</S>, said he, hath made me forget<S>5382</S> all my toil<S>5999</S>, and all my father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>. <sup>Manasseh: that is, Forgetting</sup>

And the seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> of dearth<S>7458</S> began<S>2490</S> to come<S>935</S>, according as Joseph<S>3130</S> had said<S>559</S>: and the dearth<S>7458</S> was in all lands<S>776</S>; but in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> there was bread<S>3899</S>.
And when all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> was famished<S>7456</S>, the people<S>5971</S> cried<S>6817</S> to Pharaoh<S>6547</S> for bread<S>3899</S>: and Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the Egyptians<S>4714</S>, Go<S>3212</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>; what he saith<S>559</S> to you, do<S>6213</S>.

O give thanks<S>3034</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; call<S>7121</S> upon his name<S>8034</S>: make known<S>3045</S> his deeds<S>5949</S> among the people<S>5971</S>.
Sing<S>7891</S> unto him, sing psalms<S>2167</S> unto him: talk<S>7878</S> ye of all his wondrous works<S>6381</S>.
Glory<S>1984</S> ye in his holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>: let the heart<S>3820</S> of them rejoice<S>8055</S> that seek<S>1245</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and his strength<S>5797</S>: seek<S>1245</S> his face<S>6440</S> evermore<S>8548</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> his marvellous works<S>6381</S> that he hath done<S>6213</S>; his wonders<S>4159</S>, and the judgments<S>4941</S> of his mouth<S>6310</S>;
O ye seed<S>2233</S> of Abraham<S>85</S> his servant<S>5650</S>, ye children<S>1121</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> his chosen<S>972</S>.
He is the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>: his judgments<S>4941</S> are in all the earth<S>776</S>.
He hath remembered<S>2142</S> his covenant<S>1285</S> for ever<S>5769</S>, the word<S>1697</S> which he commanded<S>6680</S> to a thousand<S>505</S> generations<S>1755</S>.
Which covenant he made<S>3772</S> with Abraham<S>85</S>, and his oath<S>7621</S> unto Isaac<S>3446</S>;
And confirmed<S>5975</S> the same unto Jacob<S>3290</S> for a law<S>2706</S>, and to Israel<S>3478</S> for an everlasting<S>5769</S> covenant<S>1285</S>:
Saying<S>559</S>, Unto thee will I give<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, the lot<S>2256</S> of your inheritance<S>5159</S>: <sup>lot: Heb. cord</sup>
When they were but a few men<S>4962</S> in number<S>4557</S>; yea, very few<S>4592</S>, and strangers<S>1481</S> in it.
When they went<S>1980</S> from one nation<S>1471</S> to another, from one kingdom<S>4467</S> to another<S>312</S> people<S>5971</S>;
He suffered<S>3240</S> no man<S>120</S> to do them wrong<S>6231</S>: yea, he reproved<S>3198</S> kings<S>4428</S> for their sakes;
Saying, Touch<S>5060</S> not mine anointed<S>4899</S>, and do my prophets<S>5030</S> no harm<S>7489</S>.
Moreover he called<S>7121</S> for a famine<S>7458</S> upon the land<S>776</S>: he brake<S>7665</S> the whole staff<S>4294</S> of bread<S>3899</S>.
He sent<S>7971</S> a man<S>376</S> before<S>6440</S> them, even Joseph<S>3130</S>, who was sold<S>4376</S> for a servant<S>5650</S>:
Whose feet<S>7272</S> they hurt<S>6031</S> with fetters<S>3525</S>: he<S>5315</S> was laid<S>935</S> in iron<S>1270</S>: <sup>he: Heb. his soul came into iron</sup>
Until the time<S>6256</S> that his word<S>1697</S> came<S>935</S>: the word<S>565</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> tried<S>6884</S> him.
The king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S> and loosed<S>5425</S> him; even the ruler<S>4910</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, and let him go free<S>6605</S>.
He made<S>7760</S> him lord<S>113</S> of his house<S>1004</S>, and ruler<S>4910</S> of all his substance<S>7075</S>: <sup>substance: Heb. possession</sup>
To bind<S>631</S> his princes<S>8269</S> at his pleasure<S>5315</S>; and teach his senators<S>2205</S> wisdom<S>2449</S>.
Israel<S>3478</S> also came<S>935</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>; and Jacob<S>3290</S> sojourned<S>1481</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Ham<S>2526</S>.
And he increased<S>6509</S> his people<S>5971</S> greatly<S>3966</S>; and made them stronger<S>6105</S> than their enemies<S>6862</S>.
He turned<S>2015</S> their heart<S>3820</S> to hate<S>8130</S> his people<S>5971</S>, to deal subtilly<S>5230</S> with his servants<S>5650</S>.
He sent<S>7971</S> Moses<S>4872</S> his servant<S>5650</S>; and Aaron<S>175</S> whom he had chosen<S>977</S>.
They shewed<S>7760</S> his signs<S>226</S> <S>1697</S> among them, and wonders<S>4159</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Ham<S>2526</S>. <sup>his: Heb. words of his signs</sup>
He sent<S>7971</S> darkness<S>2822</S>, and made it dark<S>2821</S>; and they rebelled<S>4784</S> not against his word<S>1697</S>.
He turned<S>2015</S> their waters<S>4325</S> into blood<S>1818</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> their fish<S>1710</S>.
Their land<S>776</S> brought forth<S>8317</S> frogs<S>6854</S> in abundance<S>8317</S>, in the chambers<S>2315</S> of their kings<S>4428</S>.
He spake<S>559</S>, and there came<S>935</S> divers sorts of flies<S>6157</S>, and lice<S>3654</S> in all their coasts<S>1366</S>.
He gave<S>5414</S> them hail<S>1259</S> for rain<S>1653</S>, and flaming<S>3852</S> fire<S>784</S> in their land<S>776</S>. <sup>them: Heb. their rain hail</sup>
He smote<S>5221</S> their vines<S>1612</S> also and their fig trees<S>8384</S>; and brake<S>7665</S> the trees<S>6086</S> of their coasts<S>1366</S>.
He spake<S>559</S>, and the locusts<S>697</S> came<S>935</S>, and caterpillers<S>3218</S>, and that without number<S>4557</S>,
And did eat up<S>398</S> all the herbs<S>6212</S> in their land<S>776</S>, and devoured<S>398</S> the fruit<S>6529</S> of their ground<S>127</S>.
He smote<S>5221</S> also all the firstborn<S>1060</S> in their land<S>776</S>, the chief<S>7225</S> of all their strength<S>202</S>.
He brought them forth<S>3318</S> also with silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>: and there was not one feeble<S>3782</S> person among their tribes<S>7626</S>.
Egypt<S>4714</S> was glad<S>8055</S> when they departed<S>3318</S>: for the fear<S>6343</S> of them fell<S>5307</S> upon them.
He spread<S>6566</S> a cloud<S>6051</S> for a covering<S>4539</S>; and fire<S>784</S> to give light<S>215</S> in the night<S>3915</S>.
The people asked<S>7592</S>, and he brought<S>935</S> quails<S>7958</S>, and satisfied<S>7646</S> them with the bread<S>3899</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>.
He opened<S>6605</S> the rock<S>6697</S>, and the waters<S>4325</S> gushed out<S>2100</S>; they ran<S>1980</S> in the dry places<S>6723</S> like a river<S>5104</S>.
For he remembered<S>2142</S> his holy<S>6944</S> promise<S>1697</S>, and Abraham<S>85</S> his servant<S>5650</S>.
And he brought forth<S>3318</S> his people<S>5971</S> with joy<S>8342</S>, and his chosen<S>972</S> with gladness<S>7440</S>: <sup>gladness: Heb. singing</sup>
And gave<S>5414</S> them the lands<S>776</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>: and they inherited<S>3423</S> the labour<S>5999</S> of the people<S>3816</S>;
That they might observe<S>8104</S> his statutes<S>2706</S>, and keep<S>5341</S> his laws<S>8451</S>. Praise<S>1984</S> ye the LORD<S>3050</S>. <sup>Praise: Heb. Hallelujah</sup>

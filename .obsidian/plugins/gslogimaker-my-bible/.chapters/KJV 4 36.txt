And the chief<S>7218</S> fathers<S>1</S> of the families<S>4940</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Machir<S>4353</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, of the families<S>4940</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, came near<S>7126</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> before<S>6440</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, and before<S>6440</S> the princes<S>5387</S>, the chief<S>7218</S> fathers<S>1</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:
And they said<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> my lord<S>113</S> to give<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> for an inheritance<S>5159</S> by lot<S>1486</S> to the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and my lord<S>113</S> was commanded<S>6680</S> by the LORD<S>3068</S> to give<S>5414</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S> our brother<S>251</S> unto his daughters<S>1323</S>.
And if they be married<S>802</S> to any<S>259</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of the other tribes<S>7626</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, then shall their inheritance<S>5159</S> be taken<S>1639</S> from the inheritance<S>5159</S> of our fathers<S>1</S>, and shall be put<S>3254</S> to the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken<S>1639</S> from the lot<S>1486</S> of our inheritance<S>5159</S>. <sup>whereunto: Heb. unto whom they shall be</sup>
And when the jubile<S>3104</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall be, then shall their inheritance<S>5159</S> be put<S>3254</S> unto the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance<S>5159</S> be taken away<S>1639</S> from the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> of our fathers<S>1</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> commanded<S>6680</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> according to the word<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The tribe<S>4294</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S> hath said<S>1696</S> well.
This is the thing<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> doth command<S>6680</S> concerning the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Let them marry<S>802</S> to whom they think<S>5869</S> best<S>2896</S>; only to the family<S>4940</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> of their father<S>1</S> shall they marry<S>802</S>. <sup>marry: Heb. be wives</sup>
So shall not the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> remove<S>5437</S> from tribe<S>4294</S> to tribe<S>4294</S>: for every one<S>376</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall keep<S>1692</S> himself to the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> of his fathers<S>1</S>. <sup>keep: Heb. cleave to the, etc</sup>
And every daughter<S>1323</S>, that possesseth<S>3423</S> an inheritance<S>5159</S> in any tribe<S>4294</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, shall be wife<S>802</S> unto one<S>259</S> of the family<S>4940</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> of her father<S>1</S>, that the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> may enjoy<S>3423</S> every man<S>376</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> of his fathers<S>1</S>.
Neither shall the inheritance<S>5159</S> remove<S>5437</S> from one tribe<S>4294</S> to another<S>312</S> tribe<S>4294</S>; but every one<S>376</S> of the tribes<S>4294</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall keep<S>1692</S> himself to his own inheritance<S>5159</S>.
Even as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, so did<S>6213</S> the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S>:
For Mahlah<S>4244</S>, Tirzah<S>8656</S>, and Hoglah<S>2295</S>, and Milcah<S>4435</S>, and Noah<S>5270</S>, the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S>, were married<S>802</S> unto their father's<S>1730</S> brothers' sons<S>1121</S>:
And they were married<S>802</S> into the families<S>4940</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, and their inheritance<S>5159</S> remained in the tribe<S>4294</S> of the family<S>4940</S> of their father<S>1</S>. <sup>into: Heb. to some that were of the families</sup>
These are the commandments<S>4687</S> and the judgments<S>4941</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in the plains<S>6160</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> by Jordan<S>3383</S> near Jericho<S>3405</S>.

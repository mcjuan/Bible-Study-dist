And Joseph<S>3130</S> was brought down<S>3381</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S>; and Potiphar<S>6318</S>, an officer<S>5631</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, captain<S>8269</S> of the guard<S>2876</S>, an Egyptian<S>376</S> <S>4713</S>, bought<S>7069</S> him of the hands<S>3027</S> of the Ishmeelites<S>3459</S>, which had brought him down<S>3381</S> thither.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was with Joseph<S>3130</S>, and he was a prosperous<S>6743</S> man<S>376</S>; and he was in the house<S>1004</S> of his master<S>113</S> the Egyptian<S>4713</S>.
And his master<S>113</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> was with him, and that the LORD<S>3068</S> made all that he did<S>6213</S> to prosper<S>6743</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> found<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in his sight<S>5869</S>, and he served<S>8334</S> him: and he made him overseer<S>6485</S> over his house<S>1004</S>, and all that he had<S>3426</S> he put<S>5414</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>.
And it came to pass from the time<S>227</S> that he had made him overseer<S>6485</S> in his house<S>1004</S>, and over all that he had<S>3426</S>, that the LORD<S>3068</S> blessed<S>1288</S> the Egyptian's<S>4713</S> house<S>1004</S> for Joseph's<S>3130</S> sake<S>1558</S>; and the blessing<S>1293</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was upon all that he had<S>3426</S> in the house<S>1004</S>, and in the field<S>7704</S>.
And he left<S>5800</S> all that he had in Joseph's<S>3130</S> hand<S>3027</S>; and he knew<S>3045</S> not ought<S>3972</S> he had, save<S>518</S> the bread<S>3899</S> which he did eat<S>398</S>. And Joseph<S>3130</S> was a goodly<S>8389</S> person, and well<S>3303</S> favoured<S>4758</S>.
And it came to pass after<S>310</S> these things<S>1697</S>, that his master's<S>113</S> wife<S>802</S> cast<S>5375</S> her eyes<S>5869</S> upon Joseph<S>3130</S>; and she said<S>559</S>, Lie<S>7901</S> with me.
But he refused<S>3985</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto his master's<S>113</S> wife<S>802</S>, Behold, my master<S>113</S> wotteth<S>3045</S> not what is with me in the house<S>1004</S>, and he hath committed<S>5414</S> all that he hath<S>3426</S> to my hand<S>3027</S>;
There is none greater<S>1419</S> in this house<S>1004</S> than I; neither<S>3808</S> hath he kept back<S>2820</S> any thing<S>3972</S> from me but thee, because<S>834</S> thou<S>859</S> art his wife<S>802</S>: how then can I do<S>6213</S> this great<S>1419</S> wickedness<S>7451</S>, and sin<S>2398</S> against God<S>430</S>?
And it came to pass, as she spake<S>1696</S> to Joseph<S>3130</S> day<S>3117</S> by day<S>3117</S>, that he hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto her, to lie<S>7901</S> by her<S>681</S>, or to be with her.
And it came to pass about this time<S>3117</S>, that Joseph went<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> to do<S>6213</S> his business<S>4399</S>; and there was none of the men<S>376</S> <S>582</S> of the house<S>1004</S> there within.
And she caught<S>8610</S> him by his garment<S>899</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Lie<S>7901</S> with me: and he left<S>5800</S> his garment<S>899</S> in her hand<S>3027</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>, and got<S>3318</S> him out<S>2351</S>.
And it came to pass, when she saw<S>7200</S> that he had left<S>5800</S> his garment<S>899</S> in her hand<S>3027</S>, and was fled<S>5127</S> forth<S>2351</S>,
That she called<S>7121</S> unto the men<S>582</S> of her house<S>1004</S>, and spake<S>559</S> unto them, saying<S>559</S>, See<S>7200</S>, he hath brought in<S>935</S> an Hebrew<S>376</S> <S>5680</S> unto us to mock<S>6711</S> us; he came in<S>935</S> unto me to lie<S>7901</S> with me, and I cried<S>7121</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>: <sup>loud: Heb. great</sup>
And it came to pass, when he heard<S>8085</S> that I lifted up<S>7311</S> my voice<S>6963</S> and cried<S>7121</S>, that he left<S>5800</S> his garment<S>899</S> with me<S>681</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>, and got him<S>3318</S> out<S>2351</S>.
And she laid up<S>3240</S> his garment<S>899</S> by her<S>681</S>, until his lord<S>113</S> came<S>935</S> home<S>1004</S>.
And she spake<S>1696</S> unto him according to these words<S>1697</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The Hebrew<S>5680</S> servant<S>5650</S>, which thou hast brought<S>935</S> unto us, came in<S>935</S> unto me to mock<S>6711</S> me:
And it came to pass, as I lifted up<S>7311</S> my voice<S>6963</S> and cried<S>7121</S>, that he left<S>5800</S> his garment<S>899</S> with me<S>681</S>, and fled<S>5127</S> out<S>2351</S>.
And it came to pass, when his master<S>113</S> heard<S>8085</S> the words<S>1697</S> of his wife<S>802</S>, which she spake<S>1696</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, After this manner<S>1697</S> did<S>6213</S> thy servant<S>5650</S> to me; that his wrath<S>639</S> was kindled<S>2734</S>.
And Joseph's<S>3130</S> master<S>113</S> took<S>3947</S> him, and put him<S>5414</S> into the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S>, a place<S>4725</S> where the king's<S>4428</S> prisoners<S>615</S> were bound<S>631</S>: and he was there in the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S>.
But the LORD<S>3068</S> was with Joseph<S>3130</S>, and shewed<S>5186</S> him mercy<S>2617</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> him favour<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the keeper<S>8269</S> of the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S>. <sup>shewed: Heb. extended kindness unto him</sup>
And the keeper<S>8269</S> of the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S> committed<S>5414</S> to Joseph's<S>3130</S> hand<S>3027</S> all the prisoners<S>615</S> that were in the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S>; and whatsoever they did<S>6213</S> there, he was the doer<S>6213</S> of it.
The keeper<S>8269</S> of the prison<S>1004</S> <S>5470</S> looked<S>7200</S> not to any thing<S>3972</S> that was under his hand<S>3027</S>; because the LORD<S>3068</S> was with him, and that which he did<S>6213</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> made it to prosper<S>6743</S>.

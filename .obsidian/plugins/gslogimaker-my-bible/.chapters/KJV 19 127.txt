A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S> for Solomon<S>8010</S>. Except the LORD<S>3068</S> build<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S>, they labour<S>5998</S> in vain<S>7723</S> that build<S>1129</S> it: except the LORD<S>3068</S> keep<S>8104</S> the city<S>5892</S>, the watchman<S>8104</S> waketh<S>8245</S> but in vain<S>7723</S>. <sup>for: or, of Solomon</sup> <sup>that: Heb. that are builders of it in it</sup>
It is vain<S>7723</S> for you to rise up<S>6965</S> early<S>7925</S>, to sit up<S>3427</S> late<S>309</S>, to eat<S>398</S> the bread<S>3899</S> of sorrows<S>6089</S>: for so he giveth<S>5414</S> his beloved<S>3039</S> sleep<S>8142</S>.
Lo, children<S>1121</S> are an heritage<S>5159</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and the fruit<S>6529</S> of the womb<S>990</S> is his reward<S>7939</S>.
As arrows<S>2671</S> are in the hand<S>3027</S> of a mighty man<S>1368</S>; so are children<S>1121</S> of the youth<S>5271</S>.
Happy<S>835</S> is the man<S>1397</S> that hath his quiver<S>827</S> full<S>4390</S> of them: they shall not be ashamed<S>954</S>, but they shall speak<S>1696</S> with the enemies<S>341</S> in the gate<S>8179</S>. <sup>his: Heb. filled his quiver with them</sup> <sup>speak: or, subdue, or, destroy</sup>

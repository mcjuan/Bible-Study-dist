Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Go<S>1980</S> and get<S>7069</S> a potter's<S>3335</S> earthen<S>2789</S> bottle<S>1228</S>, and take of the ancients<S>2205</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, and of the ancients<S>2205</S> of the priests<S>3548</S>;
And go forth<S>3318</S> unto the valley<S>1516</S> of the son<S>1121</S> of Hinnom<S>2011</S>, which is by the entry<S>6607</S> of the east<S>2777</S> gate<S>8179</S>, and proclaim<S>7121</S> there the words<S>1697</S> that I shall tell<S>1696</S> thee, <sup>the east: Heb. the sun gate</sup>
And say<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> ye the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, O kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Behold, I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon this place<S>4725</S>, the which whosoever heareth<S>8085</S>, his ears<S>241</S> shall tingle<S>6750</S>.
Because they have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and have estranged<S>5234</S> this place<S>4725</S>, and have burned incense<S>6999</S> in it unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, whom neither they nor their fathers<S>1</S> have known<S>3045</S>, nor the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and have filled<S>4390</S> this place<S>4725</S> with the blood<S>1818</S> of innocents<S>5355</S>;
They have built<S>1129</S> also the high places<S>1116</S> of Baal<S>1168</S>, to burn<S>8313</S> their sons<S>1121</S> with fire<S>784</S> for burnt offerings<S>5930</S> unto Baal<S>1168</S>, which I commanded<S>6680</S> not, nor spake<S>1696</S> it, neither came<S>5927</S> it into my mind<S>3820</S>:
Therefore, behold, the days<S>3117</S> come<S>935</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that this place<S>4725</S> shall no more be called<S>7121</S> Tophet<S>8612</S>, nor The valley<S>1516</S> of the son<S>1121</S> of Hinnom<S>2011</S>, but The valley<S>1516</S> of slaughter<S>2028</S>.
And I will make void<S>1238</S> the counsel<S>6098</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S> in this place<S>4725</S>; and I will cause them to fall<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S> before<S>6440</S> their enemies<S>341</S>, and by the hands<S>3027</S> of them that seek<S>1245</S> their lives<S>5315</S>: and their carcases<S>5038</S> will I give<S>5414</S> to be meat<S>3978</S> for the fowls<S>5775</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S>, and for the beasts<S>929</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
And I will make<S>7760</S> this city<S>5892</S> desolate<S>8047</S>, and an hissing<S>8322</S>; every one that passeth<S>5674</S> thereby shall be astonished<S>8074</S> and hiss<S>8319</S> because of all the plagues<S>4347</S> thereof.
And I will cause them to eat<S>398</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> of their sons<S>1121</S> and the flesh<S>1320</S> of their daughters<S>1323</S>, and they shall eat<S>398</S> every one<S>376</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> of his friend<S>7453</S> in the siege<S>4692</S> and straitness<S>4689</S>, wherewith their enemies<S>341</S>, and they that seek<S>1245</S> their lives<S>5315</S>, shall straiten<S>6693</S> them.
Then shalt thou break<S>7665</S> the bottle<S>1228</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the men<S>582</S> that go<S>1980</S> with thee,
And shalt say<S>559</S> unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; Even so<S>3602</S> will I break<S>7665</S> this people<S>5971</S> and this city<S>5892</S>, as one breaketh<S>7665</S> a potter's<S>3335</S> vessel<S>3627</S>, that cannot<S>3201</S> be made whole again<S>7495</S>: and they shall bury<S>6912</S> them in Tophet<S>8612</S>, till there be no place<S>4725</S> to bury<S>6912</S>. <sup>be made: Heb. be healed</sup>
Thus will I do<S>6213</S> unto this place<S>4725</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and to the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof, and even make<S>5414</S> this city<S>5892</S> as Tophet<S>8612</S>:
And the houses<S>1004</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and the houses<S>1004</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, shall be defiled<S>2931</S> as the place<S>4725</S> of Tophet<S>8612</S>, because of all the houses<S>1004</S> upon whose roofs<S>1406</S> they have burned incense<S>6999</S> unto all the host<S>6635</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and have poured out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>.
Then came<S>935</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from Tophet<S>8612</S>, whither the LORD<S>3068</S> had sent<S>7971</S> him to prophesy<S>5012</S>; and he stood<S>5975</S> in the court<S>2691</S> of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> house<S>1004</S>; and said<S>559</S> to all the people<S>5971</S>,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Behold, I will bring<S>935</S> upon this city<S>5892</S> and upon all her towns<S>5892</S> all the evil<S>7451</S> that I have pronounced<S>1696</S> against it, because they have hardened<S>7185</S> their necks<S>6203</S>, that they might not hear<S>8085</S> my words<S>1697</S>.

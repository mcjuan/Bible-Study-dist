The burden<S>4853</S> of the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> for Israel<S>3478</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, which stretcheth<S>5186</S> forth the heavens<S>8064</S>, and layeth the foundation<S>3245</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and formeth<S>3335</S> the spirit<S>7307</S> of man<S>120</S> within<S>7130</S> him.
Behold, I will make<S>7760</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S> a cup<S>5592</S> of trembling<S>7478</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S> round about<S>5439</S>, when they shall be in the siege<S>4692</S> both against Judah<S>3063</S> and against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>trembling: or, slumber, or, poison</sup> <sup>when: or, and also against Judah shall he be which shall be in siege against Jerusalem</sup>
And in that day<S>3117</S> will I make<S>7760</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S> a burdensome<S>4614</S> stone<S>68</S> for all people<S>5971</S>: all that burden<S>6006</S> themselves with it shall be cut in pieces<S>8295</S> <S>8295</S>, though all the people<S>1471</S> of the earth<S>776</S> be gathered together<S>622</S> against it.
In that day<S>3117</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, I will smite<S>5221</S> every horse<S>5483</S> with astonishment<S>8541</S>, and his rider<S>7392</S> with madness<S>7697</S>: and I will open<S>6491</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and will smite<S>5221</S> every horse<S>5483</S> of the people<S>5971</S> with blindness<S>5788</S>.
And the governors<S>441</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> shall say<S>559</S> in their heart<S>3820</S>, The inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> shall be my strength<S>556</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> their God<S>430</S>. <sup>The inhabitants: or, There is strength to me and to the inhabitants, etc</sup>
In that day<S>3117</S> will I make<S>7760</S> the governors<S>441</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> like an hearth<S>3595</S> of fire<S>784</S> among the wood<S>6086</S>, and like a torch<S>3940</S> of fire<S>784</S> in a sheaf<S>5995</S>; and they shall devour<S>398</S> all the people<S>5971</S> round about<S>5439</S>, on the right hand<S>3225</S> and on the left<S>8040</S>: and Jerusalem<S>3389</S> shall be inhabited<S>3427</S> again in her own place, even in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> also shall save<S>3467</S> the tents<S>168</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> first<S>7223</S>, that the glory<S>8597</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S> and the glory<S>8597</S> of the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> do not magnify<S>1431</S> themselves against Judah<S>3063</S>.
In that day<S>3117</S> shall the LORD<S>3068</S> defend<S>1598</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and he that is feeble<S>3782</S> among them at that day<S>3117</S> shall be as David<S>1732</S>; and the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S> shall be as God<S>430</S>, as the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> before<S>6440</S> them. <sup>feeble: or, abject: Heb. fallen</sup>
And it shall come to pass in that day<S>3117</S>, that I will seek<S>1245</S> to destroy<S>8045</S> all the nations<S>1471</S> that come<S>935</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And I will pour<S>8210</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and upon the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, the spirit<S>7307</S> of grace<S>2580</S> and of supplications<S>8469</S>: and they shall look<S>5027</S> upon me whom they have pierced<S>1856</S>, and they shall mourn<S>4553</S> for him, as one mourneth<S>5594</S> for his only<S>3173</S> son, and shall be in bitterness<S>4843</S> for him, as one that is in bitterness<S>4843</S> for his firstborn<S>1060</S>.
In that day<S>3117</S> shall there be a great<S>1431</S> mourning<S>4553</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, as the mourning<S>4553</S> of Hadadrimmon<S>1910</S> in the valley<S>1237</S> of Megiddon<S>4023</S>.
And the land<S>776</S> shall mourn<S>5594</S>, every<S>4940</S> family<S>4940</S> apart<S>905</S>; the family<S>4940</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S> apart, and their wives<S>802</S> apart; the family<S>4940</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Nathan<S>5416</S> apart, and their wives<S>802</S> apart; <sup>every: Heb. families, families</sup>

Maschil<S>4905</S> of Asaph<S>623</S>. Give ear<S>238</S>, O my people<S>5971</S>, to my law<S>8451</S>: incline<S>5186</S> your ears<S>241</S> to the words<S>561</S> of my mouth<S>6310</S>. <sup>Maschil: or, A Psalm for Asaph to give instruction</sup>
I will open<S>6605</S> my mouth<S>6310</S> in a parable<S>4912</S>: I will utter<S>5042</S> dark sayings<S>2420</S> of old<S>6924</S>:
Which we have heard<S>8085</S> and known<S>3045</S>, and our fathers<S>1</S> have told<S>5608</S> us.
We will not hide<S>3582</S> them from their children<S>1121</S>, shewing<S>5608</S> to the generation<S>1755</S> to come<S>314</S> the praises<S>8416</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and his strength<S>5807</S>, and his wonderful works<S>6381</S> that he hath done<S>6213</S>.
For he established<S>6965</S> a testimony<S>5715</S> in Jacob<S>3290</S>, and appointed<S>7760</S> a law<S>8451</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, which he commanded<S>6680</S> our fathers<S>1</S>, that they should make them known<S>3045</S> to their children<S>1121</S>:
That the generation<S>1755</S> to come<S>314</S> might know<S>3045</S> them, even the children<S>1121</S> which should be born<S>3205</S>; who should arise<S>6965</S> and declare<S>5608</S> them to their children<S>1121</S>:
That they might set<S>7760</S> their hope<S>3689</S> in God<S>430</S>, and not forget<S>7911</S> the works<S>4611</S> of God<S>410</S>, but keep<S>5341</S> his commandments<S>4687</S>:
And might not be as their fathers<S>1</S>, a stubborn<S>5637</S> and rebellious<S>4784</S> generation<S>1755</S>; a generation<S>1755</S> that set<S>3559</S> not their heart<S>3820</S> aright<S>3559</S>, and whose spirit<S>7307</S> was not stedfast<S>539</S> with God<S>410</S>. <sup>that: Heb. that prepared not their heart</sup>
The children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, being armed<S>5401</S>, and carrying<S>7411</S> bows<S>7198</S>, turned back<S>2015</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of battle<S>7128</S>. <sup>carrying: Heb. throwing forth</sup>
They kept<S>8104</S> not the covenant<S>1285</S> of God<S>430</S>, and refused<S>3985</S> to walk<S>3212</S> in his law<S>8451</S>;
And forgat<S>7911</S> his works<S>5949</S>, and his wonders<S>6381</S> that he had shewed<S>7200</S> them.
Marvellous things<S>6382</S> did<S>6213</S> he in the sight<S>5048</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>, in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, in the field<S>7704</S> of Zoan<S>6814</S>.
He divided<S>1234</S> the sea<S>3220</S>, and caused them to pass through<S>5674</S>; and he made the waters<S>4325</S> to stand<S>5324</S> as an heap<S>5067</S>.
In the daytime<S>3119</S> also he led<S>5148</S> them with a cloud<S>6051</S>, and all the night<S>3915</S> with a light<S>216</S> of fire<S>784</S>.
He clave<S>1234</S> the rocks<S>6697</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and gave them drink<S>8248</S> as out of the great<S>7227</S> depths<S>8415</S>.
He brought<S>3318</S> streams<S>5140</S> also out of the rock<S>5553</S>, and caused waters<S>4325</S> to run down<S>3381</S> like rivers<S>5104</S>.
And they sinned<S>2398</S> yet more<S>3254</S> against him by provoking<S>4784</S> the most High<S>5945</S> in the wilderness<S>6723</S>.
And they tempted<S>5254</S> God<S>410</S> in their heart<S>3824</S> by asking<S>7592</S> meat<S>400</S> for their lust<S>5315</S>.
Yea, they spake<S>1696</S> against God<S>430</S>; they said<S>559</S>, Can<S>3201</S> God<S>410</S> furnish<S>6186</S> a table<S>7979</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>? <sup>furnish: Heb. order</sup>
Behold, he smote<S>5221</S> the rock<S>6697</S>, that the waters<S>4325</S> gushed out<S>2100</S>, and the streams<S>5158</S> overflowed<S>7857</S>; can<S>3201</S> he give<S>5414</S> bread<S>3899</S> also? can<S>3201</S> he provide<S>3559</S> flesh<S>7607</S> for his people<S>5971</S>?
Therefore the LORD<S>3068</S> heard<S>8085</S> this, and was wroth<S>5674</S>: so a fire<S>784</S> was kindled<S>5400</S> against Jacob<S>3290</S>, and anger<S>639</S> also came up<S>5927</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>;
Because they believed<S>539</S> not in God<S>430</S>, and trusted<S>982</S> not in his salvation<S>3444</S>:
Though he had commanded<S>6680</S> the clouds<S>7834</S> from above<S>4605</S>, and opened<S>6605</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>,
And had rained down<S>4305</S> manna<S>4478</S> upon them to eat<S>398</S>, and had given<S>5414</S> them of the corn<S>1715</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>.
Man<S>376</S> did eat<S>398</S> angels'<S>47</S> food<S>3899</S>: he sent<S>7971</S> them meat<S>6720</S> to the full<S>7648</S>. <sup>Man: or, Every one did eat the bread of the mighty</sup>
He caused an east wind<S>6921</S> to blow<S>5265</S> in the heaven<S>8064</S>: and by his power<S>5797</S> he brought in<S>5090</S> the south wind<S>8486</S>. <sup>to blow: Heb. to go</sup>
He rained<S>4305</S> flesh<S>7607</S> also upon them as dust<S>6083</S>, and feathered<S>3671</S> fowls<S>5775</S> like as the sand<S>2344</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>: <sup>feathered: Heb. fowl of wing</sup>
And he let it fall<S>5307</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of their camp<S>4264</S>, round about<S>5439</S> their habitations<S>4908</S>.
So they did eat<S>398</S>, and were well<S>3966</S> filled<S>7646</S>: for he gave<S>935</S> them their own desire<S>8378</S>;
They were not estranged<S>2114</S> from their lust<S>8378</S>. But while their meat<S>400</S> was yet in their mouths<S>6310</S>,
The wrath<S>639</S> of God<S>430</S> came<S>5927</S> upon them, and slew<S>2026</S> the fattest<S>4924</S> of them, and smote down<S>3766</S> the chosen<S>970</S> men of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>smote: Heb. made to bow</sup> <sup>Chosen: or, young men</sup>
For all this they sinned<S>2398</S> still, and believed<S>539</S> not for his wondrous works<S>6381</S>.
Therefore their days<S>3117</S> did he consume<S>3615</S> in vanity<S>1892</S>, and their years<S>8141</S> in trouble<S>928</S>.
When he slew<S>2026</S> them, then they sought<S>1875</S> him: and they returned<S>7725</S> and enquired early<S>7836</S> after God<S>410</S>.
And they remembered<S>2142</S> that God<S>430</S> was their rock<S>6697</S>, and the high<S>5945</S> God<S>410</S> their redeemer<S>1350</S>.
Nevertheless they did flatter<S>6601</S> him with their mouth<S>6310</S>, and they lied<S>3576</S> unto him with their tongues<S>3956</S>.
For their heart<S>3820</S> was not right<S>3559</S> with him, neither were they stedfast<S>539</S> in his covenant<S>1285</S>.
But he, being full of compassion<S>7349</S>, forgave<S>3722</S> their iniquity<S>5771</S>, and destroyed<S>7843</S> them not: yea, many a time<S>7235</S> turned<S>7725</S> he his anger<S>639</S> away<S>7725</S>, and did not stir up<S>5782</S> all his wrath<S>2534</S>.
For he remembered<S>2142</S> that they were but flesh<S>1320</S>; a wind<S>7307</S> that passeth away<S>1980</S>, and cometh not again<S>7725</S>.
How<S>4100</S> oft did they provoke<S>4784</S> him in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and grieve<S>6087</S> him in the desert<S>3452</S>! <sup>provoke: or, rebel against</sup>
Yea, they turned back<S>7725</S> and tempted<S>5254</S> God<S>410</S>, and limited<S>8428</S> the Holy One<S>6918</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
They remembered<S>2142</S> not his hand<S>3027</S>, nor the day<S>3117</S> when he delivered<S>6299</S> them from the enemy<S>6862</S>. <sup>from: or, from affliction</sup>
How he had wrought<S>7760</S> his signs<S>226</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and his wonders<S>4159</S> in the field<S>7704</S> of Zoan<S>6814</S>: <sup>wrought: Heb. set</sup>
And had turned<S>2015</S> their rivers<S>2975</S> into blood<S>1818</S>; and their floods<S>5140</S>, that they could not drink<S>8354</S>.
He sent<S>7971</S> divers sorts of flies<S>6157</S> among them, which devoured<S>398</S> them; and frogs<S>6854</S>, which destroyed<S>7843</S> them.
He gave<S>5414</S> also their increase<S>2981</S> unto the caterpiller<S>2625</S>, and their labour<S>3018</S> unto the locust<S>697</S>.
He destroyed<S>2026</S> their vines<S>1612</S> with hail<S>1259</S>, and their sycomore trees<S>8256</S> with frost<S>2602</S>. <sup>destroyed: Heb. killed</sup> <sup>frost: or, great hailstones</sup>
He gave up<S>5462</S> their cattle<S>1165</S> also to the hail<S>1259</S>, and their flocks<S>4735</S> to hot thunderbolts<S>7565</S>. <sup>gave: Heb. shut up</sup> <sup>hot: or, lightnings</sup>
He cast<S>7971</S> upon them the fierceness<S>2740</S> of his anger<S>639</S>, wrath<S>5678</S>, and indignation<S>2195</S>, and trouble<S>6869</S>, by sending<S>4917</S> evil<S>7451</S> angels<S>4397</S> among them.
He made<S>6424</S> a way<S>5410</S> to his anger<S>639</S>; he spared<S>2820</S> not their soul<S>5315</S> from death<S>4194</S>, but gave<S>5462</S> their life<S>2416</S> over<S>5462</S> to the pestilence<S>1698</S>; <sup>He made: Heb. He weighed a path</sup> <sup>life: or, beasts to the murrain</sup>
And smote<S>5221</S> all the firstborn<S>1060</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>; the chief<S>7225</S> of their strength<S>202</S> in the tabernacles<S>168</S> of Ham<S>2526</S>:
But made his own people<S>5971</S> to go forth<S>5265</S> like sheep<S>6629</S>, and guided<S>5090</S> them in the wilderness<S>4057</S> like a flock<S>5739</S>.
And he led<S>5148</S> them on safely<S>983</S>, so that they feared<S>6342</S> not: but the sea<S>3220</S> overwhelmed<S>3680</S> their enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>overwhelmed: Heb. covered</sup>
And he brought<S>935</S> them to the border<S>1366</S> of his sanctuary<S>6944</S>, even to this mountain<S>2022</S>, which his right hand<S>3225</S> had purchased<S>7069</S>.
He cast out<S>1644</S> the heathen<S>1471</S> also before<S>6440</S> them, and divided<S>5307</S> them an inheritance<S>5159</S> by line<S>2256</S>, and made the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to dwell<S>7931</S> in their tents<S>168</S>.
Yet they tempted<S>5254</S> and provoked<S>4784</S> the most high<S>5945</S> God<S>430</S>, and kept<S>8104</S> not his testimonies<S>5713</S>:
But turned back<S>5472</S>, and dealt unfaithfully<S>898</S> like their fathers<S>1</S>: they were turned aside<S>2015</S> like a deceitful<S>7423</S> bow<S>7198</S>.
For they provoked him to anger<S>3707</S> with their high places<S>1116</S>, and moved him to jealousy<S>7065</S> with their graven images<S>6456</S>.
When God<S>430</S> heard<S>8085</S> this, he was wroth<S>5674</S>, and greatly<S>3966</S> abhorred<S>3988</S> Israel<S>3478</S>:
So that he forsook<S>5203</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of Shiloh<S>7887</S>, the tent<S>168</S> which he placed<S>7931</S> among men<S>120</S>;
And delivered<S>5414</S> his strength<S>5797</S> into captivity<S>7628</S>, and his glory<S>8597</S> into the enemy's<S>6862</S> hand<S>3027</S>.
He gave<S>5462</S> his people<S>5971</S> over<S>5462</S> also unto the sword<S>2719</S>; and was wroth<S>5674</S> with his inheritance<S>5159</S>.
The fire<S>784</S> consumed<S>398</S> their young men<S>970</S>; and their maidens<S>1330</S> were not given to marriage<S>1984</S>. <sup>given: Heb. praised</sup>
Their priests<S>3548</S> fell<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>; and their widows<S>490</S> made no lamentation<S>1058</S>.
Then the Lord<S>136</S> awaked<S>3364</S> as one out of sleep<S>3463</S>, and like a mighty man<S>1368</S> that shouteth<S>7442</S> by reason of wine<S>3196</S>.
And he smote<S>5221</S> his enemies<S>6862</S> in the hinder parts<S>268</S>: he put<S>5414</S> them to a perpetual<S>5769</S> reproach<S>2781</S>.
Moreover he refused<S>3988</S> the tabernacle<S>168</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, and chose<S>977</S> not the tribe<S>7626</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>:
But chose<S>977</S> the tribe<S>7626</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, the mount<S>2022</S> Zion<S>6726</S> which he loved<S>157</S>.
And he built<S>1129</S> his sanctuary<S>4720</S> like high<S>7311</S> palaces, like the earth<S>776</S> which he hath established<S>3245</S> for ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>established: Heb. founded</sup>
He chose<S>977</S> David<S>1732</S> also his servant<S>5650</S>, and took<S>3947</S> him from the sheepfolds<S>4356</S> <S>6629</S>:
From following<S>310</S> the ewes great with young<S>5763</S> he brought<S>935</S> him to feed<S>7462</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> his people<S>5971</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> his inheritance<S>5159</S>. <sup>following: Heb. after</sup>
So he fed<S>7462</S> them according to the integrity<S>8537</S> of his heart<S>3824</S>; and guided<S>5148</S> them by the skilfulness<S>8394</S> of his hands<S>3709</S>.

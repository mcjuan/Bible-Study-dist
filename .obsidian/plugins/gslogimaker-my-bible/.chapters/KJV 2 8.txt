And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Go<S>935</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me.
And if thou refuse<S>3986</S> to let them go<S>7971</S>, behold, I will smite<S>5062</S> all thy borders<S>1366</S> with frogs<S>6854</S>:
And the river<S>2975</S> shall bring forth<S>8317</S> frogs<S>6854</S> abundantly<S>8317</S>, which shall go up<S>5927</S> and come<S>935</S> into thine house<S>1004</S>, and into thy bedchamber<S>2315</S> <S>4904</S>, and upon thy bed<S>4296</S>, and into the house<S>1004</S> of thy servants<S>5650</S>, and upon thy people<S>5971</S>, and into thine ovens<S>8574</S>, and into thy kneadingtroughs<S>4863</S>: <sup>kneadingtroughs: or, dough</sup>
And the frogs<S>6854</S> shall come up<S>5927</S> both on thee, and upon thy people<S>5971</S>, and upon all thy servants<S>5650</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Say<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Stretch forth<S>5186</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> with thy rod<S>4294</S> over the streams<S>5104</S>, over the rivers<S>2975</S>, and over the ponds<S>98</S>, and cause frogs<S>6854</S> to come up<S>5927</S> upon the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Aaron<S>175</S> stretched out<S>5186</S> his hand<S>3027</S> over the waters<S>4325</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; and the frogs<S>6854</S> came up<S>5927</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And the magicians<S>2748</S> did<S>6213</S> so with their enchantments<S>3909</S>, and brought up<S>5927</S> frogs<S>6854</S> upon the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Then Pharaoh<S>6547</S> called<S>7121</S> for Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Intreat<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that he may take away<S>5493</S> the frogs<S>6854</S> from me, and from my people<S>5971</S>; and I will let the people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may do sacrifice<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, Glory<S>6286</S> over me: when<S>4970</S> shall I intreat<S>6279</S> for thee, and for thy servants<S>5650</S>, and for thy people<S>5971</S>, to destroy<S>3772</S> the frogs<S>6854</S> from thee and thy houses<S>1004</S>, that they may remain<S>7604</S> in the river<S>2975</S> only? <sup>Glory: or, Have this honour over me, etc</sup> <sup>when: or, against when</sup> <sup>to destroy: Heb. to cut off</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, To morrow<S>4279</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, Be it according to thy word<S>1697</S>: that thou mayest know<S>3045</S> that there is none like unto the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>. <sup>To morrow: or, Against to morrow</sup>
And the frogs<S>6854</S> shall depart<S>5493</S> from thee, and from thy houses<S>1004</S>, and from thy servants<S>5650</S>, and from thy people<S>5971</S>; they shall remain<S>7604</S> in the river<S>2975</S> only.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> went out<S>3318</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> because of<S>1697</S> the frogs<S>6854</S> which he had brought<S>7760</S> against Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> did<S>6213</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>; and the frogs<S>6854</S> died<S>4191</S> out of the houses<S>1004</S>, out of the villages<S>2691</S>, and out of the fields<S>7704</S>.
And they gathered them together<S>6651</S> upon heaps<S>2563</S>: and the land<S>776</S> stank<S>887</S>.
But when Pharaoh<S>6547</S> saw<S>7200</S> that there was respite<S>7309</S>, he hardened<S>3513</S> his heart<S>3820</S>, and hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had said<S>1696</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Say<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Stretch out<S>5186</S> thy rod<S>4294</S>, and smite<S>5221</S> the dust<S>6083</S> of the land<S>776</S>, that it may become lice<S>3654</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And they did<S>6213</S> so; for Aaron<S>175</S> stretched out<S>5186</S> his hand<S>3027</S> with his rod<S>4294</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> the dust<S>6083</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and it became lice<S>3654</S> in man<S>120</S>, and in beast<S>929</S>; all the dust<S>6083</S> of the land<S>776</S> became lice<S>3654</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And the magicians<S>2748</S> did<S>6213</S> so with their enchantments<S>3909</S> to bring forth<S>3318</S> lice<S>3654</S>, but they could<S>3201</S> not: so there were lice<S>3654</S> upon man<S>120</S>, and upon beast<S>929</S>.
Then the magicians<S>2748</S> said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, This is the finger<S>676</S> of God<S>430</S>: and Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S> was hardened<S>2388</S>, and he hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had said<S>1696</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Rise up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and stand<S>3320</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>; lo, he cometh forth<S>3318</S> to the water<S>4325</S>; and say<S>559</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me.
Else, if thou wilt not let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, behold, I will send<S>7971</S> swarms<S>6157</S> of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants<S>5650</S>, and upon thy people<S>5971</S>, and into thy houses<S>1004</S>: and the houses<S>1004</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S> shall be full<S>4390</S> of swarms<S>6157</S> of flies, and also the ground<S>127</S> whereon they are. <sup>swarms: or, a mixture of noisome beasts, etc</sup>
And I will sever<S>6395</S> in that day<S>3117</S> the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>, in which my people<S>5971</S> dwell<S>5975</S>, that no<S>1115</S> swarms<S>6157</S> of flies shall be<S>1961</S> there; to the end<S>4616</S> thou mayest know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
And I will put<S>7760</S> a division<S>6304</S> between my people<S>5971</S> and thy people<S>5971</S>: to morrow<S>4279</S> shall this sign<S>226</S> be. <sup>a division: Heb. a redemption</sup> <sup>to morrow: or, by to morrow</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> did<S>6213</S> so; and there came<S>935</S> a grievous<S>3515</S> swarm<S>6157</S> of flies into the house<S>1004</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and into his servants'<S>5650</S> houses<S>1004</S>, and into all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>: the land<S>776</S> was corrupted<S>7843</S> by reason<S>6440</S> of the swarm<S>6157</S> of flies. <sup>corrupted: or, destroyed</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> called<S>7121</S> for<S>413</S> Moses<S>4872</S> and for Aaron<S>175</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S> ye, sacrifice<S>2076</S> to your God<S>430</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, It is not meet<S>3559</S> so to do<S>6213</S>; for<S>2005</S> we shall sacrifice<S>2076</S> the abomination<S>8441</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>: lo, shall we sacrifice<S>2076</S> the abomination<S>8441</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>, and will they not stone<S>5619</S> us?
We will go<S>3212</S> three<S>7969</S> days'<S>3117</S> journey<S>1870</S> into the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and sacrifice<S>2076</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, as he shall command<S>559</S> us.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S>, I will let you go<S>7971</S>, that ye may sacrifice<S>2076</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>; only ye shall not go<S>3212</S> very<S>7368</S> far away<S>7368</S>: intreat<S>6279</S> for me<S>1157</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Behold, I go out<S>3318</S> from thee, and I will intreat<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> that the swarms<S>6157</S> of flies may depart<S>5493</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, from his servants<S>5650</S>, and from his people<S>5971</S>, to morrow<S>4279</S>: but<S>7535</S> let not Pharaoh<S>6547</S> deal deceitfully<S>2048</S> any more<S>3254</S> in not<S>1115</S> letting the people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S> to sacrifice<S>2076</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> went out<S>3318</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and intreated<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> did<S>6213</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>; and he removed<S>5493</S> the swarms<S>6157</S> of flies from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, from his servants<S>5650</S>, and from his people<S>5971</S>; there remained<S>7604</S> not one<S>259</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> hardened<S>3513</S> his heart<S>3820</S> at this time<S>6471</S> also, neither would he let the people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>.

Amaziah<S>558</S> was twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and nine<S>8672</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Jehoaddan<S>3086</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, but not with a perfect<S>8003</S> heart<S>3824</S>.
Now it came to pass, when the kingdom<S>4467</S> was established<S>2388</S> to him, that he slew<S>2026</S> his servants<S>5650</S> that had killed<S>5221</S> the king<S>4428</S> his father<S>1</S>. <sup>established: Heb. confirmed upon him</sup>
But he slew<S>4191</S> not their children<S>1121</S>, but did as it is written<S>3789</S> in the law<S>8451</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>, where the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The fathers<S>1</S> shall not die<S>4191</S> for the children<S>1121</S>, neither shall the children<S>1121</S> die<S>4191</S> for the fathers<S>1</S>, but every man<S>376</S> shall die<S>4191</S> for his own sin<S>2399</S>.
Moreover Amaziah<S>558</S> gathered<S>6908</S> Judah<S>3063</S> together<S>6908</S>, and made<S>5975</S> them captains<S>8269</S> over thousands<S>505</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over hundreds<S>3967</S>, according to the houses<S>1004</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>, throughout all Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>: and he numbered<S>6485</S> them from twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> and above<S>4605</S>, and found<S>4672</S> them three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> choice<S>977</S> men, able to go forth<S>3318</S> to war<S>6635</S>, that could handle<S>270</S> spear<S>7420</S> and shield<S>6793</S>.
He hired<S>7936</S> also an hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> mighty<S>1368</S> men of valour<S>2428</S> out of Israel<S>3478</S> for an hundred<S>3967</S> talents<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S>.
But there came<S>935</S> a man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> to him, saying<S>559</S>, O king<S>4428</S>, let not the army<S>6635</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> go<S>935</S> with thee; for the LORD<S>3068</S> is not with Israel<S>3478</S>, to wit, with all the children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>.
But if thou wilt go<S>935</S>, do<S>6213</S> it, be strong<S>2388</S> for the battle<S>4421</S>: God<S>430</S> shall make thee fall<S>3782</S> before<S>6440</S> the enemy<S>341</S>: for God<S>430</S> hath<S>3426</S> power<S>3581</S> to help<S>5826</S>, and to cast down<S>3782</S>.
And Amaziah<S>558</S> said<S>559</S> to the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, But what shall we do<S>6213</S> for the hundred<S>3967</S> talents<S>3603</S> which I have given<S>5414</S> to the army<S>1416</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>? And the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> answered<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> is<S>3426</S> able to give<S>5414</S> thee much more<S>7235</S> than this. <sup>army: Heb. band</sup>
Then Amaziah<S>558</S> separated<S>914</S> them, to wit, the army<S>1416</S> that was come<S>935</S> to him out of Ephraim<S>669</S>, to go<S>3212</S> home<S>4725</S> again<S>3212</S>: wherefore their anger<S>639</S> was greatly<S>3966</S> kindled<S>2734</S> against Judah<S>3063</S>, and they returned<S>7725</S> home<S>4725</S> in great<S>2750</S> anger<S>639</S>. <sup>home again: Heb. to their place</sup> <sup>in great: Heb. in heat of anger</sup>
And Amaziah<S>558</S> strengthened<S>2388</S> himself, and led forth<S>5090</S> his people<S>5971</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to the valley<S>1516</S> of salt<S>4417</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Seir<S>8165</S> ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S>.
And other ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> left alive<S>2416</S> did the children<S>1121</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> carry away captive<S>7617</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them unto the top<S>7218</S> of the rock<S>5553</S>, and cast them down<S>7993</S> from the top<S>7218</S> of the rock<S>5553</S>, that they all were broken in pieces<S>1234</S>.
But the soldiers<S>1121</S> of the army<S>1416</S> which Amaziah<S>558</S> sent back<S>7725</S>, that they should not go<S>3212</S> with him to battle<S>4421</S>, fell<S>6584</S> upon the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, from Samaria<S>8111</S> even unto Bethhoron<S>1032</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> three<S>7969</S> thousand<S>505</S> of them, and took<S>962</S> much<S>7227</S> spoil<S>961</S>. <sup>the soldiers: Heb. the sons of the band</sup>
Now it came to pass, after<S>310</S> that Amaziah<S>558</S> was come<S>935</S> from the slaughter<S>5221</S> of the Edomites<S>130</S>, that he brought<S>935</S> the gods<S>430</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Seir<S>8165</S>, and set them up<S>5975</S> to be his gods<S>430</S>, and bowed down<S>7812</S> himself before<S>6440</S> them, and burned incense<S>6999</S> unto them.
Wherefore the anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was kindled<S>2734</S> against Amaziah<S>558</S>, and he sent<S>7971</S> unto him a prophet<S>5030</S>, which said<S>559</S> unto him, Why hast thou sought<S>1875</S> after the gods<S>430</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, which could not deliver<S>5337</S> their own people<S>5971</S> out of thine hand<S>3027</S>?
And it came to pass, as he talked<S>1696</S> with him, that the king said<S>559</S> unto him, Art thou made<S>5414</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> counsel<S>3289</S>? forbear<S>2308</S>; why shouldest thou be smitten<S>5221</S>? Then the prophet<S>5030</S> forbare<S>2308</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that God<S>430</S> hath determined<S>3289</S> to destroy<S>7843</S> thee, because thou hast done<S>6213</S> this, and hast not hearkened<S>8085</S> unto my counsel<S>6098</S>. <sup>determined: Heb. counselled</sup>
Then Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> took advice<S>3289</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> to Joash<S>3101</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jehu<S>3058</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Come<S>3212</S>, let us see one another<S>7200</S> in the face<S>6440</S>.
And Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> sent<S>7971</S> to Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The thistle<S>2336</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S> sent<S>7971</S> to the cedar<S>730</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> thy daughter<S>1323</S> to my son<S>1121</S> to wife<S>802</S>: and there passed by<S>5674</S> a wild<S>7704</S> beast<S>2416</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S>, and trode down<S>7429</S> the thistle<S>2336</S>. <sup>thistle: or, furze bush, or, thorn</sup> <sup>a wild: Heb. a beast of the field</sup>
Thou sayest<S>559</S>, Lo, thou hast smitten<S>5221</S> the Edomites<S>123</S>; and thine heart<S>3820</S> lifteth thee up<S>5375</S> to boast<S>3513</S>: abide<S>3427</S> now at home<S>1004</S>; why shouldest thou meddle<S>1624</S> to thine hurt<S>7451</S>, that thou shouldest fall<S>5307</S>, even thou, and Judah<S>3063</S> with thee?
But Amaziah<S>558</S> would not hear<S>8085</S>; for it came of God<S>430</S>, that he might deliver<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies, because they sought<S>1875</S> after the gods<S>430</S> of Edom<S>123</S>.
So Joash<S>3101</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went up<S>5927</S>; and they saw one another<S>7200</S> in the face<S>6440</S>, both he and Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, at Bethshemesh<S>1053</S>, which belongeth to Judah<S>3063</S>.
And Judah<S>3063</S> was put to the worse<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and they fled<S>5127</S> every man<S>376</S> to his tent<S>168</S>. <sup>put: Heb. smitten</sup>
And Joash<S>3101</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> took<S>8610</S> Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S>, at Bethshemesh<S>1053</S>, and brought<S>935</S> him to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and brake down<S>6555</S> the wall<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> from the gate<S>8179</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> to the corner<S>6437</S> gate<S>8179</S>, four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> cubits<S>520</S>. <sup>the corner: Heb. the gate of it that looketh</sup>
And he took all the gold<S>2091</S> and the silver<S>3701</S>, and all the vessels<S>3627</S> that were found<S>4672</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> with Obededom<S>5654</S>, and the treasures<S>214</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, the hostages<S>1121</S> <S>8594</S> also, and returned<S>7725</S> to Samaria<S>8111</S>.
And Amaziah<S>558</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> lived<S>2421</S> after<S>310</S> the death<S>4194</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> fifteen<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Amaziah<S>558</S>, first<S>7223</S> and last<S>314</S>, behold, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Israel<S>3478</S>?
Now after the time<S>6256</S> that Amaziah<S>558</S> did turn away<S>5493</S> from following<S>310</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> they made<S>7194</S> a conspiracy<S>7195</S> against him in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and he fled<S>5127</S> to Lachish<S>3923</S>: but they sent<S>7971</S> to Lachish<S>3923</S> after<S>310</S> him, and slew<S>4191</S> him there. <sup>from: Heb. from after</sup> <sup>made: Heb. conspired a conspiracy</sup>
And they brought<S>5375</S> him upon horses<S>5483</S>, and buried<S>6912</S> him with his fathers<S>1</S> in the city<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>. <sup>Judah: that is, the city of David</sup>

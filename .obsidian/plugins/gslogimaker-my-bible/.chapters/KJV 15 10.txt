Now when Ezra<S>5830</S> had prayed<S>6419</S>, and when he had confessed<S>3034</S>, weeping<S>1058</S> and casting himself down<S>5307</S> before<S>6440</S> the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, there assembled<S>6908</S> unto him out of Israel<S>3478</S> a very<S>3966</S> great<S>7227</S> congregation<S>6951</S> of men<S>582</S> and women<S>802</S> and children<S>3206</S>: for the people<S>5971</S> wept<S>1058</S> very<S>7235</S> sore<S>1059</S>. <sup>wept: Heb. wept a great weeping</sup>
And Shechaniah<S>7935</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehiel<S>3171</S>, one of the sons<S>1121</S> of Elam<S>5867</S>, answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto Ezra<S>5830</S>, We have trespassed<S>4603</S> against our God<S>430</S>, and have taken<S>3427</S> strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>: yet now there is<S>3426</S> hope<S>4723</S> in Israel<S>3478</S> concerning this thing.
Now therefore let us make<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with our God<S>430</S> to put away<S>3318</S> all the wives<S>802</S>, and such as are born<S>3205</S> of them, according to the counsel<S>6098</S> of my lord<S>136</S>, and of those that tremble<S>2730</S> at the commandment<S>4687</S> of our God<S>430</S>; and let it be done<S>6213</S> according to the law<S>8451</S>. <sup>to put: Heb. to bring forth</sup>
Arise<S>6965</S>; for this matter<S>1697</S> belongeth unto thee: we also will be with thee: be of good courage<S>2388</S>, and do<S>6213</S> it.
Then arose<S>6965</S> Ezra<S>5830</S>, and made the chief<S>8269</S> priests<S>3548</S>, the Levites<S>3881</S>, and all Israel<S>3478</S>, to swear<S>7650</S> that they should do<S>6213</S> according to this word<S>1697</S>. And they sware<S>7650</S>.
Then Ezra<S>5830</S> rose up<S>6965</S> from before<S>6440</S> the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, and went<S>3212</S> into the chamber<S>3957</S> of Johanan<S>3076</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Eliashib<S>475</S>: and when he came<S>3212</S> thither, he did eat<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S>, nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>: for he mourned<S>56</S> because of the transgression<S>4604</S> of them that had been carried away<S>1473</S>.
And they made proclamation<S>5674</S> <S>6963</S> throughout Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S> unto all the children<S>1121</S> of the captivity<S>1473</S>, that they should gather themselves together<S>6908</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>;
And that whosoever would not come<S>935</S> within three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>, according to the counsel<S>6098</S> of the princes<S>8269</S> and the elders<S>2205</S>, all his substance<S>7399</S> should be forfeited<S>2763</S>, and himself separated<S>914</S> from the congregation<S>6951</S> of those that had been carried away<S>1473</S>. <sup>forfeited: Heb. devoted</sup>
Then all the men<S>582</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S> gathered themselves together<S>6908</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S> within three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>. It was the ninth<S>8671</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the twentieth<S>6242</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>; and all the people<S>5971</S> sat<S>3427</S> in the street<S>7339</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, trembling<S>7460</S> because of this matter<S>1697</S>, and for the great rain<S>1653</S>. <sup>the great: Heb. the showers</sup>
And Ezra<S>5830</S> the priest<S>3548</S> stood up<S>6965</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Ye have transgressed<S>4603</S>, and have taken<S>3427</S> strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S>, to increase<S>3254</S> the trespass<S>819</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>have taken: Heb. have caused to dwell, or, have brought back</sup>
Now therefore make<S>5414</S> confession<S>8426</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of your fathers<S>1</S>, and do<S>6213</S> his pleasure<S>7522</S>: and separate<S>914</S> yourselves from the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, and from the strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S>.
Then all the congregation<S>6951</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>, As thou hast said<S>1697</S>, so must we do<S>6213</S>.
But<S>61</S> the people<S>5971</S> are many<S>7227</S>, and it is a time<S>6256</S> of much rain<S>1653</S>, and we are not able<S>3581</S> to stand<S>5975</S> without<S>2351</S>, neither is this a work<S>4399</S> of one<S>259</S> day<S>3117</S> or two<S>8147</S>: for we are many<S>7235</S> that have transgressed<S>6586</S> in this thing<S>1697</S>. <sup>we are many: or, we have greatly offended in this thing</sup>
Let now our rulers<S>8269</S> of all the congregation<S>6951</S> stand<S>5975</S>, and let all them which have taken<S>3427</S> strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S> in our cities<S>5892</S> come<S>935</S> at appointed<S>2163</S> times<S>6256</S>, and with them the elders<S>2205</S> of every city<S>5892</S>, and the judges<S>8199</S> thereof, until the fierce<S>2740</S> wrath<S>639</S> of our God<S>430</S> for this matter<S>1697</S> be turned<S>7725</S> from us. <sup>for this: or, till this matter be dispatched</sup>

And the children<S>1121</S> of the captivity<S>1473</S> did so<S>6213</S>.

And they made an end<S>3615</S> with all the men<S>582</S> that had taken<S>3427</S> strange<S>5237</S> wives<S>802</S> by the first<S>259</S> day<S>3117</S> of the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S>.

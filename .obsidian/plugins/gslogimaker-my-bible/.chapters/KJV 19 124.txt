A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S> of David<S>1732</S>. If<S>3884</S> it had not been the LORD<S>3068</S> who was on our side, now may Israel<S>3478</S> say<S>559</S>;
If<S>3884</S> it had not been the LORD<S>3068</S> who was on our side, when men<S>120</S> rose up<S>6965</S> against us:
Then<S>233</S> they had swallowed us up<S>1104</S> quick<S>2416</S>, when their wrath<S>639</S> was kindled<S>2734</S> against us:
Then<S>233</S> the waters<S>4325</S> had overwhelmed<S>7857</S> us, the stream<S>5158</S> had gone over<S>5674</S> our soul<S>5315</S>:
Then<S>233</S> the proud<S>2121</S> waters<S>4325</S> had gone over<S>5674</S> our soul<S>5315</S>.
Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S>, who hath not given<S>5414</S> us as a prey<S>2964</S> to their teeth<S>8127</S>.
Our soul<S>5315</S> is escaped<S>4422</S> as a bird<S>6833</S> out of the snare<S>6341</S> of the fowlers<S>3369</S>: the snare<S>6341</S> is broken<S>7665</S>, and we are escaped<S>4422</S>.
Our help<S>5828</S> is in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, who made<S>6213</S> heaven<S>8064</S> and earth<S>776</S>.

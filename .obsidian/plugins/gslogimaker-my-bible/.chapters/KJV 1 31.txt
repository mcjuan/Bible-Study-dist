And he heard<S>8085</S> the words<S>1697</S> of Laban's<S>3837</S> sons<S>1121</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Jacob<S>3290</S> hath taken away<S>3947</S> all that was our father's<S>1</S>; and of that which was our father's<S>1</S> hath he gotten<S>6213</S> all this glory<S>3519</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> beheld<S>7200</S> the countenance<S>6440</S> of Laban<S>3837</S>, and, behold, it was not toward him as<S>8543</S> before<S>8032</S>. <sup>as before: Heb. as yesterday and the day before</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>, Return<S>7725</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of thy fathers<S>1</S>, and to thy kindred<S>4138</S>; and I will be with thee.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> Rachel<S>7354</S> and Leah<S>3812</S> to the field<S>7704</S> unto his flock<S>6629</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto them, I see<S>7200</S> your father's<S>1</S> countenance<S>6440</S>, that it is not toward me as<S>8543</S> before<S>8032</S>; but the God<S>430</S> of my father<S>1</S> hath been<S>1961</S> with me.
And ye<S>859</S> know<S>3045</S> that with all my power<S>3581</S> I have served<S>5647</S> your father<S>1</S>.
And your father<S>1</S> hath deceived<S>2048</S> me, and changed<S>2498</S> my wages<S>4909</S> ten<S>6235</S> times<S>4489</S>; but God<S>430</S> suffered him<S>5414</S> not to hurt<S>7489</S> me<S>5978</S>.
If he said<S>559</S> thus, The speckled<S>5348</S> shall be thy wages<S>7939</S>; then all the cattle<S>6629</S> bare<S>3205</S> speckled<S>5348</S>: and if he said<S>559</S> thus, The ringstraked<S>6124</S> shall be thy hire<S>7939</S>; then bare<S>3205</S> all the cattle<S>6629</S> ringstraked<S>6124</S>.
Thus God<S>430</S> hath taken away<S>5337</S> the cattle<S>4735</S> of your father<S>1</S>, and given<S>5414</S> them to me.
And it came to pass at the time<S>6256</S> that the cattle<S>6629</S> conceived<S>3179</S>, that I lifted up<S>5375</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> in a dream<S>2472</S>, and, behold, the rams<S>6260</S> which leaped<S>5927</S> upon the cattle<S>6629</S> were ringstraked<S>6124</S>, speckled<S>5348</S>, and grisled<S>1261</S>. <sup>rams: or, he goats</sup>
And the angel<S>4397</S> of God<S>430</S> spake<S>559</S> unto me in a dream<S>2472</S>, saying, Jacob<S>3290</S>: And I said<S>559</S>, Here am I.
And he said<S>559</S>, Lift up<S>5375</S> now thine eyes<S>5869</S>, and see<S>7200</S>, all the rams<S>6260</S> which leap<S>5927</S> upon the cattle<S>6629</S> are ringstraked<S>6124</S>, speckled<S>5348</S>, and grisled<S>1261</S>: for I have seen<S>7200</S> all that Laban<S>3837</S> doeth<S>6213</S> unto thee.
I am the God<S>410</S> of Bethel<S>1008</S>, where thou anointedst<S>4886</S> the pillar<S>4676</S>, and where thou vowedst<S>5087</S> a vow<S>5088</S> unto me: now arise<S>6965</S>, get thee out<S>3318</S> from this land<S>776</S>, and return<S>7725</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of thy kindred<S>4138</S>.
And Rachel<S>7354</S> and Leah<S>3812</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto him, Is there yet any portion<S>2506</S> or inheritance<S>5159</S> for us in our father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>?
Are we not counted<S>2803</S> of him strangers<S>5237</S>? for he hath sold<S>4376</S> us, and hath quite<S>398</S> devoured<S>398</S> also our money<S>3701</S>.
For all the riches<S>6239</S> which God<S>430</S> hath taken<S>5337</S> from our father<S>1</S>, that is ours, and our children's<S>1121</S>: now then, whatsoever God<S>430</S> hath said<S>559</S> unto thee, do<S>6213</S>.
Then Jacob<S>3290</S> rose up<S>6965</S>, and set<S>5375</S> his sons<S>1121</S> and his wives<S>802</S> upon camels<S>1581</S>;
And he carried away<S>5090</S> all his cattle<S>4735</S>, and all his goods<S>7399</S> which he had gotten<S>7408</S>, the cattle<S>4735</S> of his getting<S>7075</S>, which he had gotten<S>7408</S> in Padanaram<S>6307</S>, for to go<S>935</S> to Isaac<S>3327</S> his father<S>1</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>.
And Laban<S>3837</S> went<S>1980</S> to shear<S>1494</S> his sheep<S>6629</S>: and Rachel<S>7354</S> had stolen<S>1589</S> the images<S>8655</S> that were her father's<S>1</S>. <sup>images: Heb. teraphim</sup>
And Jacob<S>3290</S> stole away<S>1589</S> unawares<S>3820</S> to Laban<S>3837</S> the Syrian<S>761</S>, in that<S>5921</S> he told<S>5046</S> him not<S>1097</S> that he fled<S>1272</S>. <sup>unawares: Heb. the heart of Laban</sup>
So he fled<S>1272</S> with all that he had; and he rose up<S>6965</S>, and passed over<S>5674</S> the river<S>5104</S>, and set<S>7760</S> his face<S>6440</S> toward the mount<S>2022</S> Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And it was told<S>5046</S> Laban<S>3837</S> on the third<S>7992</S> day<S>3117</S> that Jacob<S>3290</S> was fled<S>1272</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> his brethren<S>251</S> with him, and pursued<S>7291</S> after him<S>310</S> seven<S>7651</S> days'<S>3117</S> journey<S>1870</S>; and they overtook<S>1692</S> him in the mount<S>2022</S> Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And God<S>430</S> came<S>935</S> to Laban<S>3837</S> the Syrian<S>761</S> in a dream<S>2472</S> by night<S>3915</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Take heed<S>8104</S> that thou speak<S>1696</S> not to<S>5973</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> either good<S>2896</S> or<S>5704</S> bad<S>7451</S>. <sup>either: Heb. from good to bad</sup>
Then Laban<S>3837</S> overtook<S>5381</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>. Now Jacob<S>3290</S> had pitched<S>8628</S> his tent<S>168</S> in the mount<S>2022</S>: and Laban<S>3837</S> with his brethren<S>251</S> pitched<S>8628</S> in the mount<S>2022</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And Laban<S>3837</S> said<S>559</S> to Jacob<S>3290</S>, What hast thou done<S>6213</S>, that thou hast stolen away<S>1589</S> unawares<S>3824</S> to me, and carried away<S>5090</S> my daughters<S>1323</S>, as captives<S>7617</S> taken with the sword<S>2719</S>?
Wherefore didst thou flee away<S>1272</S> secretly<S>2244</S>, and steal away<S>1589</S> from me; and didst not tell<S>5046</S> me, that I might have sent thee away<S>7971</S> with mirth<S>8057</S>, and with songs<S>7892</S>, with tabret<S>8596</S>, and with harp<S>3658</S>? <sup>steal: Heb. hast stolen me</sup>
And hast not suffered<S>5203</S> me to kiss<S>5401</S> my sons<S>1121</S> and my daughters<S>1323</S>? thou hast now done foolishly<S>5528</S> in so doing<S>6213</S>.
It is<S>3426</S> in the power<S>410</S> of my hand<S>3027</S> to do<S>6213</S> you hurt<S>7451</S>: but the God<S>430</S> of your father<S>1</S> spake<S>559</S> unto me yesternight<S>570</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Take thou heed<S>8104</S> that thou speak not<S>1696</S> to Jacob<S>3290</S> either good<S>2896</S> or bad<S>7451</S>.
And now, though thou wouldest needs<S>1980</S> be gone<S>1980</S>, because thou sore<S>3700</S> longedst<S>3700</S> after thy father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>, yet wherefore hast thou stolen<S>1589</S> my gods<S>430</S>?
And Jacob<S>3290</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> to Laban<S>3837</S>, Because I was afraid<S>3372</S>: for I said<S>559</S>, Peradventure<S>6435</S> thou wouldest take by force<S>1497</S> thy daughters<S>1323</S> from me.
With whomsoever<S>834</S> thou findest<S>4672</S> thy gods<S>430</S>, let him not live<S>2421</S>: before<S>5048</S> our brethren<S>251</S> discern<S>5234</S> thou what is thine with me, and take<S>3947</S> it to thee. For Jacob<S>3290</S> knew<S>3045</S> not that Rachel<S>7354</S> had stolen<S>1589</S> them.
And Laban<S>3837</S> went<S>935</S> into Jacob's<S>3290</S> tent<S>168</S>, and into Leah's<S>3812</S> tent<S>168</S>, and into the two<S>8147</S> maidservants'<S>519</S> tents<S>168</S>; but he found<S>4672</S> them not. Then went he out<S>3318</S> of Leah's<S>3812</S> tent<S>168</S>, and entered<S>935</S> into Rachel's<S>7354</S> tent<S>168</S>.
Now Rachel<S>7354</S> had taken<S>3947</S> the images<S>8655</S>, and put<S>7760</S> them in the camel's<S>1581</S> furniture<S>3733</S>, and sat<S>3427</S> upon them. And Laban<S>3837</S> searched<S>4959</S> all the tent<S>168</S>, but found<S>4672</S> them not. <sup>searched: Heb. felt</sup>
And she said<S>559</S> to her father<S>1</S>, Let it not displease<S>2734</S> <S>5869</S> my lord<S>113</S> that I cannot<S>3201</S> rise up<S>6965</S> before thee<S>6440</S>; for the custom<S>1870</S> of women<S>802</S> is upon me. And he searched<S>2664</S>, but found<S>4672</S> not the images<S>8655</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> was wroth<S>2734</S>, and chode<S>7378</S> with Laban<S>3837</S>: and Jacob<S>3290</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> to Laban<S>3837</S>, What is my trespass<S>6588</S>? what is my sin<S>2403</S>, that thou hast so hotly pursued<S>1814</S> after me<S>310</S>?
Whereas<S>3588</S> thou hast searched<S>4959</S> all my stuff<S>3627</S>, what hast thou found<S>4672</S> of all thy household<S>1004</S> stuff<S>3627</S>? set<S>7760</S> it here<S>3541</S> before my brethren<S>251</S> and thy brethren<S>251</S>, that they may judge<S>3198</S> betwixt<S>996</S> us both<S>8147</S>. <sup>searched: Heb. felt</sup>
This twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> have I been with thee; thy ewes<S>7353</S> and thy she goats<S>5795</S> have not cast their young<S>7921</S>, and the rams<S>352</S> of thy flock<S>6629</S> have I not eaten<S>398</S>.
That which was torn<S>2966</S> of beasts I brought<S>935</S> not unto thee; I bare the loss<S>2398</S> of it; of my hand<S>3027</S> didst thou require<S>1245</S> it, whether stolen<S>1589</S> by day<S>3117</S>, or stolen<S>1589</S> by night<S>3915</S>.
Thus I was; in the day<S>3117</S> the drought<S>2721</S> consumed<S>398</S> me, and the frost<S>7140</S> by night<S>3915</S>; and my sleep<S>8142</S> departed<S>5074</S> from mine eyes<S>5869</S>.
Thus have I been twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> in thy house<S>1004</S>; I served thee<S>5647</S> fourteen<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> for thy two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S>, and six<S>8337</S> years<S>8141</S> for thy cattle<S>6629</S>: and thou hast changed<S>2498</S> my wages<S>4909</S> ten<S>6235</S> times<S>4489</S>.
Except<S>3884</S> the God<S>430</S> of my father<S>1</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Abraham<S>85</S>, and the fear<S>6343</S> of Isaac<S>3327</S>, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away<S>7971</S> now empty<S>7387</S>.

And Laban<S>3837</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>, These daughters<S>1323</S> are my daughters<S>1323</S>, and these children<S>1121</S> are my children<S>1121</S>, and these cattle<S>6629</S> are my cattle<S>6629</S>, and all that thou seest<S>7200</S> is mine: and what can I do<S>6213</S> this day<S>3117</S> unto these my daughters<S>1323</S>, or<S>176</S> unto their children<S>1121</S> which they have born<S>3205</S>?
Now therefore come thou<S>3212</S>, let us make<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S>, I and thou; and let it be for a witness<S>5707</S> between me and thee.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> took<S>3947</S> a stone<S>68</S>, and set it up<S>7311</S> for a pillar<S>4676</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, Gather<S>3950</S> stones<S>68</S>; and they took<S>3947</S> stones<S>68</S>, and made<S>6213</S> an heap<S>1530</S>: and they did eat<S>398</S> there upon the heap<S>1530</S>.
And Laban<S>3837</S> called<S>7121</S> it Jegarsahadutha<S>3026</S>: but Jacob<S>3290</S> called<S>7121</S> it Galeed<S>1567</S>. <sup>Jegarsahadutha: that is, The heap of witness, Chaldee</sup> <sup>Galeed: that is, The heap of witness, Heb.</sup>

If thou shalt afflict<S>6031</S> my daughters<S>1323</S>, or if thou shalt take<S>3947</S> other wives<S>802</S> beside<S>5921</S> my daughters<S>1323</S>, no man<S>376</S> is with us; see<S>7200</S>, God<S>430</S> is witness<S>5707</S> betwixt me and thee.
And Laban<S>3837</S> said<S>559</S> to Jacob<S>3290</S>, Behold this heap<S>1530</S>, and behold this pillar<S>4676</S>, which I have cast<S>3384</S> betwixt me and thee;

Then Jacob<S>3290</S> offered<S>2076</S> sacrifice<S>2077</S> upon the mount<S>2022</S>, and called<S>7121</S> his brethren<S>251</S> to eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>: and they did eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, and tarried all night<S>3885</S> in the mount<S>2022</S>. <sup>offered: or, killed beasts</sup>

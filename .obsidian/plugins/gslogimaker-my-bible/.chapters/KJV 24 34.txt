The word<S>1697</S> which came unto Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, when Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and all his army<S>2428</S>, and all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the earth<S>776</S> of his dominion<S>3027</S> <S>4475</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S>, fought<S>3898</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and against all the cities<S>5892</S> thereof, saying<S>559</S>, <sup>of his: Heb. the dominion of his hand</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Go<S>1980</S> and speak<S>559</S> to Zedekiah<S>6667</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and tell<S>559</S> him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Behold, I will give<S>5414</S> this city<S>5892</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and he shall burn<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>:
And thou shalt not escape out<S>4422</S> of his hand<S>3027</S>, but shalt surely<S>8610</S> be taken<S>8610</S>, and delivered<S>5414</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>; and thine eyes<S>5869</S> shall behold<S>7200</S> the eyes<S>5869</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and he shall speak<S>1696</S> with thee mouth<S>6310</S> to mouth<S>6310</S>, and thou shalt go<S>935</S> to Babylon<S>894</S>. <sup>he shall: Heb. his mouth shall speak to thy mouth</sup>
Yet hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, O Zedekiah<S>6667</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>; Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of thee, Thou shalt not die<S>4191</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>:
But thou shalt die<S>4191</S> in peace<S>7965</S>: and with the burnings<S>4955</S> of thy fathers<S>1</S>, the former<S>7223</S> kings<S>4428</S> which were before<S>6440</S> thee, so shall they burn<S>8313</S> odours for thee; and they will lament<S>5594</S> thee, saying, Ah<S>1945</S> lord<S>113</S>! for I have pronounced<S>1696</S> the word<S>1697</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Then Jeremiah<S>3414</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> spake<S>1696</S> all these words<S>1697</S> unto Zedekiah<S>6667</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>,
When the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon's<S>894</S> army<S>2428</S> fought<S>3898</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and against all the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> that were left<S>3498</S>, against Lachish<S>3923</S>, and against Azekah<S>5825</S>: for these defenced<S>4013</S> cities<S>5892</S> remained<S>7604</S> of the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
This is the word<S>1697</S> that came unto Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, after<S>310</S> that the king<S>4428</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S> had made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with all the people<S>5971</S> which were at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, to proclaim<S>7121</S> liberty<S>1865</S> unto them;
That every man<S>376</S> should let his manservant<S>5650</S>, and every man<S>376</S> his maidservant<S>8198</S>, being an Hebrew<S>5680</S> or an Hebrewess<S>5680</S>, go<S>7971</S> free<S>2670</S>; that none should serve<S>5647</S> himself of them, to wit, of a Jew<S>3064</S> his brother<S>251</S>.
Now when all the princes<S>8269</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S>, which had entered<S>935</S> into the covenant<S>1285</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that every one<S>376</S> should let his manservant<S>5650</S>, and every one<S>376</S> his maidservant<S>8198</S>, go<S>7971</S> free<S>2670</S>, that none should serve<S>5647</S> themselves of them any more, then they obeyed<S>8085</S>, and let them go<S>7971</S>.
But afterward<S>310</S> they turned<S>7725</S>, and caused the servants<S>5650</S> and the handmaids<S>8198</S>, whom they had let go<S>7971</S> free<S>2670</S>, to return<S>7725</S>, and brought them into subjection<S>3533</S> <S>3533</S> for servants<S>5650</S> and for handmaids<S>8198</S>.
Therefore the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; I made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with your fathers<S>1</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that I brought them forth<S>3318</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, out of the house<S>1004</S> of bondmen<S>5650</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
At the end<S>7093</S> of seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> let ye go<S>7971</S> every man<S>376</S> his brother<S>251</S> an Hebrew<S>5680</S>, which hath been sold<S>4376</S> unto thee; and when he hath served<S>5647</S> thee six<S>8337</S> years<S>8141</S>, thou shalt let him go<S>7971</S> free<S>2670</S> from thee: but your fathers<S>1</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto me, neither inclined<S>5186</S> their ear<S>241</S>. <sup>hath been: or, hath sold himself</sup>
And ye were now<S>3117</S> turned<S>7725</S>, and had done<S>6213</S> right<S>3477</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>, in proclaiming<S>7121</S> liberty<S>1865</S> every man<S>376</S> to his neighbour<S>7453</S>; and ye had made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> before<S>6440</S> me in the house<S>1004</S> which is called<S>7121</S> by my name<S>8034</S>: <sup>now: Heb. to day</sup> <sup>which: Heb. whereupon my name is called</sup>
But ye turned<S>7725</S> and polluted<S>2490</S> my name<S>8034</S>, and caused every man<S>376</S> his servant<S>5650</S>, and every man<S>376</S> his handmaid<S>8198</S>, whom ye had set<S>7971</S> at liberty<S>2670</S> at their pleasure<S>5315</S>, to return<S>7725</S>, and brought them into subjection<S>3533</S>, to be unto you for servants<S>5650</S> and for handmaids<S>8198</S>.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Ye have not hearkened<S>8085</S> unto me, in proclaiming<S>7121</S> liberty<S>1865</S>, every one<S>376</S> to his brother<S>251</S>, and every man<S>376</S> to his neighbour<S>7453</S>: behold, I proclaim<S>7121</S> a liberty<S>1865</S> for you, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to the sword<S>2719</S>, to the pestilence<S>1698</S>, and to the famine<S>7458</S>; and I will make<S>5414</S> you to be removed<S>2189</S> <S>2113</S> into all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>to be: Heb. for a removing</sup>
And I will give<S>5414</S> the men<S>582</S> that have transgressed<S>5674</S> my covenant<S>1285</S>, which have not performed<S>6965</S> the words<S>1697</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> which they had made<S>3772</S> before<S>6440</S> me, when they cut<S>3772</S> the calf<S>5695</S> in twain<S>8147</S>, and passed<S>5674</S> between the parts<S>1335</S> thereof,
The princes<S>8269</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and the princes<S>8269</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, the eunuchs<S>5631</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, which passed<S>5674</S> between the parts<S>1335</S> of the calf<S>5695</S>;
I will even give<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>341</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of them that seek<S>1245</S> their life<S>5315</S>: and their dead bodies<S>5038</S> shall be for meat<S>3978</S> unto the fowls<S>5775</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S>, and to the beasts<S>929</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
And Zedekiah<S>6667</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and his princes<S>8269</S> will I give<S>5414</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of their enemies<S>341</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of them that seek<S>1245</S> their life<S>5315</S>, and into the hand<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon's<S>894</S> army<S>2428</S>, which are gone up<S>5927</S> from you.
Behold, I will command<S>6680</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and cause them to return<S>7725</S> to this city<S>5892</S>; and they shall fight<S>3898</S> against it, and take<S>3920</S> it, and burn<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>: and I will make<S>5414</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> a desolation<S>8077</S> without an inhabitant<S>3427</S>.

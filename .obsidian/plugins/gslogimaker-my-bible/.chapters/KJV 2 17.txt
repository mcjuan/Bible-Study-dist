And all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> journeyed<S>5265</S> from the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Sin<S>5512</S>, after their journeys<S>4550</S>, according to the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> in Rephidim<S>7508</S>: and there was no water<S>4325</S> for the people<S>5971</S> to drink<S>8354</S>.
Wherefore the people<S>5971</S> did chide<S>7378</S> with Moses<S>4872</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> us water<S>4325</S> that we may drink<S>8354</S>. And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Why chide<S>7378</S> ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt<S>5254</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>?
And the people<S>5971</S> thirsted<S>6770</S> there for water<S>4325</S>; and the people<S>5971</S> murmured<S>3885</S> against Moses<S>4872</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought<S>5927</S> us up out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, to kill<S>4191</S> us and our children<S>1121</S> and our cattle<S>4735</S> with thirst<S>6772</S>?
And Moses<S>4872</S> cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, What shall I do<S>6213</S> unto this people<S>5971</S>? they be almost<S>4592</S> ready to stone<S>5619</S> me.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Go on<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S>, and take<S>3947</S> with thee of the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; and thy rod<S>4294</S>, wherewith thou smotest<S>5221</S> the river<S>2975</S>, take<S>3947</S> in thine hand<S>3027</S>, and go<S>1980</S>.
Behold, I will stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> thee there upon the rock<S>6697</S> in Horeb<S>2722</S>; and thou shalt smite<S>5221</S> the rock<S>6697</S>, and there shall come<S>3318</S> water<S>4325</S> out of it, that the people<S>5971</S> may drink<S>8354</S>. And Moses<S>4872</S> did<S>6213</S> so in the sight<S>5869</S> of the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the place<S>4725</S> Massah<S>4532</S>, and Meribah<S>4809</S>, because of the chiding<S>7379</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and because they tempted<S>5254</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Is<S>3426</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> among<S>7130</S> us, or not? <sup>Massah: that is, Temptation</sup> <sup>Meribah: that is, Chiding, or, Strife</sup>
Then came<S>935</S> Amalek<S>6002</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with Israel<S>3478</S> in Rephidim<S>7508</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Choose us out<S>977</S> men<S>582</S>, and go out<S>3318</S>, fight<S>3898</S> with Amalek<S>6002</S>: to morrow<S>4279</S> I will stand<S>5324</S> on the top<S>7218</S> of the hill<S>1389</S> with the rod<S>4294</S> of God<S>430</S> in mine hand<S>3027</S>. <sup>Joshua: called Jesus</sup>
So Joshua<S>3091</S> did<S>6213</S> as Moses<S>4872</S> had said<S>559</S> to him, and fought<S>3898</S> with Amalek<S>6002</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S>, Aaron<S>175</S>, and Hur<S>2354</S> went up<S>5927</S> to the top<S>7218</S> of the hill<S>1389</S>.
And it came to pass, when Moses<S>4872</S> held up<S>7311</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, that Israel<S>3478</S> prevailed<S>1396</S>: and when he let down<S>5117</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, Amalek<S>6002</S> prevailed<S>1396</S>.
But Moses'<S>4872</S> hands<S>3027</S> were heavy<S>3515</S>; and they took<S>3947</S> a stone<S>68</S>, and put<S>7760</S> it under him, and he sat<S>3427</S> thereon; and Aaron<S>175</S> and Hur<S>2354</S> stayed up<S>8551</S> his hands<S>3027</S>, the one on the one side<S>259</S>, and the other on the other side<S>259</S>; and his hands<S>3027</S> were steady<S>530</S> until the going down<S>935</S> of the sun<S>8121</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> discomfited<S>2522</S> Amalek<S>6002</S> and his people<S>5971</S> with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Write<S>3789</S> this for a memorial<S>2146</S> in a book<S>5612</S>, and rehearse<S>7760</S> it in the ears<S>241</S> of Joshua<S>3091</S>: for I will utterly<S>4229</S> put out<S>4229</S> the remembrance<S>2143</S> of Amalek<S>6002</S> from under heaven<S>8064</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> built<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S>, and called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of it Jehovahnissi<S>3071</S>: <sup>Jehovahnissi: that is, The LORD my banner</sup>
For he said<S>559</S>, Because the LORD<S>3050</S> hath sworn<S>3027</S> <S>3676</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> will have war<S>4421</S> with Amalek<S>6002</S> from generation<S>1755</S> to generation<S>1755</S>. <sup>Because: or, Because the hand of Amalek is against the throne of the LORD, therefore, etc</sup> <sup>the LORD hath: Heb. the hand upon the throne of the LORD</sup>

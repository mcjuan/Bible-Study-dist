Also, thou son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, prophesy<S>5012</S> unto the mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and say<S>559</S>, Ye mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>:
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Because the enemy<S>341</S> hath said<S>559</S> against you, Aha<S>1889</S>, even the ancient<S>5769</S> high places<S>1116</S> are ours in possession<S>4181</S>:
Therefore prophesy<S>5012</S> and say<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Because they have made you desolate<S>8074</S>, and swallowed you up<S>7602</S> on every side<S>5439</S>, that ye might be a possession<S>4181</S> unto the residue<S>7611</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>, and ye are taken up<S>5927</S> in the lips<S>8193</S> of talkers<S>3956</S>, and are an infamy<S>1681</S> of the people<S>5971</S>: <sup>Because: Heb. Because for because</sup> <sup>are: or, ye are made to come up on the lip of the tongue</sup>
Therefore, ye mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> to the mountains<S>2022</S>, and to the hills<S>1389</S>, to the rivers<S>650</S>, and to the valleys<S>1516</S>, to the desolate<S>8074</S> wastes<S>2723</S>, and to the cities<S>5892</S> that are forsaken<S>5800</S>, which became a prey<S>957</S> and derision<S>3933</S> to the residue<S>7611</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S> that are round about<S>5439</S>; <sup>rivers: or, bottoms, or, dales</sup>
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Surely in the fire<S>784</S> of my jealousy<S>7068</S> have I spoken<S>1696</S> against the residue<S>7611</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>, and against all Idumea<S>123</S>, which have appointed<S>5414</S> my land<S>776</S> into their possession<S>4181</S> with the joy<S>8057</S> of all their heart<S>3824</S>, with despiteful<S>7589</S> minds<S>5315</S>, to cast it out<S>4054</S> for a prey<S>957</S>.
Prophesy<S>5012</S> therefore concerning the land<S>127</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto the mountains<S>2022</S>, and to the hills<S>1389</S>, to the rivers<S>650</S>, and to the valleys<S>1516</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Behold, I have spoken<S>1696</S> in my jealousy<S>7068</S> and in my fury<S>2534</S>, because ye have borne<S>5375</S> the shame<S>3639</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>:
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; I have lifted up<S>5375</S> mine hand<S>3027</S>, Surely the heathen<S>1471</S> that are about<S>5439</S> you, they shall bear<S>5375</S> their shame<S>3639</S>.
But ye, O mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, ye shall shoot forth<S>5414</S> your branches<S>6057</S>, and yield<S>5375</S> your fruit<S>6529</S> to my people<S>5971</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; for they are at hand<S>7126</S> to come<S>935</S>.
For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn<S>6437</S> unto you, and ye shall be tilled<S>5647</S> and sown<S>2232</S>:
And I will multiply<S>7235</S> men<S>120</S> upon you, all the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, even all of it: and the cities<S>5892</S> shall be inhabited<S>3427</S>, and the wastes<S>2723</S> shall be builded<S>1129</S>:
And I will multiply<S>7235</S> upon you man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S>; and they shall increase<S>7235</S> and bring fruit<S>6509</S>: and I will settle<S>3427</S> you after your old estates<S>6927</S>, and will do better<S>2895</S> unto you than at your beginnings<S>7221</S>: and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Yea, I will cause men<S>120</S> to walk<S>3212</S> upon you, even my people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>; and they shall possess<S>3423</S> thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance<S>5159</S>, and thou shalt no more<S>3254</S> henceforth bereave<S>7921</S> them of men.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Because they say<S>559</S> unto you, Thou land devourest up<S>398</S> men<S>120</S>, and hast bereaved<S>7921</S> thy nations<S>1471</S>;
Therefore thou shalt devour<S>398</S> men<S>120</S> no more, neither bereave<S>7921</S> <S>3782</S> thy nations<S>1471</S> any more, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>. <sup>bereave: or, cause to fall</sup>
Neither will I cause men to hear<S>8085</S> in thee the shame<S>3639</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S> any more, neither shalt thou bear<S>5375</S> the reproach<S>2781</S> of the people<S>5971</S> any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations<S>1471</S> to fall<S>3782</S> any more, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>.
Moreover the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, when the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> in their own land<S>127</S>, they defiled<S>2930</S> it by their own way<S>1870</S> and by their doings<S>5949</S>: their way<S>1870</S> was before<S>6440</S> me as the uncleanness<S>2932</S> of a removed woman<S>5079</S>.
Wherefore I poured<S>8210</S> my fury<S>2534</S> upon them for the blood<S>1818</S> that they had shed<S>8210</S> upon the land<S>776</S>, and for their idols<S>1544</S> wherewith they had polluted<S>2930</S> it:
And I scattered<S>6327</S> them among the heathen<S>1471</S>, and they were dispersed<S>2219</S> through the countries<S>776</S>: according to their way<S>1870</S> and according to their doings<S>5949</S> I judged<S>8199</S> them.
And when they entered<S>935</S> unto the heathen<S>1471</S>, whither they went<S>935</S>, they profaned<S>2490</S> my holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>, when they said<S>559</S> to them, These are the people<S>5971</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and are gone forth<S>3318</S> out of his land<S>776</S>.
But I had pity<S>2550</S> for mine holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>, which the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> had profaned<S>2490</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, whither they went<S>935</S>.
Therefore say<S>559</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; I do<S>6213</S> not this for your sakes, O house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, but for mine holy<S>6944</S> name's<S>8034</S> sake, which ye have profaned<S>2490</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, whither ye went<S>935</S>.
And I will sanctify<S>6942</S> my great<S>1419</S> name<S>8034</S>, which was profaned<S>2490</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, which ye have profaned<S>2490</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of them; and the heathen<S>1471</S> shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, when I shall be sanctified<S>6942</S> in you before their eyes<S>5869</S>. <sup>their: or, your</sup>
For I will take<S>3947</S> you from among<S>4480</S> the heathen<S>1471</S>, and gather<S>6908</S> you out of all countries<S>776</S>, and will bring<S>935</S> you into your own land<S>127</S>.
Then will I sprinkle<S>2236</S> clean<S>2889</S> water<S>4325</S> upon you, and ye shall be clean<S>2891</S>: from all your filthiness<S>2932</S>, and from all your idols<S>1544</S>, will I cleanse<S>2891</S> you.
A new<S>2319</S> heart<S>3820</S> also will I give<S>5414</S> you, and a new<S>2319</S> spirit<S>7307</S> will I put<S>5414</S> within<S>7130</S> you: and I will take away<S>5493</S> the stony<S>68</S> heart<S>3820</S> out of your flesh<S>1320</S>, and I will give<S>5414</S> you an heart<S>3820</S> of flesh<S>1320</S>.
And I will put<S>5414</S> my spirit<S>7307</S> within<S>7130</S> you, and cause<S>6213</S> you to walk<S>3212</S> in my statutes<S>2706</S>, and ye shall keep<S>8104</S> my judgments<S>4941</S>, and do<S>6213</S> them.
And ye shall dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> that I gave<S>5414</S> to your fathers<S>1</S>; and ye shall be my people<S>5971</S>, and I will be your God<S>430</S>.
I will also save<S>3467</S> you from all your uncleannesses<S>2932</S>: and I will call<S>7121</S> for the corn<S>1715</S>, and will increase<S>7235</S> it, and lay<S>5414</S> no famine<S>7458</S> upon you.
And I will multiply<S>7235</S> the fruit<S>6529</S> of the tree<S>6086</S>, and the increase<S>8570</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, that ye shall receive<S>3947</S> no more reproach<S>2781</S> of famine<S>7458</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>.
Then shall ye remember<S>2142</S> your own evil<S>7451</S> ways<S>1870</S>, and your doings<S>4611</S> that were not good<S>2896</S>, and shall lothe<S>6962</S> yourselves in your own sight<S>6440</S> for your iniquities<S>5771</S> and for your abominations<S>8441</S>.
Not for your sakes do<S>6213</S> I this, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, be it known<S>3045</S> unto you: be ashamed<S>954</S> and confounded<S>3637</S> for your own ways<S>1870</S>, O house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; In the day<S>3117</S> that I shall have cleansed<S>2891</S> you from all your iniquities<S>5771</S> I will also cause you to dwell<S>3427</S> in the cities<S>5892</S>, and the wastes<S>2723</S> shall be builded<S>1129</S>.
And the desolate<S>8074</S> land<S>776</S> shall be tilled<S>5647</S>, whereas it lay desolate<S>8077</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of all that passed by<S>5674</S>.
And they shall say<S>559</S>, This<S>1977</S> land<S>776</S> that was desolate<S>8074</S> is become like the garden<S>1588</S> of Eden<S>5731</S>; and the waste<S>2720</S> and desolate<S>8074</S> and ruined<S>2040</S> cities<S>5892</S> are become fenced<S>1219</S>, and are inhabited<S>3427</S>.
Then the heathen<S>1471</S> that are left<S>7604</S> round about<S>5439</S> you shall know<S>3045</S> that I the LORD<S>3068</S> build<S>1129</S> the ruined<S>2040</S> places, and plant<S>5193</S> that that was desolate<S>8074</S>: I the LORD<S>3068</S> have spoken<S>1696</S> it, and I will do<S>6213</S> it.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; I will yet for this be enquired<S>1875</S> of by the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, to do<S>6213</S> it for them; I will increase<S>7235</S> them with men<S>120</S> like a flock<S>6629</S>.
As the holy<S>6944</S> flock<S>6629</S>, as the flock<S>6629</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> in her solemn feasts<S>4150</S>; so shall the waste<S>2720</S> cities<S>5892</S> be filled<S>4392</S> with flocks<S>6629</S> of men<S>120</S>: and they shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>holy: Heb. flock of holy things</sup>

David<S>1732</S> therefore departed<S>3212</S> thence, and escaped<S>4422</S> to the cave<S>4631</S> Adullam<S>5725</S>: and when his brethren<S>251</S> and all his father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S> heard<S>8085</S> it, they went down<S>3381</S> thither to him.
And every one<S>376</S> that was in distress<S>4689</S>, and every one<S>376</S> that was in debt<S>5378</S>, and every one<S>376</S> that was discontented<S>4751</S> <S>5315</S>, gathered<S>6908</S> themselves unto him; and he became a captain<S>8269</S> over them: and there were with him about four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S>. <sup>was in debt: Heb. had a creditor</sup> <sup>discontented: Heb. bitter of soul</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> went<S>3212</S> thence to Mizpeh<S>4708</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>: and he said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, Let my father<S>1</S> and my mother<S>517</S>, I pray thee, come forth<S>3318</S>, and be with you, till I know<S>3045</S> what God<S>430</S> will do<S>6213</S> for me.
And he brought<S>5148</S> them before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>: and they dwelt<S>3427</S> with him all the while<S>3117</S> that David<S>1732</S> was in the hold<S>4686</S>.
And the prophet<S>5030</S> Gad<S>1410</S> said<S>559</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, Abide<S>3427</S> not in the hold<S>4686</S>; depart<S>3212</S>, and get<S>935</S> thee into the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>. Then David<S>1732</S> departed<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> into the forest<S>3293</S> of Hareth<S>2802</S>.
When Saul<S>7586</S> heard<S>8085</S> that David<S>1732</S> was discovered<S>3045</S>, and the men<S>582</S> that were with him, (now Saul<S>7586</S> abode<S>3427</S> in Gibeah<S>1390</S> under a tree<S>815</S> in Ramah<S>7414</S>, having his spear<S>2595</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>, and all his servants<S>5650</S> were standing<S>5324</S> about him;) <sup>tree: or, grove in a high place</sup>
Then Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S> unto his servants<S>5650</S> that stood<S>5324</S> about him, Hear now<S>8085</S>, ye Benjamites<S>1145</S>; will the son<S>1121</S> of Jesse<S>3448</S> give<S>5414</S> every one of you fields<S>7704</S> and vineyards<S>3754</S>, and make<S>7760</S> you all captains<S>8269</S> of thousands<S>505</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> of hundreds<S>3967</S>;
That all of you have conspired<S>7194</S> against me, and there is none that sheweth<S>1540</S> <S>241</S> me that my son<S>1121</S> hath made a league<S>3772</S> with the son<S>1121</S> of Jesse<S>3448</S>, and there is none of you that is sorry<S>2470</S> for me, or sheweth<S>1540</S> <S>241</S> unto me that my son<S>1121</S> hath stirred up<S>6965</S> my servant<S>5650</S> against me, to lie in wait<S>693</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>? <sup>sheweth: Heb. uncovereth mine ear</sup>
Then answered<S>6030</S> Doeg<S>1673</S> the Edomite<S>130</S>, which was set<S>5324</S> over the servants<S>5650</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I saw<S>7200</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jesse<S>3448</S> coming<S>935</S> to Nob<S>5011</S>, to Ahimelech<S>288</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahitub<S>285</S>.
And he enquired<S>7592</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> for him, and gave<S>5414</S> him victuals<S>6720</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> him the sword<S>2719</S> of Goliath<S>1555</S> the Philistine<S>6430</S>.
Then the king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S> to call<S>7121</S> Ahimelech<S>288</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Ahitub<S>285</S>, and all his father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>, the priests<S>3548</S> that were in Nob<S>5011</S>: and they came<S>935</S> all of them to the king<S>4428</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> now, thou son<S>1121</S> of Ahitub<S>285</S>. And he answered<S>559</S>, Here I am, my lord<S>113</S>. <sup>Here: Heb. Behold me</sup>
And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Why have ye conspired<S>7194</S> against me, thou and the son<S>1121</S> of Jesse<S>3448</S>, in that thou hast given<S>5414</S> him bread<S>3899</S>, and a sword<S>2719</S>, and hast enquired<S>7592</S> of God<S>430</S> for him, that he should rise<S>6965</S> against me, to lie in wait<S>693</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>?
Then Ahimelech<S>288</S> answered<S>6030</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and said<S>559</S>, And who is so faithful<S>539</S> among all thy servants<S>5650</S> as David<S>1732</S>, which is the king's<S>4428</S> son in law<S>2860</S>, and goeth<S>5493</S> at thy bidding<S>4928</S>, and is honourable<S>3513</S> in thine house<S>1004</S>?
Did I then<S>3117</S> begin<S>2490</S> to enquire<S>7592</S> of God<S>430</S> for him? be it far from me<S>2486</S>: let not the king<S>4428</S> impute<S>7760</S> any thing<S>1697</S> unto his servant<S>5650</S>, nor to all the house<S>1004</S> of my father<S>1</S>: for thy servant<S>5650</S> knew<S>3045</S> nothing<S>1697</S> of all this, less<S>6996</S> or more<S>1419</S>. <sup>less: Heb. little or great</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Thou shalt surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>, Ahimelech<S>288</S>, thou, and all thy father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto the footmen<S>7323</S> that stood<S>5324</S> about him, Turn<S>5437</S>, and slay<S>4191</S> the priests<S>3548</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; because their hand<S>3027</S> also is with David<S>1732</S>, and because they knew<S>3045</S> when he fled<S>1272</S>, and did not shew<S>1540</S> <S>241</S> it to me. But the servants<S>5650</S> of the king<S>4428</S> would<S>14</S> not put forth<S>7971</S> their hand<S>3027</S> to fall<S>6293</S> upon the priests<S>3548</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>footmen: or, guard: Heb. runners</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> to Doeg<S>1673</S>, Turn<S>5437</S> thou, and fall<S>6293</S> upon the priests<S>3548</S>. And Doeg<S>1673</S> the Edomite<S>130</S> turned<S>5437</S>, and he fell<S>6293</S> upon the priests<S>3548</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> on that day<S>3117</S> fourscore<S>8084</S> and five<S>2568</S> persons<S>376</S> that did wear<S>5375</S> a linen<S>906</S> ephod<S>646</S>.
And Nob<S>5011</S>, the city<S>5892</S> of the priests<S>3548</S>, smote<S>5221</S> he with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, both men<S>376</S> and women<S>802</S>, children<S>5768</S> and sucklings<S>3243</S>, and oxen<S>7794</S>, and asses<S>2543</S>, and sheep<S>7716</S>, with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>.
And one<S>259</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Ahimelech<S>288</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahitub<S>285</S>, named<S>8034</S> Abiathar<S>54</S>, escaped<S>4422</S>, and fled<S>1272</S> after<S>310</S> David<S>1732</S>.
And Abiathar<S>54</S> shewed<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> had slain<S>2026</S> the LORD'S<S>3068</S> priests<S>3548</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abiathar<S>54</S>, I knew<S>3045</S> it that day<S>3117</S>, when Doeg<S>1673</S> the Edomite<S>130</S> was there, that he would surely<S>5046</S> tell<S>5046</S> Saul<S>7586</S>: I have occasioned<S>5437</S> the death of all the persons<S>5315</S> of thy father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>.
Abide<S>3427</S> thou with me, fear<S>3372</S> not: for he that seeketh<S>1245</S> my life<S>5315</S> seeketh<S>1245</S> thy life<S>5315</S>: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard<S>4931</S>.

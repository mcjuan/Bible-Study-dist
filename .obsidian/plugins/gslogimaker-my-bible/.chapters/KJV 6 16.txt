And the lot<S>1486</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S> fell<S>3318</S> from Jordan<S>3383</S> by Jericho<S>3405</S>, unto the water<S>4325</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S> on the east<S>4217</S>, to the wilderness<S>4057</S> that goeth up<S>5927</S> from Jericho<S>3405</S> throughout mount<S>2022</S> Bethel<S>1008</S>, <sup>fell: Heb. went forth</sup>
And goeth out<S>3318</S> from Bethel<S>1008</S> to Luz<S>3870</S>, and passeth along<S>5674</S> unto the borders<S>1366</S> of Archi<S>757</S> to Ataroth<S>5852</S>,
And goeth down<S>3381</S> westward<S>3220</S> to the coast<S>1366</S> of Japhleti<S>3311</S>, unto the coast<S>1366</S> of Bethhoron<S>1032</S> the nether<S>8481</S>, and to Gezer<S>1507</S>: and the goings out<S>8444</S> thereof are at the sea<S>3220</S>.
So the children<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, Manasseh<S>4519</S> and Ephraim<S>669</S>, took their inheritance<S>5157</S>.
And the border<S>1366</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> according to their families<S>4940</S> was thus: even the border<S>1366</S> of their inheritance<S>5159</S> on the east side<S>4217</S> was Atarothaddar<S>5853</S>, unto Bethhoron<S>1032</S> the upper<S>5945</S>;
And the border<S>1366</S> went out<S>3318</S> toward the sea<S>3220</S> to Michmethah<S>4366</S> on the north side<S>6828</S>; and the border<S>1366</S> went about<S>5437</S> eastward<S>4217</S> unto Taanathshiloh<S>8387</S>, and passed<S>5674</S> by it on the east<S>4217</S> to Janohah<S>3239</S>;
And it went down<S>3381</S> from Janohah<S>3239</S> to Ataroth<S>5852</S>, and to Naarath<S>5292</S>, and came<S>6293</S> to Jericho<S>3405</S>, and went out<S>3318</S> at Jordan<S>3383</S>.
The border<S>1366</S> went out<S>3212</S> from Tappuah<S>8599</S> westward<S>3220</S> unto the river<S>5158</S> Kanah<S>7071</S>; and the goings out<S>8444</S> thereof were at the sea<S>3220</S>. This is the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the tribe<S>4294</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> by their families<S>4940</S>.
And the separate<S>3995</S> cities<S>5892</S> for the children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> were among<S>8432</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, all the cities<S>5892</S> with their villages<S>2691</S>.
And they drave not out<S>3423</S> the Canaanites<S>3669</S> that dwelt<S>3427</S> in Gezer<S>1507</S>: but the Canaanites<S>3669</S> dwell<S>3427</S> among<S>7130</S> the Ephraimites<S>669</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> under tribute<S>4522</S>.

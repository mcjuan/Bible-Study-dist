Behold my servant<S>5650</S>, whom I uphold<S>8551</S>; mine elect<S>972</S>, in whom my soul<S>5315</S> delighteth<S>7521</S>; I have put<S>5414</S> my spirit<S>7307</S> upon him: he shall bring forth<S>3318</S> judgment<S>4941</S> to the Gentiles<S>1471</S>.
He shall not cry<S>6817</S>, nor lift up<S>5375</S>, nor cause his voice<S>6963</S> to be heard<S>8085</S> in the street<S>2351</S>.
A bruised<S>7533</S> reed<S>7070</S> shall he not break<S>7665</S>, and the smoking<S>3544</S> flax<S>6594</S> shall he not quench<S>3518</S>: he shall bring forth<S>3318</S> judgment<S>4941</S> unto truth<S>571</S>. <sup>smoking: or, dimly burning</sup> <sup>quench: Heb. quench it</sup>
He shall not fail<S>3543</S> nor be discouraged<S>7533</S>, till he have set<S>7760</S> judgment<S>4941</S> in the earth<S>776</S>: and the isles<S>339</S> shall wait<S>3176</S> for his law<S>8451</S>. <sup>discouraged: Heb. broken</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> God<S>410</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, he that created<S>1254</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>, and stretched them out<S>5186</S>; he that spread forth<S>7554</S> the earth<S>776</S>, and that which cometh out<S>6631</S> of it; he that giveth<S>5414</S> breath<S>5397</S> unto the people<S>5971</S> upon it, and spirit<S>7307</S> to them that walk<S>1980</S> therein:
I the LORD<S>3068</S> have called<S>7121</S> thee in righteousness<S>6664</S>, and will hold<S>2388</S> thine hand<S>3027</S>, and will keep<S>5341</S> thee, and give<S>5414</S> thee for a covenant<S>1285</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, for a light<S>216</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S>;
To open<S>6491</S> the blind<S>5787</S> eyes<S>5869</S>, to bring out<S>3318</S> the prisoners<S>616</S> from the prison<S>4525</S>, and them that sit<S>3427</S> in darkness<S>2822</S> out of the prison<S>3608</S> house<S>1004</S>.
I am the LORD<S>3068</S>: that is my name<S>8034</S>: and my glory<S>3519</S> will I not give<S>5414</S> to another<S>312</S>, neither my praise<S>8416</S> to graven images<S>6456</S>.
Behold, the former things<S>7223</S> are come to pass<S>935</S>, and new things<S>2319</S> do I declare<S>5046</S>: before they spring forth<S>6779</S> I tell<S>8085</S> you of them.
Sing<S>7891</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> a new<S>2319</S> song<S>7892</S>, and his praise<S>8416</S> from the end<S>7097</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, ye that go down<S>3381</S> to the sea<S>3220</S>, and all that is therein<S>4393</S>; the isles<S>339</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof. <sup>all: Heb. the fulness thereof</sup>
Let the wilderness<S>4057</S> and the cities<S>5892</S> thereof lift up<S>5375</S> their voice, the villages<S>2691</S> that Kedar<S>6938</S> doth inhabit<S>3427</S>: let the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the rock<S>5553</S> sing<S>7442</S>, let them shout<S>6681</S> from the top<S>7218</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>.
Let them give<S>7760</S> glory<S>3519</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and declare<S>5046</S> his praise<S>8416</S> in the islands<S>339</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> shall go forth<S>3318</S> as a mighty man<S>1368</S>, he shall stir up<S>5782</S> jealousy<S>7068</S> like a man<S>376</S> of war<S>4421</S>: he shall cry<S>7321</S>, yea, roar<S>6873</S>; he shall prevail<S>1396</S> against his enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>prevail: or, behave himself mightily</sup>
I have long time<S>5769</S> holden my peace<S>2814</S>; I have been still<S>2790</S>, and refrained<S>662</S> myself: now will I cry<S>6463</S> like a travailing woman<S>3205</S>; I will destroy<S>5395</S> <S>8074</S> and devour<S>7602</S> at once<S>3162</S>. <sup>devour: Heb. swallow, or, sup up</sup>
I will make waste<S>2717</S> mountains<S>2022</S> and hills<S>1389</S>, and dry up<S>3001</S> all their herbs<S>6212</S>; and I will make<S>7760</S> the rivers<S>5104</S> islands<S>339</S>, and I will dry up<S>3001</S> the pools<S>98</S>.
And I will bring<S>3212</S> the blind<S>5787</S> by a way<S>1870</S> that they knew<S>3045</S> not; I will lead<S>1869</S> them in paths<S>5410</S> that they have not known<S>3045</S>: I will make<S>7760</S> darkness<S>4285</S> light<S>216</S> before<S>6440</S> them, and crooked things<S>4625</S> straight<S>4334</S>. These things<S>1697</S> will I do<S>6213</S> unto them, and not forsake<S>5800</S> them. <sup>straight: Heb. into straightness</sup>
They shall be turned<S>5472</S> back<S>268</S>, they shall be greatly<S>1322</S> ashamed<S>954</S>, that trust<S>982</S> in graven images<S>6459</S>, that say<S>559</S> to the molten images<S>4541</S>, Ye are our gods<S>430</S>.
Hear<S>8085</S>, ye deaf<S>2795</S>; and look<S>5027</S>, ye blind<S>5787</S>, that ye may see<S>7200</S>.
Who is blind<S>5787</S>, but my servant<S>5650</S>? or deaf<S>2795</S>, as my messenger<S>4397</S> that I sent<S>7971</S>? who is blind<S>5787</S> as he that is perfect<S>7999</S>, and blind<S>5787</S> as the LORD'S<S>3068</S> servant<S>5650</S>?
Seeing<S>7200</S> <S>7200</S> many things<S>7227</S>, but thou observest<S>8104</S> not; opening<S>6491</S> the ears<S>241</S>, but he heareth<S>8085</S> not.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is well pleased<S>2654</S> for his righteousness'<S>6664</S> sake; he will magnify<S>1431</S> the law<S>8451</S>, and make it honourable<S>142</S>. <sup>it: or, him</sup>
But this is a people<S>5971</S> robbed<S>962</S> and spoiled<S>8154</S>; they are all of them snared<S>6351</S> in holes<S>2352</S> <S>970</S>, and they are hid<S>2244</S> in prison<S>3608</S> houses<S>1004</S>: they are for a prey<S>957</S>, and none delivereth<S>5337</S>; for a spoil<S>4933</S>, and none saith<S>559</S>, Restore<S>7725</S>. <sup>they are all: or, in snaring all the young men of them</sup> <sup>for a spoil: Heb. a treading</sup>
Who among you will give ear<S>238</S> to this? who will hearken<S>7181</S> and hear<S>8085</S> for the time to come<S>268</S>? <sup>for: Heb. for the after time?</sup>
Who gave<S>5414</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> for a spoil<S>4933</S> <S>4882</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> to the robbers<S>962</S>? did not the LORD<S>3068</S>, he against whom<S>2098</S> we have sinned<S>2398</S>? for they would<S>14</S> not walk<S>1980</S> in his ways<S>1870</S>, neither were they obedient<S>8085</S> unto his law<S>8451</S>.
Therefore he hath poured<S>8210</S> upon him the fury<S>2534</S> of his anger<S>639</S>, and the strength<S>5807</S> of battle<S>4421</S>: and it hath set him on fire<S>3857</S> round about<S>5439</S>, yet he knew<S>3045</S> not; and it burned<S>1197</S> him, yet he laid<S>7760</S> it not to heart<S>3820</S>.

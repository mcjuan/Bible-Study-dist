A Psalm<S>4210</S> of David<S>1732</S>. LORD<S>3068</S>, who shall abide<S>1481</S> in thy tabernacle<S>168</S>? who shall dwell<S>7931</S> in thy holy<S>6944</S> hill<S>2022</S>? <sup>abide: Heb. sojourn</sup>
He that walketh<S>1980</S> uprightly<S>8549</S>, and worketh<S>6466</S> righteousness<S>6664</S>, and speaketh<S>1696</S> the truth<S>571</S> in his heart<S>3824</S>.
He that backbiteth<S>7270</S> not with his tongue<S>3956</S>, nor doeth<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> to his neighbour<S>7453</S>, nor taketh up<S>5375</S> a reproach<S>2781</S> against his neighbour<S>7138</S>. <sup>taketh: or, receiveth, or, endureth</sup>
In whose eyes<S>5869</S> a vile person<S>3988</S> is contemned<S>959</S>; but he honoureth<S>3513</S> them that fear<S>3373</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. He that sweareth<S>7650</S> to his own hurt<S>7489</S>, and changeth<S>4171</S> not.
He that putteth not out<S>5414</S> his money<S>3701</S> to usury<S>5392</S>, nor taketh<S>3947</S> reward<S>7810</S> against the innocent<S>5355</S>. He that doeth<S>6213</S> these things shall never<S>5769</S> be moved<S>4131</S>.

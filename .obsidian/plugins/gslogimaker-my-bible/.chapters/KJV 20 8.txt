Doth not wisdom<S>2451</S> cry<S>7121</S>? and understanding<S>8394</S> put forth<S>5414</S> her voice<S>6963</S>?
She standeth<S>5324</S> in the top<S>7218</S> of high places<S>4791</S>, by the way<S>1870</S> in the places<S>1004</S> of the paths<S>5410</S>.
She crieth<S>7442</S> at<S>3027</S> the gates<S>8179</S>, at the entry<S>6310</S> of the city<S>7176</S>, at the coming<S>3996</S> in at the doors<S>6607</S>.
Unto you, O men<S>376</S>, I call<S>7121</S>; and my voice<S>6963</S> is to the sons<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>.
O ye simple<S>6612</S>, understand<S>995</S> wisdom<S>6195</S>: and, ye fools<S>3684</S>, be ye of an understanding<S>995</S> heart<S>3820</S>.
Hear<S>8085</S>; for I will speak<S>1696</S> of excellent things<S>5057</S>; and the opening<S>4669</S> of my lips<S>8193</S> shall be right things<S>4339</S>.
For my mouth<S>2441</S> shall speak<S>1897</S> truth<S>571</S>; and wickedness<S>7562</S> is an abomination<S>8441</S> to my lips<S>8193</S>. <sup>an: Heb. the abomination of my lips</sup>
All the words<S>561</S> of my mouth<S>6310</S> are in righteousness<S>6664</S>; there is nothing froward<S>6617</S> or perverse<S>6141</S> in them. <sup>froward: Heb. wreathed</sup>
They are all plain<S>5228</S> to him that understandeth<S>995</S>, and right<S>3477</S> to them that find<S>4672</S> knowledge<S>1847</S>.
Receive<S>3947</S> my instruction<S>4148</S>, and not silver<S>3701</S>; and knowledge<S>1847</S> rather than choice<S>977</S> gold<S>2742</S>.
For wisdom<S>2451</S> is better<S>2896</S> than rubies<S>6443</S>; and all the things that may be desired<S>2656</S> are not to be compared<S>7737</S> to it.
I wisdom<S>2451</S> dwell<S>7931</S> with prudence<S>6195</S>, and find out<S>4672</S> knowledge<S>1847</S> of witty inventions<S>4209</S>. <sup>prudence: or, subtilty</sup>
The fear<S>3374</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is to hate<S>8130</S> evil<S>7451</S>: pride<S>1344</S>, and arrogancy<S>1347</S>, and the evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>, and the froward<S>8419</S> mouth<S>6310</S>, do I hate<S>8130</S>.
Counsel<S>6098</S> is mine, and sound wisdom<S>8454</S>: I am understanding<S>998</S>; I have strength<S>1369</S>.
By me kings<S>4428</S> reign<S>4427</S>, and princes<S>7336</S> decree<S>2710</S> justice<S>6664</S>.
By me princes<S>8269</S> rule<S>8323</S>, and nobles<S>5081</S>, even all the judges<S>8199</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
I love<S>157</S> them that love<S>157</S> me; and those that seek me early<S>7836</S> shall find<S>4672</S> me.
Riches<S>6239</S> and honour<S>3519</S> are with me; yea, durable<S>6276</S> riches<S>1952</S> and righteousness<S>6666</S>.
My fruit<S>6529</S> is better<S>2896</S> than gold<S>2742</S>, yea, than fine gold<S>6337</S>; and my revenue<S>8393</S> than choice<S>977</S> silver<S>3701</S>.
I lead<S>1980</S> in the way<S>734</S> of righteousness<S>6666</S>, in the midst<S>8432</S> of the paths<S>5410</S> of judgment<S>4941</S>: <sup>lead: or, walk</sup>
That I may cause those that love<S>157</S> me to inherit<S>5157</S> substance<S>3426</S>; and I will fill<S>4390</S> their treasures<S>214</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> possessed<S>7069</S> me in the beginning<S>7225</S> of his way<S>1870</S>, before<S>6924</S> his works<S>4659</S> of old.
I was set up<S>5258</S> from everlasting<S>5769</S>, from the beginning<S>7218</S>, or ever<S>6924</S> the earth<S>776</S> was.
When there were no depths<S>8415</S>, I was brought forth<S>2342</S>; when there were no fountains<S>4599</S> abounding<S>3513</S> with water<S>4325</S>.
Before the mountains<S>2022</S> were settled<S>2883</S>, before<S>6440</S> the hills<S>1389</S> was I brought forth<S>2342</S>:
While as yet he had not made<S>6213</S> the earth<S>776</S>, nor the fields<S>2351</S>, nor the highest part<S>7218</S> of the dust<S>6083</S> of the world<S>8398</S>. <sup>fields: or, open places</sup> <sup>the highest: or, the chief part</sup>
When he prepared<S>3559</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>, I was there: when he set<S>2710</S> a compass<S>2329</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the depth<S>8415</S>: <sup>a compass: or, a circle</sup>
When he established<S>553</S> the clouds<S>7834</S> above<S>4605</S>: when he strengthened<S>5810</S> the fountains<S>5869</S> of the deep<S>8415</S>:
When he gave<S>7760</S> to the sea<S>3220</S> his decree<S>2706</S>, that the waters<S>4325</S> should not pass<S>5674</S> his commandment<S>6310</S>: when he appointed<S>2710</S> the foundations<S>4144</S> of the earth<S>776</S>:
Then I was by him<S>681</S>, as one brought up<S>525</S> with him: and I was daily<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S> his delight<S>8191</S>, rejoicing<S>7832</S> always<S>6256</S> before<S>6440</S> him;
Rejoicing<S>7832</S> in the habitable part<S>8398</S> of his earth<S>776</S>; and my delights<S>8191</S> were with the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>.
Now therefore hearken<S>8085</S> unto me, O ye children<S>1121</S>: for blessed<S>835</S> are they that keep<S>8104</S> my ways<S>1870</S>.
Hear<S>8085</S> instruction<S>4148</S>, and be wise<S>2449</S>, and refuse<S>6544</S> it not.
Blessed<S>835</S> is the man<S>120</S> that heareth<S>8085</S> me, watching<S>8245</S> daily<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S> at my gates<S>1817</S>, waiting<S>8104</S> at the posts<S>4201</S> of my doors<S>6607</S>.
For whoso findeth<S>4672</S> me findeth<S>4672</S> <S>4672</S> life<S>2416</S>, and shall obtain<S>6329</S> favour<S>7522</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>obtain: Heb. bring forth</sup>
But he that sinneth<S>2398</S> against me wrongeth<S>2554</S> his own soul<S>5315</S>: all they that hate<S>8130</S> me love<S>157</S> death<S>4194</S>.

If there be a controversy<S>7379</S> between men<S>582</S>, and they come<S>5066</S> unto judgment<S>4941</S>, that the judges may judge<S>8199</S> them; then they shall justify<S>6663</S> the righteous<S>6662</S>, and condemn<S>7561</S> the wicked<S>7563</S>.
And it shall be, if the wicked man<S>7563</S> be worthy<S>1121</S> to be beaten<S>5221</S>, that the judge<S>8199</S> shall cause him to lie down<S>5307</S>, and to be beaten<S>5221</S> before his face<S>6440</S>, according<S>1767</S> to his fault<S>7564</S>, by a certain number<S>4557</S>.
Forty<S>705</S> stripes<S>5221</S> he may give him, and not exceed<S>3254</S>: lest, if he should exceed<S>3254</S>, and beat<S>5221</S> him above these with many<S>7227</S> stripes<S>4347</S>, then thy brother<S>251</S> should seem vile<S>7034</S> <S>5869</S> unto thee.
Thou shalt not muzzle<S>2629</S> the ox<S>7794</S> when he treadeth out<S>1778</S> the corn. <sup>treadeth: Heb. thresheth</sup>
If brethren<S>251</S> dwell<S>3427</S> together<S>3162</S>, and one<S>259</S> of them die<S>4191</S>, and have no child<S>1121</S>, the wife<S>802</S> of the dead<S>4191</S> shall not marry without<S>2351</S> unto a stranger<S>376</S> <S>2114</S>: her husband's brother<S>2993</S> shall go in<S>935</S> unto her, and take<S>3947</S> her to him to wife<S>802</S>, and perform the duty of an husband's brother<S>2992</S> unto her. <sup>her husband's: or, her next kinsman</sup>
And it shall be, that the firstborn<S>1060</S> which she beareth<S>3205</S> shall succeed<S>6965</S> in the name<S>8034</S> of his brother<S>251</S> which is dead<S>4191</S>, that his name<S>8034</S> be not put out<S>4229</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And if the man<S>376</S> like<S>2654</S> not to take<S>3947</S> his brother's wife<S>2994</S>, then let his brother's wife<S>2994</S> go up<S>5927</S> to the gate<S>8179</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S>, and say<S>559</S>, My husband's brother<S>2993</S> refuseth<S>3985</S> to raise up<S>6965</S> unto his brother<S>251</S> a name<S>8034</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, he will<S>14</S> not perform the duty of my husband's brother<S>2992</S>. <sup>brother's: or, next kinsman's</sup>
Then the elders<S>2205</S> of his city<S>5892</S> shall call<S>7121</S> him, and speak<S>1696</S> unto him: and if he stand<S>5975</S> to it, and say<S>559</S>, I like<S>2654</S> not to take<S>3947</S> her;
Then shall his brother's wife<S>2994</S> come<S>5066</S> unto him in the presence<S>5869</S> of the elders<S>2205</S>, and loose<S>2502</S> his shoe<S>5275</S> from off his foot<S>7272</S>, and spit<S>3417</S> in his face<S>6440</S>, and shall answer<S>6030</S> and say<S>559</S>, So shall it be done<S>6213</S> unto that man<S>376</S> that will not build up<S>1129</S> his brother's<S>251</S> house<S>1004</S>.
And his name<S>8034</S> shall be called<S>7121</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, The house<S>1004</S> of him that hath his shoe<S>5275</S> loosed<S>2502</S>.
When men<S>582</S> strive<S>5327</S> together<S>3162</S> one with another<S>251</S> <S>376</S>, and the wife<S>802</S> of the one<S>259</S> draweth near<S>7126</S> for to deliver<S>5337</S> her husband<S>376</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of him that smiteth<S>5221</S> him, and putteth forth<S>7971</S> her hand<S>3027</S>, and taketh<S>2388</S> him by the secrets<S>4016</S>:
Then thou shalt cut off<S>7112</S> her hand<S>3709</S>, thine eye<S>5869</S> shall not pity<S>2347</S> her.
Thou shalt not have in thy bag<S>3599</S> divers weights<S>68</S> <S>68</S>, a great<S>1419</S> and a small<S>6996</S>. <sup>divers: Heb. a stone and a stone</sup>
Thou shalt not have in thine house<S>1004</S> divers measures<S>374</S> <S>374</S>, a great<S>1419</S> and a small<S>6996</S>. <sup>divers: Heb. an ephah and an ephah</sup>
But thou shalt have a perfect<S>8003</S> and just<S>6664</S> weight<S>68</S>, a perfect<S>8003</S> and just<S>6664</S> measure<S>374</S> shalt thou have: that thy days<S>3117</S> may be lengthened<S>748</S> in the land<S>127</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee.
For all that do<S>6213</S> such things<S>428</S>, and all that do<S>6213</S> unrighteously<S>5766</S>, are an abomination<S>8441</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> what Amalek<S>6002</S> did<S>6213</S> unto thee by the way<S>1870</S>, when ye were come forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>;
How he met<S>7136</S> thee by the way<S>1870</S>, and smote the hindmost<S>2179</S> of thee, even all that were feeble<S>2826</S> behind<S>310</S> thee, when thou wast faint<S>5889</S> and weary<S>3023</S>; and he feared<S>3373</S> not God<S>430</S>.
Therefore it shall be, when the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath given thee rest<S>5117</S> from all thine enemies<S>341</S> round about<S>5439</S>, in the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee for an inheritance<S>5159</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it, that thou shalt blot out<S>4229</S> the remembrance<S>2143</S> of Amalek<S>6002</S> from under heaven<S>8064</S>; thou shalt not forget<S>7911</S> it.

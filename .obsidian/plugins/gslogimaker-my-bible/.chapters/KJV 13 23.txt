So when David<S>1732</S> was old<S>2204</S> and full<S>7646</S> of days<S>3117</S>, he made Solomon<S>8010</S> his son<S>1121</S> king<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he gathered together<S>622</S> all the princes<S>8269</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, with the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>.
Now the Levites<S>3881</S> were numbered<S>5608</S> from the age<S>1121</S> of thirty<S>7970</S> years<S>8141</S> and upward<S>4605</S>: and their number<S>4557</S> by their polls<S>1538</S>, man by man<S>1397</S>, was thirty<S>7970</S> and eight<S>8083</S> thousand<S>505</S>.
Of which<S>428</S>, twenty<S>6242</S> and four<S>702</S> thousand<S>505</S> were to set forward<S>5329</S> the work<S>4399</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and six<S>8337</S> thousand<S>505</S> were officers<S>7860</S> and judges<S>8199</S>: <sup>set: or, oversee</sup>
Moreover four<S>702</S> thousand<S>505</S> were porters<S>7778</S>; and four<S>702</S> thousand<S>505</S> praised<S>1984</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with the instruments<S>3627</S> which I made<S>6213</S>, said David, to praise<S>1984</S> therewith.
And David<S>1732</S> divided<S>2505</S> them into courses<S>4256</S> among the sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>, namely, Gershon<S>1648</S>, Kohath<S>6955</S>, and Merari<S>4847</S>. <sup>courses: Heb. divisions</sup>
Of the Gershonites<S>1649</S> were, Laadan<S>3936</S>, and Shimei<S>8096</S>. <sup>Laadan: or, Libni</sup>
The sons<S>1121</S> of Laadan<S>3936</S>; the chief<S>7218</S> was Jehiel<S>3171</S>, and Zetham<S>2241</S>, and Joel<S>3100</S>, three<S>7969</S>.
The sons<S>1121</S> of Shimei<S>8096</S>; Shelomith<S>8019</S> <S>8013</S>, and Haziel<S>2381</S>, and Haran<S>2039</S>, three<S>7969</S>. These were the chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S> of Laadan<S>3936</S>.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Shimei<S>8096</S> were, Jahath<S>3189</S>, Zina<S>2126</S>, and Jeush<S>3266</S>, and Beriah<S>1283</S>. These four<S>702</S> were the sons<S>1121</S> of Shimei<S>8096</S>. <sup>Zina: or, Zizah</sup>
And Jahath<S>3189</S> was the chief<S>7218</S>, and Zizah<S>2125</S> the second<S>8145</S>: but Jeush<S>3266</S> and Beriah<S>1283</S> had not many<S>7235</S> sons<S>1121</S>; therefore they were in one<S>259</S> reckoning<S>6486</S>, according to their father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>. <sup>had: Heb. did not multiply sons</sup>
The sons<S>1121</S> of Kohath<S>6955</S>; Amram<S>6019</S>, Izhar<S>3324</S>, Hebron<S>2275</S>, and Uzziel<S>5816</S>, four<S>702</S>.
The sons<S>1121</S> of Amram<S>6019</S>; Aaron<S>175</S> and Moses<S>4872</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> was separated<S>914</S>, that he should sanctify<S>6942</S> the most<S>6944</S> holy things<S>6944</S>, he and his sons<S>1121</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>, to burn incense<S>6999</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to minister<S>8334</S> unto him, and to bless<S>1288</S> in his name<S>8034</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
Now concerning Moses<S>4872</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, his sons<S>1121</S> were named<S>7121</S> of the tribe<S>7626</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>.
The sons<S>1121</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> were, Gershom<S>1647</S>, and Eliezer<S>461</S>.
Of the sons<S>1121</S> of Gershom<S>1647</S>, Shebuel<S>7619</S> was the chief<S>7218</S>. <sup>Shebuel: or, Shubael</sup>
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Eliezer<S>461</S> were, Rehabiah<S>7345</S> the chief<S>7218</S>. And Eliezer<S>461</S> had none other<S>312</S> sons<S>1121</S>; but the sons<S>1121</S> of Rehabiah<S>7345</S> were very<S>4605</S> many<S>7235</S>. <sup>the chief: or, the first</sup> <sup>very many: Heb. were highly multiplied</sup>
Of the sons<S>1121</S> of Izhar<S>3324</S>; Shelomith<S>8019</S> the chief<S>7218</S>.
Of the sons<S>1121</S> of Hebron<S>2275</S>; Jeriah<S>3404</S> the first<S>7218</S>, Amariah<S>568</S> the second<S>8145</S>, Jahaziel<S>3166</S> the third<S>7992</S>, and Jekameam<S>3360</S> the fourth<S>7243</S>.
Of the sons<S>1121</S> of Uzziel<S>5816</S>; Michah<S>4318</S> the first<S>7218</S>, and Jesiah<S>3449</S> the second<S>8145</S>.
The sons<S>1121</S> of Merari<S>4847</S>; Mahli<S>4249</S>, and Mushi<S>4187</S>. The sons<S>1121</S> of Mahli<S>4249</S>; Eleazar<S>499</S>, and Kish<S>7027</S>.
And Eleazar<S>499</S> died<S>4191</S>, and had no sons<S>1121</S>, but daughters<S>1323</S>: and their brethren<S>251</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Kish<S>7027</S> took<S>5375</S> them. <sup>brethren: or, kinsmen</sup>
The sons<S>1121</S> of Mushi<S>4187</S>; Mahli<S>4249</S>, and Eder<S>5740</S>, and Jeremoth<S>3406</S>, three<S>7969</S>.
These were the sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S> after the house<S>1004</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>; even the chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S>, as they were counted<S>6485</S> by number<S>4557</S> of names<S>8034</S> by their polls<S>1538</S>, that did<S>6213</S> the work<S>4399</S> for the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, from the age<S>1121</S> of twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> and upward<S>4605</S>.
For David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> hath given rest<S>5117</S> unto his people<S>5971</S>, that they may dwell<S>7931</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> for ever<S>5769</S>: <sup>that: or, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem, etc</sup>
And also unto the Levites<S>3881</S>; they shall no more carry<S>5375</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S>, nor any vessels<S>3627</S> of it for the service<S>5656</S> thereof.
For by the last<S>314</S> words<S>1697</S> of David<S>1732</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> were numbered<S>4557</S> from twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> and above<S>4605</S>: <sup>numbered: Heb. number</sup>
Because their office<S>4612</S> was to wait<S>3027</S> on the sons<S>1121</S> of Aaron<S>175</S> for the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, in the courts<S>2691</S>, and in the chambers<S>3957</S>, and in the purifying<S>2893</S> of all holy things<S>6944</S>, and the work<S>4639</S> of the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>; <sup>their: Heb. their station was at the hand of the sons of Aaron</sup>
Both for the shewbread<S>3899</S> <S>4635</S>, and for the fine flour<S>5560</S> for meat offering<S>4503</S>, and for the unleavened<S>4682</S> cakes<S>7550</S>, and for that which is baked in the pan<S>4227</S>, and for that which is fried<S>7246</S>, and for all manner of measure<S>4884</S> and size<S>4060</S>; <sup>pan: or, flat plate</sup>

Then answered<S>6030</S> Bildad<S>1085</S> the Shuhite<S>7747</S>, and said<S>559</S>,
Dominion<S>4910</S> and fear<S>6343</S> are with him, he maketh<S>6213</S> peace<S>7965</S> in his high places<S>4791</S>.
Is there<S>3426</S> any number<S>4557</S> of his armies<S>1416</S>? and upon whom doth not his light<S>216</S> arise<S>6965</S>?
How then can man<S>582</S> be justified<S>6663</S> with God<S>410</S>? or how can he be clean<S>2135</S> that is born<S>3205</S> of a woman<S>802</S>?
Behold even to the moon<S>3394</S>, and it shineth<S>166</S> not; yea, the stars<S>3556</S> are not pure<S>2141</S> in his sight<S>5869</S>.
How much less man<S>582</S>, that is a worm<S>7415</S>? and the son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, which is a worm<S>8438</S>?

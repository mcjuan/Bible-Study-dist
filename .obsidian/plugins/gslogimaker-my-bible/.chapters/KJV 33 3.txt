And I said<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S>, I pray you, O heads<S>7218</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, and ye princes<S>7101</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Is it not for you to know<S>3045</S> judgment<S>4941</S>?
Who hate<S>8130</S> the good<S>2896</S>, and love<S>157</S> the evil<S>7451</S>; who pluck off<S>1497</S> their skin<S>5785</S> from off them, and their flesh<S>7607</S> from off their bones<S>6106</S>;
Who also eat<S>398</S> the flesh<S>7607</S> of my people<S>5971</S>, and flay<S>6584</S> their skin<S>5785</S> from off them; and they break<S>6476</S> their bones<S>6106</S>, and chop them in pieces<S>6566</S>, as for the pot<S>5518</S>, and as flesh<S>1320</S> within<S>8432</S> the caldron<S>7037</S>.
Then shall they cry<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, but he will not hear<S>6030</S> them: he will even hide<S>5641</S> his face<S>6440</S> from them at that time<S>6256</S>, as they have behaved themselves ill<S>7489</S> in their doings<S>4611</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> concerning the prophets<S>5030</S> that make my people<S>5971</S> err<S>8582</S>, that bite<S>5391</S> with their teeth<S>8127</S>, and cry<S>7121</S>, Peace<S>7965</S>; and he that putteth<S>5414</S> not into their mouths<S>6310</S>, they even prepare<S>6942</S> war<S>4421</S> against him.
Therefore night<S>3915</S> shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision<S>2377</S>; and it shall be dark<S>2821</S> <S>2821</S> unto you, that ye shall not divine<S>7080</S>; and the sun<S>8121</S> shall go down<S>935</S> over the prophets<S>5030</S>, and the day<S>3117</S> shall be dark<S>6937</S> over them. <sup>that: vision: Heb. from a vision</sup> <sup>that: divine: Heb. from divining</sup>
Then shall the seers<S>2374</S> be ashamed<S>954</S>, and the diviners<S>7080</S> confounded<S>2659</S>: yea, they shall all cover<S>5844</S> their lips<S>8222</S>; for there is no answer<S>4617</S> of God<S>430</S>. <sup>lips: Heb. upper lip</sup>
But truly<S>199</S> I am full<S>4390</S> of power<S>3581</S> by the spirit<S>7307</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and of judgment<S>4941</S>, and of might<S>1369</S>, to declare<S>5046</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S> his transgression<S>6588</S>, and to Israel<S>3478</S> his sin<S>2403</S>.
Hear<S>8085</S> this, I pray you, ye heads<S>7218</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, and princes<S>7101</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that abhor<S>8581</S> judgment<S>4941</S>, and pervert<S>6140</S> all equity<S>3477</S>.
They build up<S>1129</S> Zion<S>6726</S> with blood<S>1818</S>, and Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with iniquity<S>5766</S>. <sup>blood: Heb. bloods</sup>
The heads<S>7218</S> thereof judge<S>8199</S> for reward<S>7810</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> thereof teach<S>3384</S> for hire<S>4242</S>, and the prophets<S>5030</S> thereof divine<S>7080</S> for money<S>3701</S>: yet will they lean<S>8172</S> upon the LORD<S>3068</S>, and say<S>559</S>, Is not the LORD<S>3068</S> among<S>7130</S> us? none evil<S>7451</S> can come<S>935</S> upon us. <sup>and say: Heb. saying</sup>
Therefore shall Zion<S>6726</S> for your sake<S>1558</S> be plowed<S>2790</S> as a field<S>7704</S>, and Jerusalem<S>3389</S> shall become heaps<S>5856</S>, and the mountain<S>2022</S> of the house<S>1004</S> as the high places<S>1116</S> of the forest<S>3293</S>.

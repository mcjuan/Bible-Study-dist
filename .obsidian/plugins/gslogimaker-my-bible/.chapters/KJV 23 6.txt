In the year<S>8141</S> that king<S>4428</S> Uzziah<S>5818</S> died<S>4194</S> I saw<S>7200</S> also<S>853</S> the Lord<S>136</S> sitting<S>3427</S> upon a throne<S>3678</S>, high<S>7311</S> and lifted up<S>5375</S>, and his train<S>7757</S> filled<S>4392</S> <S>853</S> the temple<S>1964</S>. <sup>his: or, the skirts thereof</sup>
Above<S>4605</S> it stood<S>5975</S> the seraphims<S>8314</S>: each one<S>259</S> had six<S>8337</S> wings<S>3671</S>; with twain<S>8147</S> he covered<S>3680</S> his face<S>6440</S>, and with twain<S>8147</S> he covered<S>3680</S> his feet<S>7272</S>, and with twain<S>8147</S> he did fly<S>5774</S>.
And one cried<S>7121</S> unto another, and said<S>559</S>, Holy<S>6918</S>, holy<S>6918</S>, holy<S>6918</S>, is the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>: the whole earth<S>776</S> is full<S>4393</S> of his glory<S>3519</S>. <sup>one: Heb. this cried to this</sup> <sup>the whole: Heb. his glory is the fulness of the whole earth</sup>
And the posts<S>520</S> of the door<S>5592</S> moved<S>5128</S> at the voice<S>6963</S> of him that cried<S>7121</S>, and the house<S>1004</S> was filled<S>4390</S> with smoke<S>6227</S>. <sup>door: Heb. thresholds</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> I, Woe<S>188</S> is me! for I am undone<S>1820</S>; because I am a man<S>376</S> of unclean<S>2931</S> lips<S>8193</S>, and I dwell<S>3427</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of a people<S>5971</S> of unclean<S>2931</S> lips<S>8193</S>: for mine eyes<S>5869</S> have seen<S>7200</S> the King<S>4428</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>. <sup>undone: Heb. cut off</sup>
Then flew<S>5774</S> one<S>259</S> of the seraphims<S>8314</S> unto me, having a live coal<S>7531</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>, which he had taken<S>3947</S> with the tongs<S>4457</S> from off the altar<S>4196</S>: <sup>having: Heb. and in his hand a live coal</sup>
And he laid<S>5060</S> it upon my mouth<S>6310</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Lo, this hath touched<S>5060</S> thy lips<S>8193</S>; and thine iniquity<S>5771</S> is taken away<S>5493</S>, and thy sin<S>2403</S> purged<S>3722</S>. <sup>laid: Heb. caused it to touch</sup>
Also I heard<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the Lord<S>136</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Whom shall I send<S>7971</S>, and who will go<S>3212</S> for us? Then said<S>559</S> I, Here am I; send<S>7971</S> me. <sup>Here: Heb. behold me</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, and tell<S>559</S> this people<S>5971</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> ye indeed<S>8085</S>, but understand<S>995</S> not; and see<S>7200</S> ye indeed<S>7200</S>, but perceive<S>3045</S> not. <sup>indeed, but understand: or, without ceasing, etc: Heb. in hearing, etc</sup>
Make the heart<S>3820</S> of this people<S>5971</S> fat<S>8080</S>, and make their ears<S>241</S> heavy<S>3513</S>, and shut<S>8173</S> their eyes<S>5869</S>; lest they see<S>7200</S> with their eyes<S>5869</S>, and hear<S>8085</S> with their ears<S>241</S>, and understand<S>995</S> with their heart<S>3824</S>, and convert<S>7725</S>, and be healed<S>7495</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> I, Lord<S>136</S>, how long? And he answered<S>559</S>, Until the cities<S>5892</S> be wasted<S>7582</S> without inhabitant<S>3427</S>, and the houses<S>1004</S> without man<S>120</S>, and the land<S>127</S> be utterly<S>8077</S> desolate<S>7582</S>, <sup>utterly: Heb. desolate with desolation</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> have removed<S>7368</S> men<S>120</S> far away<S>7368</S>, and there be a great<S>7227</S> forsaking<S>5805</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
But yet in it shall be a tenth<S>6224</S>, and it shall return<S>7725</S>, and shall be eaten<S>1197</S>: as a teil tree<S>424</S>, and as an oak<S>437</S>, whose substance<S>4678</S> is in them, when they cast<S>7995</S> their leaves: so the holy<S>6944</S> seed<S>2233</S> shall be the substance<S>4678</S> thereof. <sup>and it: or, when it is returned, and hath been broused</sup> <sup>substance: or, stock, or, stem</sup>

Praise<S>1984</S> ye the LORD<S>3050</S>. O give thanks<S>3034</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; for he is good<S>2896</S>: for his mercy<S>2617</S> endureth for ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>Praise: Heb. Hallelujah</sup>
Who can utter<S>4448</S> the mighty acts<S>1369</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>? who can shew forth<S>8085</S> all his praise<S>8416</S>?
Blessed<S>835</S> are they that keep<S>8104</S> judgment<S>4941</S>, and he that doeth<S>6213</S> righteousness<S>6666</S> at all times<S>6256</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> me, O LORD<S>3068</S>, with the favour<S>7522</S> that thou bearest unto thy people<S>5971</S>: O visit<S>6485</S> me with thy salvation<S>3444</S>;
That I may see<S>7200</S> the good<S>2896</S> of thy chosen<S>972</S>, that I may rejoice<S>8055</S> in the gladness<S>8057</S> of thy nation<S>1471</S>, that I may glory<S>1984</S> with thine inheritance<S>5159</S>.
We have sinned<S>2398</S> with our fathers<S>1</S>, we have committed iniquity<S>5753</S>, we have done wickedly<S>7561</S>.
Our fathers<S>1</S> understood<S>7919</S> not thy wonders<S>6381</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>; they remembered<S>2142</S> not the multitude<S>7230</S> of thy mercies<S>2617</S>; but provoked<S>4784</S> him at the sea<S>3220</S>, even at the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>.
Nevertheless he saved<S>3467</S> them for his name's<S>8034</S> sake, that he might make his mighty power<S>1369</S> to be known<S>3045</S>.
He rebuked<S>1605</S> the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S> also, and it was dried up<S>2717</S>: so he led<S>3212</S> them through the depths<S>8415</S>, as through the wilderness<S>4057</S>.
And he saved<S>3467</S> them from the hand<S>3027</S> of him that hated<S>8130</S> them, and redeemed<S>1350</S> them from the hand<S>3027</S> of the enemy<S>341</S>.
And the waters<S>4325</S> covered<S>3680</S> their enemies<S>6862</S>: there was not one<S>259</S> of them left<S>3498</S>.
Then believed<S>539</S> they his words<S>1697</S>; they sang<S>7891</S> his praise<S>8416</S>.
They soon<S>4116</S> forgat<S>7911</S> his works<S>4639</S>; they waited<S>2442</S> not for his counsel<S>6098</S>: <sup>They soon: Heb. They made haste, they forgat</sup>
But lusted<S>183</S> exceedingly<S>8378</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and tempted<S>5254</S> God<S>410</S> in the desert<S>3452</S>. <sup>lusted: Heb. lusted a lust</sup>
And he gave<S>5414</S> them their request<S>7596</S>; but sent<S>7971</S> leanness<S>7332</S> into their soul<S>5315</S>.
They envied<S>7065</S> Moses<S>4872</S> also in the camp<S>4264</S>, and Aaron<S>175</S> the saint<S>6918</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
The earth<S>776</S> opened<S>6605</S> and swallowed up<S>1104</S> Dathan<S>1885</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> the company<S>5712</S> of Abiram<S>48</S>.
And a fire<S>784</S> was kindled<S>1197</S> in their company<S>5712</S>; the flame<S>3852</S> burned up<S>3857</S> the wicked<S>7563</S>.
They made<S>6213</S> a calf<S>5695</S> in Horeb<S>2722</S>, and worshipped<S>7812</S> the molten image<S>4541</S>.
Thus they changed<S>4171</S> their glory<S>3519</S> into the similitude<S>8403</S> of an ox<S>7794</S> that eateth<S>398</S> grass<S>6212</S>.
They forgat<S>7911</S> God<S>410</S> their saviour<S>3467</S>, which had done<S>6213</S> great things<S>1419</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>;
Wondrous works<S>6381</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Ham<S>2526</S>, and terrible things<S>3372</S> by the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>.
Therefore he said<S>559</S> that he would destroy<S>8045</S> them, had not<S>3884</S> Moses<S>4872</S> his chosen<S>972</S> stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him in the breach<S>6556</S>, to turn away<S>7725</S> his wrath<S>2534</S>, lest he should destroy<S>7843</S> them.
Yea, they despised<S>3988</S> the pleasant<S>2532</S> land<S>776</S>, they believed<S>539</S> not his word<S>1697</S>: <sup>the pleasant: Heb. a land of desire</sup>
But murmured<S>7279</S> in their tents<S>168</S>, and hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Therefore he lifted up<S>5375</S> his hand<S>3027</S> against them, to overthrow<S>5307</S> them in the wilderness<S>4057</S>: <sup>to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall</sup>
To overthrow<S>5307</S> their seed<S>2233</S> also among the nations<S>1471</S>, and to scatter<S>2219</S> them in the lands<S>776</S>. <sup>to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall</sup>
They joined<S>6775</S> themselves also unto Baalpeor<S>1187</S>, and ate<S>398</S> the sacrifices<S>2077</S> of the dead<S>4191</S>.
Thus they provoked him to anger<S>3707</S> with their inventions<S>4611</S>: and the plague<S>4046</S> brake in<S>6555</S> upon them.
Then stood up<S>5975</S> Phinehas<S>6372</S>, and executed judgment<S>6419</S>: and so the plague<S>4046</S> was stayed<S>6113</S>.
And that was counted<S>2803</S> unto him for righteousness<S>6666</S> unto all<S>1755</S> generations<S>1755</S> for<S>5704</S> evermore<S>5769</S>.
They angered<S>7107</S> him also at the waters<S>4325</S> of strife<S>4808</S> <S>4809</S>, so that it went ill<S>3415</S> with Moses<S>4872</S> for their sakes:
Because they provoked<S>4784</S> his spirit<S>7307</S>, so that he spake unadvisedly<S>981</S> with his lips<S>8193</S>.
They did not destroy<S>8045</S> the nations<S>5971</S>, concerning whom the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>559</S> them:
But were mingled<S>6148</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, and learned<S>3925</S> their works<S>4639</S>.
And they served<S>5647</S> their idols<S>6091</S>: which were a snare<S>4170</S> unto them.
Yea, they sacrificed<S>2076</S> their sons<S>1121</S> and their daughters<S>1323</S> unto devils<S>7700</S>,
And shed<S>8210</S> innocent<S>5355</S> blood<S>1818</S>, even the blood<S>1818</S> of their sons<S>1121</S> and of their daughters<S>1323</S>, whom they sacrificed<S>2076</S> unto the idols<S>6091</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>: and the land<S>776</S> was polluted<S>2610</S> with blood<S>1818</S>.
Thus were they defiled<S>2930</S> with their own works<S>4639</S>, and went a whoring<S>2181</S> with their own inventions<S>4611</S>.
Therefore was the wrath<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> kindled<S>2734</S> against his people<S>5971</S>, insomuch that he abhorred<S>8581</S> his own inheritance<S>5159</S>.
And he gave<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>; and they that hated<S>8130</S> them ruled<S>4910</S> over them.
Their enemies<S>341</S> also oppressed<S>3905</S> them, and they were brought into subjection<S>3665</S> under their hand<S>3027</S>.
Many<S>7227</S> times<S>6471</S> did he deliver<S>5337</S> them; but they provoked<S>4784</S> him with their counsel<S>6098</S>, and were brought low<S>4355</S> for their iniquity<S>5771</S>. <sup>brought: or, impoverished, or, weakened</sup>
Nevertheless he regarded<S>7200</S> their affliction<S>6862</S>, when he heard<S>8085</S> their cry<S>7440</S>:
And he remembered<S>2142</S> for them his covenant<S>1285</S>, and repented<S>5162</S> according to the multitude<S>7230</S> of his mercies<S>2617</S>.
He made<S>5414</S> them also to be pitied<S>7356</S> of<S>6440</S> all those that carried them captives<S>7617</S>.
Save<S>3467</S> us, O LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, and gather<S>6908</S> us from among the heathen<S>1471</S>, to give thanks<S>3034</S> unto thy holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>, and to triumph<S>7623</S> in thy praise<S>8416</S>.
Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> from everlasting<S>5769</S> to everlasting<S>5769</S>: and let all the people<S>5971</S> say<S>559</S>, Amen<S>543</S>. Praise<S>1984</S> ye the LORD<S>3050</S>. <sup>Praise: Heb. Hallelujah</sup>

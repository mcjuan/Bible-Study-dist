And Joshua<S>3091</S> gathered<S>622</S> all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to Shechem<S>7927</S>, and called<S>7121</S> for the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and for their heads<S>7218</S>, and for their judges<S>8199</S>, and for their officers<S>7860</S>; and they presented<S>3320</S> themselves before<S>6440</S> God<S>430</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Your fathers<S>1</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> on the other side<S>5676</S> of the flood<S>5104</S> in old time<S>5769</S>, even Terah<S>8646</S>, the father<S>1</S> of Abraham<S>85</S>, and the father<S>1</S> of Nachor<S>5152</S>: and they served<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>.
And I took<S>3947</S> your father<S>1</S> Abraham<S>85</S> from the other side<S>5676</S> of the flood<S>5104</S>, and led<S>3212</S> him throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and multiplied<S>7235</S> his seed<S>2233</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> him Isaac<S>3327</S>.
And I gave<S>5414</S> unto Isaac<S>3327</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> and Esau<S>6215</S>: and I gave<S>5414</S> unto Esau<S>6215</S> mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S>, to possess<S>3423</S> it; but Jacob<S>3290</S> and his children<S>1121</S> went down<S>3381</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>.
I sent<S>7971</S> Moses<S>4872</S> also and Aaron<S>175</S>, and I plagued<S>5062</S> Egypt<S>4714</S>, according to that which<S>834</S> I did<S>6213</S> among<S>7130</S> them: and afterward<S>310</S> I brought you out<S>3318</S>.
And I brought<S>3318</S> your fathers<S>1</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>: and ye came<S>935</S> unto the sea<S>3220</S>; and the Egyptians<S>4714</S> pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> your fathers<S>1</S> with chariots<S>7393</S> and horsemen<S>6571</S> unto the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>.
And when they cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, he put<S>7760</S> darkness<S>3990</S> between you and the Egyptians<S>4713</S>, and brought<S>935</S> the sea<S>3220</S> upon them, and covered<S>3680</S> them; and your eyes<S>5869</S> have seen<S>7200</S> what I have done<S>6213</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>: and ye dwelt<S>3427</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> a long<S>7227</S> season<S>3117</S>.
And I brought<S>935</S> you into the land<S>776</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> on the other side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>; and they fought<S>3898</S> with you: and I gave<S>5414</S> them into your hand<S>3027</S>, that ye might possess<S>3423</S> their land<S>776</S>; and I destroyed<S>8045</S> them from before<S>6440</S> you.
Then Balak<S>1111</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zippor<S>6834</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, arose<S>6965</S> and warred<S>3898</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> Balaam<S>1109</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Beor<S>1160</S> to curse<S>7043</S> you:
But I would<S>14</S> not hearken<S>8085</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>; therefore he blessed<S>1288</S> you still<S>1288</S>: so I delivered<S>5337</S> you out of his hand<S>3027</S>.
And ye went over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto Jericho<S>3405</S>: and the men<S>1167</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S> fought<S>3898</S> against you, the Amorites<S>567</S>, and the Perizzites<S>6522</S>, and the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, and the Hittites<S>2850</S>, and the Girgashites<S>1622</S>, the Hivites<S>2340</S>, and the Jebusites<S>2983</S>; and I delivered<S>5414</S> them into your hand<S>3027</S>.
And I sent<S>7971</S> the hornet<S>6880</S> before<S>6440</S> you, which drave them out<S>1644</S> from before<S>6440</S> you, even the two<S>8147</S> kings<S>4428</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>; but not with thy sword<S>2719</S>, nor with thy bow<S>7198</S>.
And I have given<S>5414</S> you a land<S>776</S> for which ye did not labour<S>3021</S>, and cities<S>5892</S> which ye built<S>1129</S> not, and ye dwell<S>3427</S> in them; of the vineyards<S>3754</S> and oliveyards<S>2132</S> which ye planted<S>5193</S> not do ye eat<S>398</S>.
Now therefore fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> him in sincerity<S>8549</S> and in truth<S>571</S>: and put away<S>5493</S> the gods<S>430</S> which your fathers<S>1</S> served<S>5647</S> on the other side<S>5676</S> of the flood<S>5104</S>, and in Egypt<S>4714</S>; and serve<S>5647</S> ye the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And if it seem evil<S>7489</S> unto you<S>4310</S> to serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, choose<S>977</S> you this day<S>3117</S> whom<S>5869</S> ye will serve<S>5647</S>; whether the gods<S>430</S> which your fathers<S>1</S> served<S>5647</S> that were on the other side<S>5676</S> of the flood<S>5104</S>, or the gods<S>430</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, in whose land<S>776</S> ye dwell<S>3427</S>: but as for me and my house<S>1004</S>, we will serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the people<S>5971</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, God forbid<S>2486</S> that we should forsake<S>5800</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to serve<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>;
For the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, he it is that brought us up<S>5927</S> and our fathers<S>1</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, from the house<S>1004</S> of bondage<S>5650</S>, and which did<S>6213</S> those great<S>1419</S> signs<S>226</S> in our sight<S>5869</S>, and preserved<S>8104</S> us in all the way<S>1870</S> wherein we went<S>1980</S>, and among all the people<S>5971</S> through<S>7130</S> whom we passed<S>5674</S>:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> drave out<S>1644</S> from before<S>6440</S> us all the people<S>5971</S>, even the Amorites<S>567</S> which dwelt<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S>: therefore will we also serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; for he is our God<S>430</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Ye cannot<S>3201</S> serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: for he is an holy<S>6918</S> God<S>430</S>; he is a jealous<S>7072</S> God<S>410</S>; he will not forgive<S>5375</S> your transgressions<S>6588</S> nor your sins<S>2403</S>.
If ye forsake<S>5800</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> strange<S>5236</S> gods<S>430</S>, then he will turn<S>7725</S> and do you hurt<S>7489</S>, and consume<S>3615</S> you, after<S>310</S> that he hath done you good<S>3190</S>.
And the people<S>5971</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Nay; but we will serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Ye are witnesses<S>5707</S> against yourselves that ye have chosen<S>977</S> you the LORD<S>3068</S>, to serve<S>5647</S> him. And they said<S>559</S>, We are witnesses<S>5707</S>.
Now therefore put away<S>5493</S>, said he, the strange<S>5236</S> gods<S>430</S> which are among<S>7130</S> you, and incline<S>5186</S> your heart<S>3824</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the people<S>5971</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> will we serve<S>5647</S>, and his voice<S>6963</S> will we obey<S>8085</S>.
So Joshua<S>3091</S> made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with the people<S>5971</S> that day<S>3117</S>, and set<S>7760</S> them a statute<S>2706</S> and an ordinance<S>4941</S> in Shechem<S>7927</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> wrote<S>3789</S> these words<S>1697</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S> of God<S>430</S>, and took<S>3947</S> a great<S>1419</S> stone<S>68</S>, and set it up<S>6965</S> there under an oak<S>427</S>, that was by the sanctuary<S>4720</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S>, Behold, this stone<S>68</S> shall be a witness<S>5713</S> unto us; for it hath heard<S>8085</S> all the words<S>561</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> which he spake<S>1696</S> unto us: it shall be therefore a witness<S>5713</S> unto you, lest ye deny<S>3584</S> your God<S>430</S>.
So Joshua<S>3091</S> let the people<S>5971</S> depart<S>7971</S>, every man<S>376</S> unto his inheritance<S>5159</S>.
And it came to pass after<S>310</S> these things<S>1697</S>, that Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S>, the servant<S>5650</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, died<S>4191</S>, being an hundred<S>3967</S> and ten<S>6235</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>.
And they buried<S>6912</S> him in the border<S>1366</S> of his inheritance<S>5159</S> in Timnathserah<S>8556</S>, which is in mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, on the north side<S>6828</S> of the hill<S>2022</S> of Gaash<S>1608</S>.
And Israel<S>3478</S> served<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of Joshua<S>3091</S>, and all the days<S>3117</S> of the elders<S>2205</S> that overlived<S>748</S> <S>3117</S> <S>310</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>, and which had known<S>3045</S> all the works<S>4639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that he had done<S>6213</S> for Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>overlived: Heb. prolonged their days after Joshua</sup>
And the bones<S>6106</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, which the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> brought up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, buried<S>6912</S> they in Shechem<S>7927</S>, in a parcel<S>2513</S> of ground<S>7704</S> which Jacob<S>3290</S> bought<S>7069</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Hamor<S>2544</S> the father<S>1</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> for an hundred<S>3967</S> pieces of silver<S>7192</S>: and it became the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>. <sup>pieces: or, lambs</sup>
And Eleazar<S>499</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Aaron<S>175</S> died<S>4191</S>; and they buried<S>6912</S> him in a hill<S>1389</S> that pertained to Phinehas<S>6372</S> his son<S>1121</S>, which was given<S>5414</S> him in mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>.

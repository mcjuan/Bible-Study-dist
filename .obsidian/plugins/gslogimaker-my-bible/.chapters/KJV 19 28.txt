A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>. Unto thee will I cry<S>7121</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> my rock<S>6697</S>; be not silent<S>2814</S> to me: lest, if thou be silent<S>2790</S> to me, I become<S>4911</S> like them that go down<S>3381</S> into the pit<S>953</S>. <sup>to me: Heb. from me</sup>
Hear<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of my supplications<S>8469</S>, when I cry<S>7768</S> unto thee, when I lift up<S>5375</S> my hands<S>3027</S> toward thy holy<S>6944</S> oracle<S>1687</S>. <sup>thy: or, the oracle of thy sanctuary</sup>
Draw me not away<S>4900</S> with the wicked<S>7563</S>, and with the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S>, which speak<S>1696</S> peace<S>7965</S> to their neighbours<S>7453</S>, but mischief<S>7451</S> is in their hearts<S>3824</S>.
Give<S>5414</S> them according to their deeds<S>6467</S>, and according to the wickedness<S>7455</S> of their endeavours<S>4611</S>: give<S>5414</S> them after the work<S>4639</S> of their hands<S>3027</S>; render<S>7725</S> to them their desert<S>1576</S>.
Because they regard<S>995</S> not the works<S>6468</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, nor the operation<S>4639</S> of his hands<S>3027</S>, he shall destroy<S>2040</S> them, and not build them up<S>1129</S>.
Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S>, because he hath heard<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of my supplications<S>8469</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is my strength<S>5797</S> and my shield<S>4043</S>; my heart<S>3820</S> trusted<S>982</S> in him, and I am helped<S>5826</S>: therefore my heart<S>3820</S> greatly rejoiceth<S>5937</S>; and with my song<S>7892</S> will I praise<S>3034</S> him.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is their strength<S>5797</S>, and he is the saving<S>3444</S> strength<S>4581</S> of his anointed<S>4899</S>. <sup>their: or, his</sup> <sup>saving: Heb. strength of salvations</sup>
Save<S>3467</S> thy people<S>5971</S>, and bless<S>1288</S> thine inheritance<S>5159</S>: feed<S>7462</S> them also, and lift them up<S>5375</S> for ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>feed: or, rule</sup>

And it came to pass after<S>310</S> these things<S>1697</S>, that Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S> had a vineyard<S>3754</S>, which was in Jezreel<S>3157</S>, hard by<S>681</S> the palace<S>1964</S> of Ahab<S>256</S> king<S>4428</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>.
And Ahab<S>256</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Naboth<S>5022</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> me thy vineyard<S>3754</S>, that I may have it for a garden<S>1588</S> of herbs<S>3419</S>, because it is near<S>7138</S> unto<S>681</S> my house<S>1004</S>: and I will give<S>5414</S> thee for it a better<S>2896</S> vineyard<S>3754</S> than it; or, if it seem good<S>2896</S> to thee<S>5869</S>, I will give<S>5414</S> thee the worth<S>4242</S> of it in money<S>3701</S>. <sup>seem: Heb. be good in thine eyes</sup>
And Naboth<S>5022</S> said<S>559</S> to Ahab<S>256</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> forbid<S>2486</S> it me, that I should give<S>5414</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> of my fathers<S>1</S> unto thee.
And Ahab<S>256</S> came<S>935</S> into his house<S>1004</S> heavy<S>5620</S> and displeased<S>2198</S> because of the word<S>1697</S> which Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S> had spoken<S>1696</S> to him: for he had said<S>559</S>, I will not give<S>5414</S> thee the inheritance<S>5159</S> of my fathers<S>1</S>. And he laid him down<S>7901</S> upon his bed<S>4296</S>, and turned away<S>5437</S> his face<S>6440</S>, and would eat<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S>.
But Jezebel<S>348</S> his wife<S>802</S> came<S>935</S> to him, and said<S>1696</S> unto him, Why is thy spirit<S>7307</S> so sad<S>5620</S>, that thou eatest<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S>?
And he said<S>1696</S> unto her, Because I spake<S>1696</S> unto Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Give<S>5414</S> me thy vineyard<S>3754</S> for money<S>3701</S>; or else, if it please<S>2655</S> thee, I will give<S>5414</S> thee another vineyard<S>3754</S> for it: and he answered<S>559</S>, I will not give<S>5414</S> thee my vineyard<S>3754</S>.
And Jezebel<S>348</S> his wife<S>802</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Dost thou now govern<S>6213</S> the kingdom<S>4410</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>? arise<S>6965</S>, and eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, and let thine heart<S>3820</S> be merry<S>3190</S>: I will give<S>5414</S> thee the vineyard<S>3754</S> of Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S>.
So she wrote<S>3789</S> letters<S>5612</S> in Ahab's<S>256</S> name<S>8034</S>, and sealed<S>2856</S> them with his seal<S>2368</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> the letters<S>5612</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S> and to the nobles<S>2715</S> that were in his city<S>5892</S>, dwelling<S>3427</S> with Naboth<S>5022</S>.
And she wrote<S>3789</S> in the letters<S>5612</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Proclaim<S>7121</S> a fast<S>6685</S>, and set<S>3427</S> Naboth<S>5022</S> on high<S>7218</S> among the people<S>5971</S>: <sup>on high: Heb. in the top of the people</sup>
And set<S>3427</S> two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S>, sons<S>1121</S> of Belial<S>1100</S>, before him, to bear witness<S>5749</S> against him, saying<S>559</S>, Thou didst blaspheme<S>1288</S> God<S>430</S> and the king<S>4428</S>. And then carry him out<S>3318</S>, and stone<S>5619</S> him, that he may die<S>4191</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> of his city<S>5892</S>, even the elders<S>2205</S> and the nobles<S>2715</S> who were the inhabitants<S>3427</S> in his city<S>5892</S>, did<S>6213</S> as Jezebel<S>348</S> had sent<S>7971</S> unto them, and as it was written<S>3789</S> in the letters<S>5612</S> which she had sent<S>7971</S> unto them.
They proclaimed<S>7121</S> a fast<S>6685</S>, and set<S>3427</S> Naboth<S>5022</S> on high<S>7218</S> among the people<S>5971</S>.
And there came<S>935</S> in two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S>, children<S>1121</S> of Belial<S>1100</S>, and sat<S>3427</S> before him: and the men<S>582</S> of Belial<S>1100</S> witnessed<S>5749</S> against him, even against Naboth<S>5022</S>, in the presence of the people<S>5971</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Naboth<S>5022</S> did blaspheme<S>1288</S> God<S>430</S> and the king<S>4428</S>. Then they carried him forth<S>3318</S> out<S>2351</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and stoned<S>5619</S> him with stones<S>68</S>, that he died<S>4191</S>.
Then they sent<S>7971</S> to Jezebel<S>348</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Naboth<S>5022</S> is stoned<S>5619</S>, and is dead<S>4191</S>.
And it came to pass, when Jezebel<S>348</S> heard<S>8085</S> that Naboth<S>5022</S> was stoned<S>5619</S>, and was dead<S>4191</S>, that Jezebel<S>348</S> said<S>559</S> to Ahab<S>256</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, take possession<S>3423</S> of the vineyard<S>3754</S> of Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S>, which he refused<S>3985</S> to give<S>5414</S> thee for money<S>3701</S>: for Naboth<S>5022</S> is not alive<S>2416</S>, but dead<S>4191</S>.
And it came to pass, when Ahab<S>256</S> heard<S>8085</S> that Naboth<S>5022</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, that Ahab<S>256</S> rose up<S>6965</S> to go down<S>3381</S> to the vineyard<S>3754</S> of Naboth<S>5022</S> the Jezreelite<S>3158</S>, to take possession<S>3423</S> of it.
And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came to Elijah<S>452</S> the Tishbite<S>8664</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Arise<S>6965</S>, go down<S>3381</S> to meet<S>7125</S> Ahab<S>256</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which is in Samaria<S>8111</S>: behold, he is in the vineyard<S>3754</S> of Naboth<S>5022</S>, whither he is gone down<S>3381</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it.
And thou shalt speak<S>1696</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Hast thou killed<S>7523</S>, and also taken possession<S>3423</S>? And thou shalt speak<S>1696</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, In the place<S>4725</S> where dogs<S>3611</S> licked<S>3952</S> the blood<S>1818</S> of Naboth<S>5022</S> shall dogs<S>3611</S> lick<S>3952</S> thy blood<S>1818</S>, even thine.
And Ahab<S>256</S> said<S>559</S> to Elijah<S>452</S>, Hast thou found<S>4672</S> me, O mine enemy<S>341</S>? And he answered<S>559</S>, I have found<S>4672</S> thee: because thou hast sold<S>4376</S> thyself to work<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Behold, I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon thee, and will take away<S>1197</S> thy posterity<S>310</S>, and will cut off<S>3772</S> from Ahab<S>256</S> him that pisseth<S>8366</S> against the wall<S>7023</S>, and him that is shut up<S>6113</S> and left<S>5800</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>,
And will make<S>5414</S> thine house<S>1004</S> like the house<S>1004</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S>, and like the house<S>1004</S> of Baasha<S>1201</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahijah<S>281</S>, for the provocation<S>3708</S> wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger<S>3707</S>, and made Israel<S>3478</S> to sin<S>2398</S>.
And of Jezebel<S>348</S> also spake<S>1696</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The dogs<S>3611</S> shall eat<S>398</S> Jezebel<S>348</S> by the wall<S>2426</S> of Jezreel<S>3157</S>. <sup>wall: or, ditch</sup>
Him that dieth<S>4191</S> of Ahab<S>256</S> in the city<S>5892</S> the dogs<S>3611</S> shall eat<S>398</S>; and him that dieth<S>4191</S> in the field<S>7704</S> shall the fowls<S>5775</S> of the air<S>8064</S> eat<S>398</S>.
But there was none like unto Ahab<S>256</S>, which did sell<S>4376</S> himself to work<S>6213</S> wickedness<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, whom Jezebel<S>348</S> his wife<S>802</S> stirred up<S>5496</S>. <sup>stirred: or, incited</sup>
And he did very<S>3966</S> abominably<S>8581</S> in following<S>3212</S> <S>310</S> idols<S>1544</S>, according to all things as did<S>6213</S> the Amorites<S>567</S>, whom the LORD<S>3068</S> cast out<S>3423</S> before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And it came to pass, when Ahab<S>256</S> heard<S>8085</S> those words<S>1697</S>, that he rent<S>7167</S> his clothes<S>899</S>, and put<S>7760</S> sackcloth<S>8242</S> upon his flesh<S>1320</S>, and fasted<S>6684</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> in sackcloth<S>8242</S>, and went<S>1980</S> softly<S>328</S>.
And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came to Elijah<S>452</S> the Tishbite<S>8664</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Seest<S>7200</S> thou how Ahab<S>256</S> humbleth<S>3665</S> himself before<S>6440</S> me? because<S>3282</S> he humbleth<S>3665</S> himself before<S>6440</S> me, I will not bring<S>935</S> the evil<S>7451</S> in his days<S>3117</S>: but in his son's<S>1121</S> days<S>3117</S> will I bring<S>935</S> the evil<S>7451</S> upon his house<S>1004</S>.

Awake<S>5782</S>, awake<S>5782</S>; put on<S>3847</S> thy strength<S>5797</S>, O Zion<S>6726</S>; put on<S>3847</S> thy beautiful<S>8597</S> garments<S>899</S>, O Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, the holy<S>6944</S> city<S>5892</S>: for henceforth there shall no more<S>3254</S> come<S>935</S> into thee the uncircumcised<S>6189</S> and the unclean<S>2931</S>.
Shake<S>5287</S> thyself from the dust<S>6083</S>; arise<S>6965</S>, and sit down<S>3427</S>, O Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: loose<S>6605</S> thyself from the bands<S>4147</S> of thy neck<S>6677</S>, O captive<S>7628</S> daughter<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Ye have sold<S>4376</S> yourselves for nought<S>2600</S>; and ye shall be redeemed<S>1350</S> without money<S>3701</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, My people<S>5971</S> went down<S>3381</S> aforetime<S>7223</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> there; and the Assyrian<S>804</S> oppressed<S>6231</S> them without cause<S>657</S>.
Now therefore, what have I here, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that my people<S>5971</S> is taken away<S>3947</S> for nought<S>2600</S>? they that rule<S>4910</S> over them make them to howl<S>3213</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; and my name<S>8034</S> continually<S>8548</S> every day<S>3117</S> is blasphemed<S>5006</S>.
Therefore my people<S>5971</S> shall know<S>3045</S> my name<S>8034</S>: therefore they shall know in that day<S>3117</S> that I am he that doth speak<S>1696</S>: behold, it is I.
How beautiful<S>4998</S> upon the mountains<S>2022</S> are the feet<S>7272</S> of him that bringeth good tidings<S>1319</S>, that publisheth<S>8085</S> peace<S>7965</S>; that bringeth good tidings<S>1319</S> of good<S>2896</S>, that publisheth<S>8085</S> salvation<S>3444</S>; that saith<S>559</S> unto Zion<S>6726</S>, Thy God<S>430</S> reigneth<S>4427</S>!
Thy watchmen<S>6822</S> shall lift up<S>5375</S> the voice<S>6963</S>; with the voice<S>6963</S> together<S>3162</S> shall they sing<S>7442</S>: for they shall see<S>7200</S> eye<S>5869</S> to eye<S>5869</S>, when the LORD<S>3068</S> shall bring again<S>7725</S> Zion<S>6726</S>.
Break forth into joy<S>6476</S>, sing<S>7442</S> together<S>3162</S>, ye waste places<S>2723</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath comforted<S>5162</S> his people<S>5971</S>, he hath redeemed<S>1350</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> hath made bare<S>2834</S> his holy<S>6944</S> arm<S>2220</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of all the nations<S>1471</S>; and all the ends<S>657</S> of the earth<S>776</S> shall see<S>7200</S> the salvation<S>3444</S> of our God<S>430</S>.
Depart<S>5493</S> ye, depart<S>5493</S> ye, go ye out<S>3318</S> from thence, touch<S>5060</S> no unclean<S>2931</S> thing; go ye out<S>3318</S> of the midst<S>8432</S> of her; be ye clean<S>1305</S>, that bear<S>5375</S> the vessels<S>3627</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
For ye shall not go out<S>3318</S> with haste<S>2649</S>, nor go<S>3212</S> by flight<S>4499</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> will go<S>1980</S> before<S>6440</S> you; and the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> will be your rereward<S>622</S>. <sup>be: Heb. gather you up</sup>
Behold, my servant<S>5650</S> shall deal prudently<S>7919</S>, he shall be exalted<S>7311</S> and extolled<S>5375</S>, and be very<S>3966</S> high<S>1361</S>. <sup>deal: or, prosper</sup>
As many<S>7227</S> were astonied<S>8074</S> at thee; his visage<S>4758</S> was so marred<S>4893</S> more than any man<S>376</S>, and his form<S>8389</S> more than the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>:
So shall he sprinkle<S>5137</S> many<S>7227</S> nations<S>1471</S>; the kings<S>4428</S> shall shut<S>7092</S> their mouths<S>6310</S> at him: for that which had not been told<S>5608</S> them shall they see<S>7200</S>; and that which they had not heard<S>8085</S> shall they consider<S>995</S>.

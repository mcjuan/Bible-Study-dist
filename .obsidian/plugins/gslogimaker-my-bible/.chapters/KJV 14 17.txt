And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead, and strengthened<S>2388</S> himself against Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he placed<S>5414</S> forces<S>2428</S> in all the fenced<S>1219</S> cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and set<S>5414</S> garrisons<S>5333</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the cities<S>5892</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, which Asa<S>609</S> his father<S>1</S> had taken<S>3920</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was with Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, because he walked<S>1980</S> in the first<S>7223</S> ways<S>1870</S> of his father<S>1</S> David<S>1732</S>, and sought<S>1875</S> not unto Baalim<S>1168</S>; <sup>of: or, of his father, and of David</sup>
But sought<S>1875</S> to the LORD God<S>430</S> of his father<S>1</S>, and walked<S>1980</S> in his commandments<S>4687</S>, and not after the doings<S>4639</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
Therefore the LORD<S>3068</S> stablished<S>3559</S> the kingdom<S>4467</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>; and all Judah<S>3063</S> brought<S>5414</S> to Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> presents<S>4503</S>; and he had riches<S>6239</S> and honour<S>3519</S> in abundance<S>7230</S>. <sup>brought: Heb. gave</sup>
And his heart<S>3820</S> was lifted up<S>1361</S> in the ways<S>1870</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: moreover he took away<S>5493</S> the high places<S>1116</S> and groves<S>842</S> out of Judah<S>3063</S>. <sup>was: that is, was encouraged</sup>
Also in the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of his reign<S>4427</S> he sent<S>7971</S> to his princes<S>8269</S>, even to Benhail<S>1134</S>, and to Obadiah<S>5662</S>, and to Zechariah<S>2148</S>, and to Nethaneel<S>5417</S>, and to Michaiah<S>4322</S>, to teach<S>3925</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
And with them he sent Levites<S>3881</S>, even Shemaiah<S>8098</S>, and Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and Zebadiah<S>2069</S>, and Asahel<S>6214</S>, and Shemiramoth<S>8070</S>, and Jehonathan<S>3083</S>, and Adonijah<S>138</S>, and Tobijah<S>2900</S>, and Tobadonijah<S>2899</S>, Levites<S>3881</S>; and with them Elishama<S>476</S> and Jehoram<S>3088</S>, priests<S>3548</S>.
And they taught<S>3925</S> in Judah<S>3063</S>, and had the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> with them, and went about<S>5437</S> throughout all the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and taught<S>3925</S> the people<S>5971</S>.
And the fear<S>6343</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> fell upon all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the lands<S>776</S> that were round about<S>5439</S> Judah<S>3063</S>, so that they made no war<S>3898</S> against Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>. <sup>fell: Heb. was</sup>
Also some of the Philistines<S>6430</S> brought<S>935</S> Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> presents<S>4503</S>, and tribute<S>4853</S> silver<S>3701</S>; and the Arabians<S>6163</S> brought<S>935</S> him flocks<S>6629</S>, seven<S>7651</S> thousand<S>505</S> and seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> rams<S>352</S>, and seven<S>7651</S> thousand<S>505</S> and seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> he goats<S>8495</S>.
And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> waxed<S>1980</S> great<S>1432</S> exceedingly<S>4605</S>; and he built<S>1129</S> in Judah<S>3063</S> castles<S>1003</S>, and cities<S>5892</S> of store<S>4543</S>. <sup>castles: or, palaces</sup>
And he had much<S>7227</S> business<S>4399</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>: and the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, mighty men<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S>, were in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And these are the numbers<S>6486</S> of them according to the house<S>1004</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>: Of Judah<S>3063</S>, the captains<S>8269</S> of thousands<S>505</S>; Adnah<S>5734</S> the chief<S>8269</S>, and with him mighty men<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S> three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S>.
And next<S>3027</S> to him was Jehohanan<S>3076</S> the captain<S>8269</S>, and with him two hundred<S>3967</S> and fourscore<S>8084</S> thousand<S>505</S>. <sup>next: Heb. at his hand</sup>
And next<S>3027</S> him was Amasiah<S>6007</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zichri<S>2147</S>, who willingly offered<S>5068</S> himself unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; and with him two hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> mighty men<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S>.
And of Benjamin<S>1144</S>; Eliada<S>450</S> a mighty man<S>1368</S> of valour<S>2428</S>, and with him armed men<S>5401</S> with bow<S>7198</S> and shield<S>4043</S> two hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S>.
And next<S>3027</S> him was Jehozabad<S>3075</S>, and with him an hundred<S>3967</S> and fourscore<S>8084</S> thousand<S>505</S> ready prepared<S>2502</S> for the war<S>6635</S>.
These waited<S>8334</S> on the king<S>4428</S>, beside those whom the king<S>4428</S> put<S>5414</S> in the fenced<S>4013</S> cities<S>5892</S> throughout all Judah<S>3063</S>.

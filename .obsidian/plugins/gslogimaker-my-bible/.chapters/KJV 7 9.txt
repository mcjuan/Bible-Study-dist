And Abimelech<S>40</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S> went<S>3212</S> to Shechem<S>7927</S> unto his mother's<S>517</S> brethren<S>251</S>, and communed<S>1696</S> with them, and with all the family<S>4940</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of his mother's<S>517</S> father<S>1</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>1696</S>, I pray you, in the ears<S>241</S> of all the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S>, Whether is better<S>2896</S> for you, either that all the sons<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S>, which are threescore and ten<S>7657</S> persons<S>376</S>, reign<S>4910</S> over you, or that one<S>259</S> reign<S>4910</S> over you? remember<S>2142</S> also that I am your bone<S>6106</S> and your flesh<S>1320</S>. <sup>Whether: Heb.

And his mother's<S>517</S> brethren<S>251</S> spake<S>1696</S> of him in the ears<S>241</S> of all the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> all these words<S>1697</S>: and their hearts<S>3820</S> inclined<S>5186</S> to follow<S>310</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>; for they said<S>559</S>, He is our brother<S>251</S>. <sup>to follow: Heb. after</sup>
And they gave<S>5414</S> him threescore and ten<S>7657</S> pieces of silver<S>3701</S> out of the house<S>1004</S> of Baalberith<S>1170</S>, wherewith Abimelech<S>40</S> hired<S>7936</S> vain<S>7386</S> and light<S>6348</S> persons<S>582</S>, which followed<S>3212</S> him<S>310</S>.
And he went<S>935</S> unto his father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S> at Ophrah<S>6084</S>, and slew<S>2026</S> his brethren<S>251</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S>, being threescore and ten<S>7657</S> persons<S>376</S>, upon one<S>259</S> stone<S>68</S>: notwithstanding yet Jotham<S>3147</S> the youngest<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S> was left<S>3498</S>; for he hid<S>2244</S> himself.
And all the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> gathered together<S>622</S>, and all the house<S>1004</S> of Millo<S>4407</S> <S>1037</S>, and went<S>3212</S>, and made<S>4427</S> Abimelech<S>40</S> king<S>4428</S>, by the plain<S>436</S> of the pillar<S>5324</S> that was in Shechem<S>7927</S>. <sup>plain: or, oak</sup>
And when they told<S>5046</S> it to Jotham<S>3147</S>, he went<S>3212</S> and stood<S>5975</S> in the top<S>7218</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Gerizim<S>1630</S>, and lifted up<S>5375</S> his voice<S>6963</S>, and cried<S>7121</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Hearken<S>8085</S> unto me, ye men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S>, that God<S>430</S> may hearken<S>8085</S> unto you.
The trees<S>6086</S> went forth<S>1980</S> <S>1980</S> on a time to anoint<S>4886</S> a king<S>4428</S> over them; and they said<S>559</S> unto the olive tree<S>2132</S>, Reign<S>4427</S> thou over us.
But the olive tree<S>2132</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Should I leave<S>2308</S> my fatness<S>1880</S>, wherewith by me they honour<S>3513</S> God<S>430</S> and man<S>582</S>, and go<S>1980</S> to be promoted<S>5128</S> over the trees<S>6086</S>? <sup>go: or, go up and down for other trees</sup>
And the trees<S>6086</S> said<S>559</S> to the fig tree<S>8384</S>, Come<S>3212</S> thou, and reign<S>4427</S> over us.
But the fig tree<S>8384</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Should I forsake<S>2308</S> my sweetness<S>4987</S>, and my good<S>2896</S> fruit<S>8570</S>, and go<S>1980</S> to be promoted<S>5128</S> over the trees<S>6086</S>?
Then said<S>559</S> the trees<S>6086</S> unto the vine<S>1612</S>, Come<S>3212</S> thou, and reign<S>4427</S> over us.
And the vine<S>1612</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Should I leave<S>2308</S> my wine<S>8492</S>, which cheereth<S>8055</S> God<S>430</S> and man<S>582</S>, and go<S>1980</S> to be promoted<S>5128</S> over the trees<S>6086</S>?
Then said<S>559</S> all the trees<S>6086</S> unto the bramble<S>329</S>, Come<S>3212</S> thou, and reign<S>4427</S> over us. <sup>bramble: or, thistle</sup>
And the bramble<S>329</S> said<S>559</S> unto the trees<S>6086</S>, If in truth<S>571</S> ye anoint<S>4886</S> me king<S>4428</S> over you, then come<S>935</S> and put your trust<S>2620</S> in my shadow<S>6738</S>: and if not, let fire<S>784</S> come out<S>3318</S> of the bramble<S>329</S>, and devour<S>398</S> the cedars<S>730</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S>.

And Jotham<S>3147</S> ran away<S>1272</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to Beer<S>876</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> there, for fear<S>6440</S> of Abimelech<S>40</S> his brother<S>251</S>.
When Abimelech<S>40</S> had reigned<S>7786</S> three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>,
Then God<S>430</S> sent<S>7971</S> an evil<S>7451</S> spirit<S>7307</S> between Abimelech<S>40</S> and the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S>; and the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> dealt treacherously<S>898</S> with Abimelech<S>40</S>:
That the cruelty<S>2555</S> done to the threescore and ten<S>7657</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S> might come<S>935</S>, and their blood<S>1818</S> be laid<S>7760</S> upon Abimelech<S>40</S> their brother<S>251</S>, which slew<S>2026</S> them; and upon the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S>, which aided<S>2388</S> <S>3027</S> him in the killing<S>2026</S> of his brethren<S>251</S>. <sup>aided: Heb. strengthened his hands to kill</sup>
And the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> set<S>7760</S> liers in wait<S>693</S> for him in the top<S>7218</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>, and they robbed<S>1497</S> all that came<S>5674</S> along that way<S>1870</S> by them: and it was told<S>5046</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>.
And Gaal<S>1603</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ebed<S>5651</S> came<S>935</S> with his brethren<S>251</S>, and went over<S>5674</S> to Shechem<S>7927</S>: and the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> put their confidence<S>982</S> in him.
And they went out<S>3318</S> into the fields<S>7704</S>, and gathered<S>1219</S> their vineyards<S>3754</S>, and trode<S>1869</S> the grapes, and made<S>6213</S> merry<S>1974</S>, and went<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of their god<S>430</S>, and did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>, and cursed<S>7043</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>. <sup>merry: or, songs</sup>

And Gaal<S>1603</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ebed<S>5651</S> went out<S>3318</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> in the entering<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> of the city<S>5892</S>: and Abimelech<S>40</S> rose up<S>6965</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> that were with him, from lying in wait<S>3993</S>.
And when Gaal<S>1603</S> saw<S>7200</S> the people<S>5971</S>, he said<S>559</S> to Zebul<S>2083</S>, Behold, there come<S>3381</S> people<S>5971</S> down<S>3381</S> from the top<S>7218</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>.

And Gaal<S>1603</S> went out<S>3318</S> before<S>6440</S> the men<S>1167</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with Abimelech<S>40</S>.
And Abimelech<S>40</S> chased<S>7291</S> him, and he fled<S>5127</S> before<S>6440</S> him, and many<S>7227</S> were overthrown<S>5307</S> and wounded<S>2491</S>, even unto the entering<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>.

And he took<S>3947</S> the people<S>5971</S>, and divided<S>2673</S> them into three<S>7969</S> companies<S>7218</S>, and laid wait<S>693</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, and looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, the people<S>5971</S> were come forth<S>3318</S> out of the city<S>5892</S>; and he rose up<S>6965</S> against them, and smote<S>5221</S> them.
And Abimelech<S>40</S>, and the company<S>7218</S> that was with him, rushed forward<S>6584</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> in the entering<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> of the city<S>5892</S>: and the two<S>8147</S> other companies<S>7218</S> ran upon<S>6584</S> all the people that were in the fields<S>7704</S>, and slew<S>5221</S> them.
And Abimelech<S>40</S> fought<S>3898</S> against the city<S>5892</S> all that day<S>3117</S>; and he took<S>3920</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and slew<S>2026</S> the people<S>5971</S> that was therein, and beat down<S>5422</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and sowed<S>2232</S> it with salt<S>4417</S>.
And when all the men<S>1167</S> of the tower<S>4026</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> heard<S>8085</S> that, they entered<S>935</S> into an hold<S>6877</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the god<S>410</S> Berith<S>1286</S>.
And it was told<S>5046</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>, that all the men<S>1167</S> of the tower<S>4026</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> were gathered together<S>6908</S>.
And Abimelech<S>40</S> gat him up<S>5927</S> to mount<S>2022</S> Zalmon<S>6756</S>, he and all the people<S>5971</S> that were with him; and Abimelech<S>40</S> took<S>3947</S> an axe<S>7134</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>, and cut down<S>3772</S> a bough<S>7754</S> from the trees<S>6086</S>, and took<S>5375</S> it, and laid<S>7760</S> it on his shoulder<S>7926</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S> that were with him, What ye have seen<S>7200</S> me do<S>6213</S>, make haste<S>4116</S>, and do<S>6213</S> as I<S>3644</S> have done. <sup>me do: Heb.

And all the people<S>5971</S> likewise cut down<S>3772</S> every man<S>376</S> his bough<S>7754</S>, and followed<S>3212</S> <S>310</S> Abimelech<S>40</S>, and put<S>7760</S> them to the hold<S>6877</S>, and set<S>3341</S> the hold<S>6877</S> on fire<S>784</S> upon them; so that all the men<S>582</S> of the tower<S>4026</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> died<S>4191</S> also, about a thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> and women<S>802</S>.
Then went<S>3212</S> Abimelech<S>40</S> to Thebez<S>8405</S>, and encamped<S>2583</S> against Thebez<S>8405</S>, and took<S>3920</S> it.
But there was a strong<S>5797</S> tower<S>4026</S> within<S>8432</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and thither fled<S>5127</S> all the men<S>582</S> and women<S>802</S>, and all they<S>1167</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and shut<S>5462</S> it to them, and gat them up<S>5927</S> to the top<S>1406</S> of the tower<S>4026</S>.
And Abimelech<S>40</S> came<S>935</S> unto the tower<S>4026</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> against it, and went hard<S>5066</S> unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tower<S>4026</S> to burn<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>.
And a certain<S>259</S> woman<S>802</S> cast<S>7993</S> a piece<S>6400</S> of a millstone<S>7393</S> upon Abimelech's<S>40</S> head<S>7218</S>, and all to brake<S>7533</S> his skull<S>1538</S>.
Then he called<S>7121</S> hastily<S>4120</S> unto the young man<S>5288</S> his armourbearer<S>5375</S> <S>3627</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Draw<S>8025</S> thy sword<S>2719</S>, and slay<S>4191</S> me, that men say<S>559</S> not of me, A woman<S>802</S> slew<S>2026</S> him. And his young man<S>5288</S> thrust him through<S>1856</S>, and he died<S>4191</S>.
And when the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> saw<S>7200</S> that Abimelech<S>40</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, they departed<S>3212</S> every man<S>376</S> unto his place<S>4725</S>.
Thus God<S>430</S> rendered<S>7725</S> the wickedness<S>7451</S> of Abimelech<S>40</S>, which he did<S>6213</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, in slaying<S>2026</S> his seventy<S>7657</S> brethren<S>251</S>:
And all the evil<S>7451</S> of the men<S>582</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> did God<S>430</S> render<S>7725</S> upon their heads<S>7218</S>: and upon them came<S>935</S> the curse<S>7045</S> of Jotham<S>3147</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jerubbaal<S>3378</S>.

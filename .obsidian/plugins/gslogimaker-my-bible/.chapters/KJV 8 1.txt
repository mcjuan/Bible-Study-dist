Now it came to pass in the days<S>3117</S> when the judges<S>8199</S> ruled<S>8199</S>, that there was a famine<S>7458</S> in the land<S>776</S>. And a certain man<S>376</S> of Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S> went<S>3212</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> in the country<S>7704</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, he, and his wife<S>802</S>, and his two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S>. <sup>ruled: Heb. judged</sup>
And the name<S>8034</S> of the man<S>376</S> was Elimelech<S>458</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of his wife<S>802</S> Naomi<S>5281</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of his two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> Mahlon<S>4248</S> and Chilion<S>3630</S>, Ephrathites<S>673</S> of Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S>. And they came<S>935</S> into the country<S>7704</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, and continued there. <sup>continued: Heb. were</sup>
And Elimelech<S>458</S> Naomi's<S>5281</S> husband<S>376</S> died<S>4191</S>; and she was left<S>7604</S>, and her two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S>.
And they took<S>5375</S> them wives<S>802</S> of the women<S>802</S> of Moab<S>4125</S>; the name<S>8034</S> of the one<S>259</S> was Orpah<S>6204</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of the other<S>8145</S> Ruth<S>7327</S>: and they dwelled<S>3427</S> there about ten<S>6235</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And Mahlon<S>4248</S> and Chilion<S>3630</S> died<S>4191</S> also both<S>8147</S> of them; and the woman<S>802</S> was left<S>7604</S> of her two<S>8147</S> sons<S>3206</S> and her husband<S>376</S>.
Then she arose<S>6965</S> with her daughters in law<S>3618</S>, that she might return<S>7725</S> from the country<S>7704</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>: for she had heard<S>8085</S> in the country<S>7704</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> how that the LORD<S>3068</S> had visited<S>6485</S> his people<S>5971</S> in giving<S>5414</S> them bread<S>3899</S>.
Wherefore she went forth<S>3318</S> out of the place<S>4725</S> where she was, and her two<S>8147</S> daughters in law<S>3618</S> with her; and they went<S>3212</S> on the way<S>1870</S> to return<S>7725</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
And Naomi<S>5281</S> said<S>559</S> unto her two<S>8147</S> daughters in law<S>3618</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, return<S>7725</S> each<S>802</S> to her mother's<S>517</S> house<S>1004</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> deal<S>6213</S> kindly<S>2617</S> with you, as ye have dealt<S>6213</S> with the dead<S>4191</S>, and with me.
The LORD<S>3068</S> grant<S>5414</S> you that ye may find<S>4672</S> rest<S>4496</S>, each<S>802</S> of you in the house<S>1004</S> of her husband<S>376</S>. Then she kissed<S>5401</S> them; and they lifted up<S>5375</S> their voice<S>6963</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>.
And they said<S>559</S> unto her, Surely we will return<S>7725</S> with thee unto thy people<S>5971</S>.
And Naomi<S>5281</S> said<S>559</S>, Turn again<S>7725</S>, my daughters<S>1323</S>: why will ye go<S>3212</S> with me? are there yet any more sons<S>1121</S> in my womb<S>4578</S>, that they may be your husbands<S>582</S>?
Turn again<S>7725</S>, my daughters<S>1323</S>, go<S>3212</S> your way; for I am too old<S>2204</S> to have an husband<S>376</S>. If I should say<S>559</S>, I have<S>3426</S> hope<S>8615</S>, if I should have an husband<S>376</S> also to night<S>3915</S>, and should also bear<S>3205</S> sons<S>1121</S>; <sup>should have: or were with an husband</sup>
Would ye tarry<S>7663</S> for them<S>3860</S> till they were grown<S>1431</S>? would ye stay<S>5702</S> for them<S>3860</S> from having husbands<S>376</S>? nay, my daughters<S>1323</S>; for it grieveth<S>4843</S> me much<S>3966</S> for your sakes that the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is gone out<S>3318</S> against me. <sup>tarry: Heb. hope</sup> <sup>it grieveth: Heb. I have much bitterness</sup>
And they lifted up<S>5375</S> their voice<S>6963</S>, and wept again<S>1058</S>: and Orpah<S>6204</S> kissed<S>5401</S> her mother in law<S>2545</S>; but Ruth<S>7327</S> clave<S>1692</S> unto her.
And she said<S>559</S>, Behold, thy sister in law<S>2994</S> is gone back<S>7725</S> unto her people<S>5971</S>, and unto her gods<S>430</S>: return<S>7725</S> thou after<S>310</S> thy sister in law<S>2994</S>.
And Ruth<S>7327</S> said<S>559</S>, Intreat<S>6293</S> me not to leave<S>5800</S> thee, or to return<S>7725</S> from following after<S>310</S> thee: for whither thou goest<S>3212</S>, I will go<S>3212</S>; and where thou lodgest<S>3885</S>, I will lodge<S>3885</S>: thy people<S>5971</S> shall be my people<S>5971</S>, and thy God<S>430</S> my God<S>430</S>: <sup>Intreat: or, Be not against me</sup>
Where thou diest<S>4191</S>, will I die<S>4191</S>, and there will I be buried<S>6912</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> do<S>6213</S> so to me, and more<S>3254</S> also, if ought but death<S>4194</S> part<S>6504</S> thee and me.
When she saw<S>7200</S> that she was stedfastly minded<S>553</S> to go<S>3212</S> with her, then she left<S>2308</S> speaking<S>1696</S> unto her. <sup>was: Heb. strengthened herself</sup>
So they two<S>8147</S> went<S>3212</S> until they came<S>935</S> to Bethlehem<S>1035</S>. And it came to pass, when they were come<S>935</S> to Bethlehem<S>1035</S>, that all the city<S>5892</S> was moved<S>1949</S> about them, and they said<S>559</S>, Is this Naomi<S>5281</S>?
And she said<S>559</S> unto them, Call<S>7121</S> me not Naomi<S>5281</S>, call<S>7121</S> me Mara<S>4755</S>: for the Almighty<S>7706</S> hath dealt very<S>3966</S> bitterly<S>4843</S> with me. <sup>Naomi: that is, Pleasant</sup> <sup>Mara: that is, Bitter</sup>
I went out<S>1980</S> full<S>4392</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath brought me home again<S>7725</S> empty<S>7387</S>: why then call<S>7121</S> ye me Naomi<S>5281</S>, seeing the LORD<S>3068</S> hath testified<S>6030</S> against me, and the Almighty<S>7706</S> hath afflicted<S>7489</S> me?
So Naomi<S>5281</S> returned<S>7725</S>, and Ruth<S>7327</S> the Moabitess<S>4125</S>, her daughter in law<S>3618</S>, with her, which returned<S>7725</S> out of the country<S>7704</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>: and they came<S>935</S> to Bethlehem<S>1035</S> in the beginning<S>8462</S> of barley<S>8184</S> harvest<S>7105</S>.

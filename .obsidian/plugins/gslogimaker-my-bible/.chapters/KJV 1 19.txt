And there came<S>935</S> two<S>8147</S> angels<S>4397</S> to Sodom<S>5467</S> at even<S>6153</S>; and Lot<S>3876</S> sat<S>3427</S> in the gate<S>8179</S> of Sodom<S>5467</S>: and Lot<S>3876</S> seeing<S>7200</S> them rose up<S>6965</S> to meet<S>7125</S> them; and he bowed<S>7812</S> himself with his face<S>639</S> toward the ground<S>776</S>;
And he said<S>559</S>, Behold now, my lords<S>113</S>, turn in<S>5493</S>, I pray you, into your servant's<S>5650</S> house<S>1004</S>, and tarry all night<S>3885</S>, and wash<S>7364</S> your feet<S>7272</S>, and ye shall rise up early<S>7925</S>, and go<S>1980</S> on your ways<S>1870</S>. And they said<S>559</S>, Nay; but we will abide<S>3885</S> in the street<S>7339</S> all night<S>3885</S>.
And he pressed<S>6484</S> upon them greatly<S>3966</S>; and they turned in<S>5493</S> unto him, and entered<S>935</S> into his house<S>1004</S>; and he made<S>6213</S> them a feast<S>4960</S>, and did bake<S>644</S> unleavened bread<S>4682</S>, and they did eat<S>398</S>.
But before they lay down<S>7901</S>, the men<S>582</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, even the men<S>582</S> of Sodom<S>5467</S>, compassed<S>5437</S> the house<S>1004</S> round<S>5437</S>, both old<S>2205</S> and young<S>5288</S>, all the people<S>5971</S> from every quarter<S>7097</S>:
And they called<S>7121</S> unto Lot<S>3876</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Where are the men<S>582</S> which came in<S>935</S> to thee this night<S>3915</S>? bring them out<S>3318</S> unto us, that we may know<S>3045</S> them.
And Lot<S>3876</S> went out<S>3318</S> at the door<S>6607</S> unto them, and shut<S>5462</S> the door<S>1817</S> after him<S>310</S>,
And said<S>559</S>, I pray you, brethren<S>251</S>, do not so wickedly<S>7489</S>.
Behold now, I have two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S> which have not known<S>3045</S> man<S>376</S>; let me, I pray you, bring them out<S>3318</S> unto you, and do<S>6213</S> ye to them as is good<S>2896</S> in your eyes<S>5869</S>: only unto these<S>411</S> men<S>582</S> do<S>6213</S> nothing<S>408</S> <S>1697</S>; for therefore came<S>935</S> they under the shadow<S>6738</S> of my roof<S>6982</S>.
And they said<S>559</S>, Stand<S>5066</S> back<S>1973</S>. And they said<S>559</S> again, This one<S>259</S> fellow came in<S>935</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S>, and he will needs<S>8199</S> be a judge<S>8199</S>: now will we deal worse<S>7489</S> with thee, than with them. And they pressed<S>6484</S> sore<S>3966</S> upon the man<S>376</S>, even Lot<S>3876</S>, and came near<S>5066</S> to break<S>7665</S> the door<S>1817</S>.
But the men<S>582</S> put forth<S>7971</S> their hand<S>3027</S>, and pulled<S>935</S> Lot<S>3876</S> into the house<S>1004</S> to them, and shut<S>5462</S> to the door<S>1817</S>.
And they smote<S>5221</S> the men<S>582</S> that were at the door<S>6607</S> of the house<S>1004</S> with blindness<S>5575</S>, both small<S>6996</S> and great<S>1419</S>: so that they wearied<S>3811</S> themselves to find<S>4672</S> the door<S>6607</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> said<S>559</S> unto Lot<S>3876</S>, Hast thou here<S>6311</S> any<S>4310</S> besides? son in law<S>2860</S>, and thy sons<S>1121</S>, and thy daughters<S>1323</S>, and whatsoever<S>834</S> thou hast in the city<S>5892</S>, bring them out<S>3318</S> of this place<S>4725</S>:
For we<S>587</S> will destroy<S>7843</S> <S>853</S> this place<S>4725</S>, because the cry of them<S>6818</S> is waxen great<S>1431</S> before<S>854</S> the face<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> us to destroy<S>7843</S> it.
And Lot<S>3876</S> went out<S>3318</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> unto his sons in law<S>2860</S>, which married<S>3947</S> his daughters<S>1323</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Up<S>6965</S>, get you out<S>3318</S> of this place<S>4725</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> will destroy<S>7843</S> this city<S>5892</S>. But he seemed as one that mocked<S>6711</S> unto<S>5869</S> his sons in law<S>2860</S>.
And when<S>3644</S> the morning<S>7837</S> arose<S>5927</S>, then the angels<S>4397</S> hastened<S>213</S> Lot<S>3876</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, take<S>3947</S> thy wife<S>802</S>, and thy two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S>, which are here<S>4672</S>; lest thou be consumed<S>5595</S> in the iniquity<S>5771</S> of the city<S>5892</S>. <sup>are here: Heb. are found</sup> <sup>iniquity: or, punishment</sup>
And while he lingered<S>4102</S>, the men<S>582</S> laid hold<S>2388</S> upon his hand<S>3027</S>, and upon the hand<S>3027</S> of his wife<S>802</S>, and upon the hand<S>3027</S> of his two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S>; the LORD<S>3068</S> being merciful<S>2551</S> unto him: and they brought him forth<S>3318</S>, and set him<S>3240</S> without<S>2351</S> the city<S>5892</S>.
And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth<S>3318</S> abroad<S>2351</S>, that he said<S>559</S>, Escape<S>4422</S> for<S>5921</S> thy life<S>5315</S>; look<S>5027</S> not behind thee<S>310</S>, neither stay<S>5975</S> thou in all the plain<S>3603</S>; escape<S>4422</S> to the mountain<S>2022</S>, lest thou be consumed<S>5595</S>.
And Lot<S>3876</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord<S>113</S>:
Behold now, thy servant<S>5650</S> hath found<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>, and thou hast magnified<S>1431</S> thy mercy<S>2617</S>, which thou hast shewed<S>6213</S> unto me<S>5978</S> in saving<S>2421</S> my life<S>5315</S>; and I cannot<S>3201</S> escape<S>4422</S> to the mountain<S>2022</S>, lest some evil<S>7451</S> take<S>1692</S> me, and I die<S>4191</S>:
Behold now, this city<S>5892</S> is near<S>7138</S> to flee<S>5127</S> unto, and it<S>1931</S> is a little one<S>4705</S>: Oh, let me escape<S>4422</S> thither, ( is it not a little one<S>4705</S>?) and my soul<S>5315</S> shall live<S>2421</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, See<S>2009</S>, I have accepted<S>5375</S> thee<S>6440</S> concerning this thing<S>1697</S> also, that I will not overthrow<S>2015</S> this city<S>5892</S>, for the which<S>834</S> thou hast spoken<S>1696</S>. <sup>thee: Heb. thy face</sup>
Haste<S>4116</S> thee, escape<S>4422</S> thither; for I cannot<S>3201</S> do<S>6213</S> any thing<S>1697</S> till thou be come<S>935</S> thither. Therefore the name<S>8034</S> of the city<S>5892</S> was called<S>7121</S> Zoar<S>6820</S>. <sup>Zoar: that is, Little</sup>
The sun<S>8121</S> was risen<S>3318</S> upon the earth<S>776</S> when Lot<S>3876</S> entered<S>935</S> into Zoar<S>6820</S>. <sup>risen: Heb. gone forth</sup>
Then the LORD<S>3068</S> rained<S>4305</S> upon Sodom<S>5467</S> and upon Gomorrah<S>6017</S> brimstone<S>1614</S> and fire<S>784</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S> out of heaven<S>8064</S>;
And he overthrew<S>2015</S> those<S>411</S> cities<S>5892</S>, and all the plain<S>3603</S>, and all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the cities<S>5892</S>, and that which grew<S>6780</S> upon the ground<S>127</S>.
But his wife<S>802</S> looked back<S>5027</S> from behind him<S>310</S>, and she became a pillar<S>5333</S> of salt<S>4417</S>.
And Abraham<S>85</S> gat up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S> to the place<S>4725</S> where he stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>:
And he looked<S>8259</S> toward<S>6440</S> Sodom<S>5467</S> and Gomorrah<S>6017</S>, and toward<S>6440</S> all the land<S>776</S> of the plain<S>3603</S>, and beheld<S>7200</S>, and, lo, the smoke<S>7008</S> of the country<S>776</S> went up<S>5927</S> as the smoke<S>7008</S> of a furnace<S>3536</S>.
And it came to pass, when God<S>430</S> destroyed<S>7843</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of the plain<S>3603</S>, that God<S>430</S> remembered<S>2142</S> Abraham<S>85</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> Lot<S>3876</S> out of the midst<S>8432</S> of the overthrow<S>2018</S>, when he overthrew<S>2015</S> the cities<S>5892</S> in the which<S>2004</S> Lot<S>3876</S> dwelt<S>3427</S>.
And Lot<S>3876</S> went up<S>5927</S> out of Zoar<S>6820</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in the mountain<S>2022</S>, and his two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S> with him; for he feared<S>3372</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> in Zoar<S>6820</S>: and he dwelt<S>3427</S> in a cave<S>4631</S>, he and his two<S>8147</S> daughters<S>1323</S>.
And the firstborn<S>1067</S> said<S>559</S> unto the younger<S>6810</S>, Our father<S>1</S> is old<S>2204</S>, and there is not a man<S>376</S> in the earth<S>776</S> to come in<S>935</S> unto us after the manner<S>1870</S> of all the earth<S>776</S>:
Come<S>3212</S>, let us make<S>8248</S> our father<S>1</S> drink<S>8248</S> wine<S>3196</S>, and we will lie<S>7901</S> with him, that we may preserve<S>2421</S> seed<S>2233</S> of our father<S>1</S>.
And they made<S>8248</S> their father<S>1</S> drink<S>8248</S> wine<S>3196</S> that night<S>3915</S>: and the firstborn<S>1067</S> went in<S>935</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> with her father<S>1</S>; and he perceived<S>3045</S> not when she lay down<S>7901</S>, nor when she arose<S>6965</S>.
And it came to pass on the morrow<S>4283</S>, that the firstborn<S>1067</S> said<S>559</S> unto the younger<S>6810</S>, Behold, I lay<S>7901</S> yesternight<S>570</S> with my father<S>1</S>: let us make him drink<S>8248</S> wine<S>3196</S> this night<S>3915</S> also; and go thou in<S>935</S>, and lie<S>7901</S> with him, that we may preserve<S>2421</S> seed<S>2233</S> of our father<S>1</S>.
And they made<S>8248</S> their father<S>1</S> drink<S>8248</S> wine<S>3196</S> that<S>1931</S> night<S>3915</S> also: and the younger<S>6810</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> with him; and he perceived<S>3045</S> not when she lay down<S>7901</S>, nor when she arose<S>6965</S>.
Thus were both<S>8147</S> the daughters<S>1323</S> of Lot<S>3876</S> with child<S>2029</S> by their father<S>1</S>.
And the firstborn<S>1067</S> bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Moab<S>4124</S>: the same<S>1931</S> is the father<S>1</S> of the Moabites<S>4124</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>.
And the younger<S>6810</S>, she also bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Benammi<S>1151</S>: the same is the father<S>1</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>.

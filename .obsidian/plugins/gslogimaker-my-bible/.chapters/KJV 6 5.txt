And it came to pass, when all the kings<S>4428</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, which were on the side<S>5676</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> westward<S>3220</S>, and all the kings<S>4428</S> of the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, which were by the sea<S>3220</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> had dried up<S>3001</S> the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> from before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, until we were passed over<S>5674</S>, that their heart<S>3824</S> melted<S>4549</S>, neither was there spirit<S>7307</S> in them any more, because<S>6440</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
At that time<S>6256</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Make<S>6213</S> thee sharp<S>6697</S> knives<S>2719</S>, and circumcise<S>4135</S> again<S>7725</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> the second time<S>8145</S>. <sup>sharp: or, knives of flints</sup>
And Joshua<S>3091</S> made<S>6213</S> him sharp<S>6697</S> knives<S>2719</S>, and circumcised<S>4135</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> at the hill<S>1389</S> of the foreskins<S>6190</S>. <sup>sharp: or, knives of flints</sup> <sup>the hill: or, Gibeah-haaraloth</sup>
And this is the cause<S>1697</S> why Joshua<S>3091</S> did circumcise<S>4135</S>: All the people<S>5971</S> that came out<S>3318</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, that were males<S>2145</S>, even all the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, died<S>4191</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> by the way<S>1870</S>, after they came out<S>3318</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Now<S>3588</S> all the people<S>5971</S> that came out<S>3318</S> were circumcised<S>4135</S>: but all the people<S>5971</S> that were born<S>3209</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> by the way<S>1870</S> as they came forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, them they had not circumcised<S>4135</S>.
For the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> walked<S>1980</S> forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, till all the people<S>1471</S> that were men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, which came out<S>3318</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, were consumed<S>8552</S>, because they obeyed<S>8085</S> not the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: unto whom the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> that he would not shew<S>7200</S> them the land<S>776</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto their fathers<S>1</S> that he would give<S>5414</S> us, a land<S>776</S> that floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>.
And their children<S>1121</S>, whom he raised up<S>6965</S> in their stead, them Joshua<S>3091</S> circumcised<S>4135</S>: for they were uncircumcised<S>6189</S>, because they had not circumcised<S>4135</S> them by the way<S>1870</S>.
And it came to pass, when they had done<S>8552</S> circumcising<S>4135</S> all the people<S>1471</S>, that they abode<S>3427</S> in their places in the camp<S>4264</S>, till they were whole<S>2421</S>. <sup>they had: Heb. the people had made an end to be circumcised</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, This day<S>3117</S> have I rolled away<S>1556</S> the reproach<S>2781</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> from off you. Wherefore the name<S>8034</S> of the place<S>4725</S> is called<S>7121</S> Gilgal<S>1537</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>Gilgal: that is Rolling</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> encamped<S>2583</S> in Gilgal<S>1537</S>, and kept<S>6213</S> the passover<S>6453</S> on the fourteenth<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S> at even<S>6153</S> in the plains<S>6160</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S>.
And they did eat<S>398</S> of the old corn<S>5669</S> of the land<S>776</S> on the morrow<S>4283</S> after the passover<S>6453</S>, unleavened cakes<S>4682</S>, and parched<S>7033</S> corn in the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S>.
And the manna<S>4478</S> ceased<S>7673</S> on the morrow<S>4283</S> after they had eaten<S>398</S> of the old corn<S>5669</S> of the land<S>776</S>; neither had the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> manna<S>4478</S> any more; but they did eat<S>398</S> of the fruit<S>8393</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> that year<S>8141</S>.
And it came to pass, when Joshua<S>3091</S> was by Jericho<S>3405</S>, that he lifted up<S>5375</S> his eyes<S>5869</S> and looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, there stood<S>5975</S> a man<S>376</S> over against him with his sword<S>2719</S> drawn<S>8025</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>: and Joshua<S>3091</S> went<S>3212</S> unto him, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries<S>6862</S>?
And he said<S>559</S>, Nay; but as captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> am I now come<S>935</S>. And Joshua<S>3091</S> fell<S>5307</S> on his face<S>6440</S> to the earth<S>776</S>, and did worship<S>7812</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, What saith<S>1696</S> my lord<S>113</S> unto his servant<S>5650</S>? <sup>captain: or, prince</sup>
And the captain<S>8269</S> of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> host<S>6635</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Loose<S>5394</S> thy shoe<S>5275</S> from off thy foot<S>7272</S>; for the place<S>4725</S> whereon thou standest<S>5975</S> is holy<S>6944</S>. And Joshua<S>3091</S> did<S>6213</S> so.

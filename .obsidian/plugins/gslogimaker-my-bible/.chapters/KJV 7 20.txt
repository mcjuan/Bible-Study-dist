Then all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went out<S>3318</S>, and the congregation<S>5712</S> was gathered together<S>6950</S> as one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S>, from Dan<S>1835</S> even to Beersheba<S>884</S>, with the land<S>776</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>, unto the LORD<S>3068</S> in Mizpeh<S>4709</S>.
And the chief<S>6438</S> of all the people<S>5971</S>, even of all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, presented<S>3320</S> themselves in the assembly<S>6951</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of God<S>430</S>, four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> footmen<S>376</S> <S>7273</S> that drew<S>8025</S> sword<S>2719</S>.
(Now the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> heard<S>8085</S> that the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were gone up<S>5927</S> to Mizpeh<S>4709</S>.) Then said<S>559</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Tell<S>1696</S> us, how was<S>1961</S> this wickedness<S>7451</S>?
And the Levite<S>3881</S> <S>376</S>, the husband<S>376</S> of the woman<S>802</S> that was slain<S>7523</S>, answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, I came<S>935</S> into Gibeah<S>1390</S> that belongeth to Benjamin<S>1144</S>, I and my concubine<S>6370</S>, to lodge<S>3885</S>. <sup>the Levite: Heb. the man the Levite</sup>

And I took<S>270</S> my concubine<S>6370</S>, and cut her in pieces<S>5408</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> her throughout all the country<S>7704</S> of the inheritance<S>5159</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: for they have committed<S>6213</S> lewdness<S>2154</S> and folly<S>5039</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>.
Behold, ye are all children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; give<S>3051</S> here<S>1988</S> your advice<S>1697</S> and counsel<S>6098</S>.
And all the people<S>5971</S> arose<S>6965</S> as one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S>, saying<S>559</S>, We will not any<S>376</S> of us go<S>3212</S> to his tent<S>168</S>, neither will we any<S>376</S> of us turn<S>5493</S> into his house<S>1004</S>.
But now this shall be the thing<S>1697</S> which we will do<S>6213</S> to Gibeah<S>1390</S>; we will go up by lot<S>1486</S> against it;
And we will take<S>3947</S> ten<S>6235</S> men<S>582</S> of an hundred<S>3967</S> throughout all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and an hundred<S>3967</S> of a thousand<S>505</S>, and a thousand<S>505</S> out of ten thousand<S>7233</S>, to fetch<S>3947</S> victual<S>6720</S> for the people<S>5971</S>, that they may do<S>6213</S>, when they come<S>935</S> to Gibeah<S>1387</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>, according to all the folly<S>5039</S> that they have wrought<S>6213</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>.
So all the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were gathered<S>622</S> against the city<S>5892</S>, knit together<S>2270</S> as one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S>. <sup>knit: Heb. fellows</sup>

And the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> were numbered<S>6485</S> at that time<S>3117</S> out of the cities<S>5892</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and six<S>8337</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> that drew<S>8025</S> sword<S>2719</S>, beside the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Gibeah<S>1390</S>, which were numbered<S>6485</S> seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chosen<S>977</S> men<S>376</S>.
Among all this people<S>5971</S> there were seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chosen<S>977</S> men<S>376</S> lefthanded<S>334</S> <S>3027</S> <S>3225</S>; every one could sling<S>7049</S> stones<S>68</S> at an hair<S>8185</S> breadth, and not miss<S>2398</S>.
And the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, beside Benjamin<S>1144</S>, were numbered<S>6485</S> four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> that drew<S>8025</S> sword<S>2719</S>: all these were men<S>376</S> of war<S>4421</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went up<S>5927</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> <S>1008</S>, and asked<S>7592</S> counsel of God<S>430</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Which<S>4310</S> of us shall go up<S>5927</S> first<S>8462</S> to the battle<S>4421</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>?

And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> rose up<S>6965</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and encamped<S>2583</S> against Gibeah<S>1390</S>.
And the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went out<S>3318</S> to battle<S>4421</S> against Benjamin<S>1144</S>; and the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> put themselves in array<S>6186</S> to fight<S>4421</S> against them at Gibeah<S>1390</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> came forth<S>3318</S> out of Gibeah<S>1390</S>, and destroyed down<S>7843</S> to the ground<S>776</S> of the Israelites<S>3478</S> that day<S>3117</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and two<S>8147</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>.

Then all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S>, went up<S>5927</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> <S>1008</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>, and sat<S>3427</S> there before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and fasted<S>6684</S> that day<S>3117</S> until even<S>6153</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> and peace offerings<S>8002</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> enquired<S>7592</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, (for the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of God<S>430</S> was there in those days<S>3117</S>,

And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went up<S>5927</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> on the third<S>7992</S> day<S>3117</S>, and put themselves in array<S>6186</S> against Gibeah<S>1390</S>, as at other times<S>6471</S>.

And all the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> rose up<S>6965</S> out of their place<S>4725</S>, and put themselves in array<S>6186</S> at Baaltamar<S>1193</S>: and the liers in wait<S>693</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came forth<S>1518</S> out of their places<S>4725</S>, even out of the meadows<S>4629</S> of Gibeah<S>1387</S>.

And the LORD<S>3068</S> smote<S>5062</S> Benjamin<S>1144</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>: and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> destroyed<S>7843</S> of the Benjamites<S>1145</S> that day<S>3117</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> thousand<S>505</S> and an hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S>: all these drew<S>8025</S> the sword<S>2719</S>.

Thus they inclosed<S>3803</S> the Benjamites<S>1145</S> round about<S>3803</S>, and chased<S>7291</S> them, and trode them down<S>1869</S> with ease<S>4496</S> over against<S>5227</S> Gibeah<S>1390</S> toward the sunrising<S>4217</S> <S>8121</S>. <sup>with ease: or, from Menuchah, etc</sup> <sup>over: Heb. unto over against</sup>

So that all which fell<S>5307</S> that day<S>3117</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> were twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> that drew<S>8025</S> the sword<S>2719</S>; all these were men<S>582</S> of valour<S>2428</S>.
But six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S> turned<S>6437</S> and fled<S>5127</S> to the wilderness<S>4057</S> unto the rock<S>5553</S> Rimmon<S>7417</S>, and abode<S>3427</S> in the rock<S>5553</S> Rimmon<S>7417</S> four<S>702</S> months<S>2320</S>.

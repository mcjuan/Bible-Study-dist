And it came to pass, when Samuel<S>8050</S> was old<S>2204</S>, that he made<S>7760</S> his sons<S>1121</S> judges<S>8199</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>.
Now the name<S>8034</S> of his firstborn<S>1121</S> <S>1060</S> was Joel<S>3100</S>; and the name<S>8034</S> of his second<S>4932</S>, Abiah<S>29</S>: they were judges<S>8199</S> in Beersheba<S>884</S>.
And his sons<S>1121</S> walked<S>1980</S> not in his ways<S>1870</S>, but turned aside<S>5186</S> after<S>310</S> lucre<S>1215</S>, and took<S>3947</S> bribes<S>7810</S>, and perverted<S>5186</S> judgment<S>4941</S>.
Then all the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> gathered themselves together<S>6908</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Samuel<S>8050</S> unto Ramah<S>7414</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, thou art old<S>2204</S>, and thy sons<S>1121</S> walk<S>1980</S> not in thy ways<S>1870</S>: now make<S>7760</S> us a king<S>4428</S> to judge<S>8199</S> us like all the nations<S>1471</S>.
But the thing<S>1697</S> displeased<S>3415</S> <S>5869</S> Samuel<S>8050</S>, when they said<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> us a king<S>4428</S> to judge<S>8199</S> us. And Samuel<S>8050</S> prayed<S>6419</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>displeased: Heb. was evil in the eyes of</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Samuel<S>8050</S>, Hearken<S>8085</S> unto the voice<S>6963</S> of the people<S>5971</S> in all that they say<S>559</S> unto thee: for they have not rejected<S>3988</S> thee, but they have rejected<S>3988</S> me, that I should not reign<S>4427</S> over them.
According to all the works<S>4639</S> which they have done<S>6213</S> since the day<S>3117</S> that I brought them up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S> even unto this day<S>3117</S>, wherewith they have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and served<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, so do<S>6213</S> they also unto thee.
Now therefore hearken<S>8085</S> unto their voice<S>6963</S>: howbeit<S>389</S> yet protest<S>5749</S> solemnly<S>5749</S> unto them, and shew<S>5046</S> them the manner<S>4941</S> of the king<S>4428</S> that shall reign<S>4427</S> over them. <sup>hearken: or, obey</sup> <sup>howbeit: or, notwithstanding when thou hast solemnly protested against them then thou shalt</sup>
And Samuel<S>8050</S> told<S>559</S> all the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto the people<S>5971</S> that asked<S>7592</S> of him a king<S>4428</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, This will be the manner<S>4941</S> of the king<S>4428</S> that shall reign<S>4427</S> over you: He will take<S>3947</S> your sons<S>1121</S>, and appoint<S>7760</S> them for himself, for his chariots<S>4818</S>, and to be his horsemen<S>6571</S>; and some shall run<S>7323</S> before<S>6440</S> his chariots<S>4818</S>.
And he will appoint<S>7760</S> him captains<S>8269</S> over thousands<S>505</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over fifties<S>2572</S>; and will set them to ear<S>2790</S> his ground<S>2758</S>, and to reap<S>7114</S> his harvest<S>7105</S>, and to make<S>6213</S> his instruments<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and instruments<S>3627</S> of his chariots<S>7393</S>.
And he will take<S>3947</S> your daughters<S>1323</S> to be confectionaries<S>7548</S>, and to be cooks<S>2879</S>, and to be bakers<S>644</S>.
And he will take<S>3947</S> your fields<S>7704</S>, and your vineyards<S>3754</S>, and your oliveyards<S>2132</S>, even the best<S>2896</S> of them, and give<S>5414</S> them to his servants<S>5650</S>.
And he will take the tenth<S>6237</S> of your seed<S>2233</S>, and of your vineyards<S>3754</S>, and give<S>5414</S> to his officers<S>5631</S>, and to his servants<S>5650</S>. <sup>officers: Heb. eunuchs</sup>
And he will take<S>3947</S> your menservants<S>5650</S>, and your maidservants<S>8198</S>, and your goodliest<S>2896</S> young men<S>970</S>, and your asses<S>2543</S>, and put<S>6213</S> them to his work<S>4399</S>.
He will take the tenth<S>6237</S> of your sheep<S>6629</S>: and ye shall be his servants<S>5650</S>.
And ye shall cry out<S>2199</S> in that day<S>3117</S> because<S>6440</S> of your king<S>4428</S> which ye shall have chosen<S>977</S> you; and the LORD<S>3068</S> will not hear<S>6030</S> you in that day<S>3117</S>.
Nevertheless the people<S>5971</S> refused<S>3985</S> to obey<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of Samuel<S>8050</S>; and they said<S>559</S>, Nay; but we will have a king<S>4428</S> over us;
That we also may be like all the nations<S>1471</S>; and that our king<S>4428</S> may judge<S>8199</S> us, and go out<S>3318</S> before<S>6440</S> us, and fight<S>3898</S> our battles<S>4421</S>.
And Samuel<S>8050</S> heard<S>8085</S> all the words<S>1697</S> of the people<S>5971</S>, and he rehearsed<S>1696</S> them in the ears<S>241</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> to Samuel<S>8050</S>, Hearken<S>8085</S> unto their voice<S>6963</S>, and make<S>4427</S> them a king<S>4428</S>. And Samuel<S>8050</S> said<S>559</S> unto the men<S>582</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Go<S>3212</S> ye every man<S>376</S> unto his city<S>5892</S>.

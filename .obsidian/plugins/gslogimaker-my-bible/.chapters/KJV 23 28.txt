Because ye have said<S>559</S>, We have made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with death<S>4194</S>, and with hell<S>7585</S> are we<S>6213</S> at agreement<S>2374</S>; when the overflowing<S>7857</S> scourge<S>7752</S> <S>7885</S> shall pass through<S>5674</S> <S>5674</S>, it shall not come<S>935</S> unto us: for we have made<S>7760</S> lies<S>3577</S> our refuge<S>4268</S>, and under falsehood<S>8267</S> have we hid<S>5641</S> ourselves:
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, Behold, I lay<S>3245</S> in Zion<S>6726</S> for a foundation a stone<S>68</S>, a tried<S>976</S> stone<S>68</S>, a precious<S>3368</S> corner<S>6438</S> stone, a sure<S>3245</S> foundation<S>4143</S>: he that believeth<S>539</S> shall not make haste<S>2363</S>.

And your covenant<S>1285</S> with death<S>4194</S> shall be disannulled<S>3722</S>, and your agreement<S>2380</S> with hell<S>7585</S> shall not stand<S>6965</S>; when the overflowing<S>7857</S> scourge<S>7752</S> shall pass through<S>5674</S>, then ye shall be trodden down<S>4823</S> by it. <sup>trodden: Heb. a treading down to it</sup>

For the LORD<S>3068</S> shall rise up<S>6965</S> as in mount<S>2022</S> Perazim<S>6559</S>, he shall be wroth<S>7264</S> as in the valley<S>6010</S> of Gibeon<S>1391</S>, that he may do<S>6213</S> his work<S>4639</S>, his strange<S>2114</S> work<S>4639</S>; and bring to pass<S>5647</S> his act<S>5656</S>, his strange<S>5237</S> act<S>5656</S>.

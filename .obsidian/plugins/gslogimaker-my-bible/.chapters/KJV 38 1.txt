In the eighth<S>8066</S> month<S>2320</S>, in the second<S>8147</S> year<S>8141</S> of Darius<S>1867</S>, came the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto Zechariah<S>2148</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Berechiah<S>1296</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Iddo<S>5714</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
The LORD<S>3068</S> hath been sore<S>7110</S> displeased<S>7107</S> with your fathers<S>1</S>. <sup>sore: Heb. with displeasure</sup>
Therefore say<S>559</S> thou unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; Turn<S>7725</S> ye unto me, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, and I will turn<S>7725</S> unto you, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>.
Be ye not as your fathers<S>1</S>, unto whom the former<S>7223</S> prophets<S>5030</S> have cried<S>7121</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; Turn<S>7725</S> ye now from your evil<S>7451</S> ways<S>1870</S>, and from your evil<S>7451</S> doings<S>4611</S>: but they did not hear<S>8085</S>, nor hearken<S>7181</S> unto me, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Your fathers<S>1</S>, where are they? and the prophets<S>5030</S>, do they live<S>2421</S> for ever<S>5769</S>?
But my words<S>1697</S> and my statutes<S>2706</S>, which I commanded<S>6680</S> my servants<S>5650</S> the prophets<S>5030</S>, did they not take hold<S>5381</S> of your fathers<S>1</S>? and they returned<S>7725</S> and said<S>559</S>, Like as the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> thought<S>2161</S> to do<S>6213</S> unto us, according to our ways<S>1870</S>, and according to our doings<S>4611</S>, so hath he dealt<S>6213</S> with us. <sup>take: or, overtake</sup>
Upon the four<S>702</S> and twentieth<S>6242</S> day<S>3117</S> of the eleventh<S>6249</S> <S>6240</S> month<S>2320</S>, which is the month<S>2320</S> Sebat<S>7627</S>, in the second<S>8147</S> year<S>8141</S> of Darius<S>1867</S>, came the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto Zechariah<S>2148</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Berechiah<S>1296</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Iddo<S>5714</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
I saw<S>7200</S> by night<S>3915</S>, and behold a man<S>376</S> riding<S>7392</S> upon a red<S>122</S> horse<S>5483</S>, and he stood<S>5975</S> among the myrtle trees<S>1918</S> that were in the bottom<S>4699</S>; and behind<S>310</S> him were there red<S>122</S> horses<S>5483</S>, speckled<S>8320</S>, and white<S>3836</S>. <sup>speckled: or, bay</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> I, O my lord<S>113</S>, what are these? And the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me said<S>559</S> unto me, I will shew<S>7200</S> thee what these be.
And the man<S>376</S> that stood<S>5975</S> among the myrtle trees<S>1918</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, These are they whom the LORD<S>3068</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> to walk<S>1980</S> to and fro through the earth<S>776</S>.
And they answered<S>6030</S> the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> that stood<S>5975</S> among the myrtle trees<S>1918</S>, and said<S>559</S>, We have walked to and fro<S>1980</S> through the earth<S>776</S>, and, behold, all the earth<S>776</S> sitteth still<S>3427</S>, and is at rest<S>8252</S>.
Then the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, how long wilt thou not have mercy<S>7355</S> on Jerusalem<S>3389</S> and on the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, against which thou hast had indignation<S>2194</S> these threescore and ten<S>7657</S> years<S>8141</S>?
And the LORD<S>3068</S> answered<S>6030</S> the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me with good<S>2896</S> words<S>1697</S> and comfortable<S>5150</S> words<S>1697</S>.
So the angel<S>4397</S> that communed<S>1696</S> with me said<S>559</S> unto me, Cry<S>7121</S> thou, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; I am jealous<S>7065</S> for Jerusalem<S>3389</S> and for Zion<S>6726</S> with a great<S>1419</S> jealousy<S>7068</S>.
And I am very<S>1419</S> sore<S>7110</S> displeased<S>7107</S> with the heathen<S>1471</S> that are at ease<S>7600</S>: for I was but a little<S>4592</S> displeased<S>7107</S>, and they helped<S>5826</S> forward the affliction<S>7451</S>.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; I am returned<S>7725</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with mercies<S>7356</S>: my house<S>1004</S> shall be built<S>1129</S> in it, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, and a line<S>6957</S> <S>6961</S> shall be stretched forth<S>5186</S> upon Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Cry<S>7121</S> yet, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; My cities<S>5892</S> through prosperity<S>2896</S> shall yet be spread abroad<S>6327</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> shall yet comfort<S>5162</S> Zion<S>6726</S>, and shall yet choose<S>977</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>prosperity: Heb. good</sup>
Then lifted I up<S>5375</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and saw<S>7200</S>, and behold four<S>702</S> horns<S>7161</S>.
And I said<S>559</S> unto the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me, What be these? And he answered<S>559</S> me, These are the horns<S>7161</S> which have scattered<S>2219</S> Judah<S>3063</S>, Israel<S>3478</S>, and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> shewed<S>7200</S> me four<S>702</S> carpenters<S>2796</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> I, What come<S>935</S> these to do<S>6213</S>? And he spake<S>559</S>, saying<S>559</S>, These are the horns<S>7161</S> which have scattered<S>2219</S> Judah<S>3063</S>, so that<S>6310</S> no man<S>376</S> did lift up<S>5375</S> his head<S>7218</S>: but these are come<S>935</S> to fray<S>2729</S> them, to cast out<S>3034</S> the horns<S>7161</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S>, which lifted up<S>5375</S> their horn<S>7161</S> over the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> to scatter<S>2219</S> it.

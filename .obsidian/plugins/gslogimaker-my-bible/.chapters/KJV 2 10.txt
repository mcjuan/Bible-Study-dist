And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Go<S>935</S> in unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: for I have hardened<S>3513</S> his heart<S>3820</S>, and the heart<S>3820</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>, that I might shew<S>7896</S> these my signs<S>226</S> before<S>7130</S> him:
And that thou mayest tell<S>5608</S> in the ears<S>241</S> of thy son<S>1121</S>, and of thy son's<S>1121</S> son<S>1121</S>, what things I have wrought<S>5953</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and my signs<S>226</S> which I have done<S>7760</S> among them; that ye may know<S>3045</S> how that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> came in<S>935</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S>, How long<S>4970</S> wilt thou refuse<S>3985</S> to humble<S>6031</S> thyself before<S>6440</S> me? let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me.
Else<S>3588</S>, if thou refuse<S>3986</S> to let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, behold, to morrow<S>4279</S> will I bring<S>935</S> the locusts<S>697</S> into thy coast<S>1366</S>:
And they shall cover<S>3680</S> the face<S>5869</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, that one cannot be able<S>3201</S> to see<S>7200</S> the earth<S>776</S>: and they shall eat<S>398</S> the residue<S>3499</S> of that which is escaped<S>6413</S>, which remaineth<S>7604</S> unto you from the hail<S>1259</S>, and shall eat<S>398</S> every tree<S>6086</S> which groweth<S>6779</S> for you out of the field<S>7704</S>: <sup>face: Heb. eye</sup>
And they shall fill<S>4390</S> thy houses<S>1004</S>, and the houses<S>1004</S> of all thy servants<S>5650</S>, and the houses<S>1004</S> of all the Egyptians<S>4714</S>; which neither thy fathers<S>1</S>, nor thy fathers'<S>1</S> fathers<S>1</S> have seen<S>7200</S>, since the day<S>3117</S> that they were upon the earth<S>127</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>. And he turned<S>6437</S> himself, and went out<S>3318</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> servants<S>5650</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, How long shall this man be a snare<S>4170</S> unto us? let the men<S>582</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>: knowest<S>3045</S> thou not yet<S>2962</S> that Egypt<S>4714</S> is destroyed<S>6</S>?
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> were brought again<S>7725</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and he said<S>559</S> unto them, Go<S>3212</S>, serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>: but who are they that shall go<S>1980</S>? <sup>who: Heb. who and who, etc</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, We will go<S>3212</S> with our young<S>5288</S> and with our old<S>2205</S>, with our sons<S>1121</S> and with our daughters<S>1323</S>, with our flocks<S>6629</S> and with our herds<S>1241</S> will we go<S>3212</S>; for we must hold a feast<S>2282</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Let the LORD<S>3068</S> be so with you, as I will let you go<S>7971</S>, and your little ones<S>2945</S>: look<S>7200</S> to it; for evil<S>7451</S> is before<S>6440</S> you.
Not so: go<S>3212</S> now ye that are men<S>1397</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; for that ye did desire<S>1245</S>. And they were driven out<S>1644</S> from Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> presence<S>6440</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Stretch out<S>5186</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> over the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> for the locusts<S>697</S>, that they may come up<S>5927</S> upon the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and eat<S>398</S> every herb<S>6212</S> of the land<S>776</S>, even all that the hail<S>1259</S> hath left<S>7604</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> stretched forth<S>5186</S> his rod<S>4294</S> over the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> brought<S>5090</S> an east<S>6921</S> wind<S>7307</S> upon the land<S>776</S> all that day<S>3117</S>, and all that night<S>3915</S>; and when it was morning<S>1242</S>, the east<S>6921</S> wind<S>7307</S> brought<S>5375</S> the locusts<S>697</S>.
And the locusts<S>697</S> went up<S>5927</S> over all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and rested<S>5117</S> in all the coasts<S>1366</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>: very<S>3966</S> grievous<S>3515</S> were they; before<S>6440</S> them there were no such<S>3651</S> locusts<S>697</S> as they, neither after<S>310</S> them shall be such.
For they covered<S>3680</S> the face<S>5869</S> of the whole earth<S>776</S>, so that the land<S>776</S> was darkened<S>2821</S>; and they did eat<S>398</S> every herb<S>6212</S> of the land<S>776</S>, and all the fruit<S>6529</S> of the trees<S>6086</S> which the hail<S>1259</S> had left<S>3498</S>: and there remained<S>3498</S> not any green thing<S>3418</S> in the trees<S>6086</S>, or in the herbs<S>6212</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, through all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Then Pharaoh<S>6547</S> called<S>7121</S> for Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> in haste<S>4116</S>; and he said<S>559</S>, I have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, and against you. <sup>called: Heb. hastened to call</sup>
Now therefore forgive<S>5375</S>, I pray thee, my sin<S>2403</S> only this once<S>6471</S>, and intreat<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, that he may take away<S>5493</S> from me this death<S>4194</S> only.
And he went out<S>3318</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and intreated<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> turned<S>2015</S> a mighty<S>3966</S> strong<S>2389</S> west<S>3220</S> wind<S>7307</S>, which took away<S>5375</S> the locusts<S>697</S>, and cast<S>8628</S> them into the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>; there remained<S>7604</S> not one<S>259</S> locust<S>697</S> in all the coasts<S>1366</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. <sup>cast: Heb. fastened</sup>
But the LORD<S>3068</S> hardened<S>2388</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S>, so that he would not let the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> go<S>7971</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Stretch out<S>5186</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>, that there may be darkness<S>2822</S> over the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, even darkness<S>2822</S> which may be felt<S>4959</S>. <sup>even: Heb. that one may feel darkness</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> stretched forth<S>5186</S> his hand<S>3027</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>; and there was a thick<S>653</S> darkness<S>2822</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>:
They saw<S>7200</S> not one<S>376</S> another<S>251</S>, neither rose<S>6965</S> any<S>376</S> from his place for three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>: but all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> had light<S>216</S> in their dwellings<S>4186</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> called<S>7121</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S> ye, serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; only let your flocks<S>6629</S> and your herds<S>1241</S> be stayed<S>3322</S>: let your little ones<S>2945</S> also go<S>3212</S> with you.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Thou must give<S>5414</S> us<S>3027</S> also sacrifices<S>2077</S> and burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, that we may sacrifice<S>6213</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>. <sup>us: Heb. into our hands</sup>
Our cattle<S>4735</S> also shall go<S>3212</S> with us; there shall not an hoof<S>6541</S> be left behind<S>7604</S>; for thereof must we take<S>3947</S> to serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>; and we know<S>3045</S> not with what we must serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, until we come<S>935</S> thither.
But the LORD<S>3068</S> hardened<S>2388</S> Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> heart<S>3820</S>, and he would<S>14</S> not let them go<S>7971</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Get<S>3212</S> thee from me, take heed<S>8104</S> to thyself, see<S>7200</S> my face<S>6440</S> no more<S>3254</S>; for in that day<S>3117</S> thou seest<S>7200</S> my face<S>6440</S> thou shalt die<S>4191</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Thou hast spoken<S>1696</S> well<S>3651</S>, I will see<S>7200</S> thy face<S>6440</S> again<S>3254</S> no more.

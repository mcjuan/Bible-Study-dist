Then we turned<S>6437</S>, and took our journey<S>5265</S> into the wilderness<S>4057</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto me: and we compassed<S>5437</S> mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S> many<S>7227</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Ye have compassed<S>5437</S> this mountain<S>2022</S> long enough<S>7227</S>: turn<S>6437</S> you northward<S>6828</S>.
And command<S>6680</S> thou the people<S>5971</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Ye are to pass<S>5674</S> through the coast<S>1366</S> of your brethren<S>251</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>, which dwell<S>3427</S> in Seir<S>8165</S>; and they shall be afraid<S>3372</S> of you: take ye good<S>3966</S> heed<S>8104</S> unto yourselves therefore:
Meddle<S>1624</S> not with them; for I will not give<S>5414</S> you of their land<S>776</S>, no, not so much as a foot<S>7272</S> breadth<S>4096</S> <S>3709</S>; because I have given<S>5414</S> mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S> unto Esau<S>6215</S> for a possession<S>3425</S>. <sup>no: Heb. even to the treading of the sole of the foot</sup>
Ye shall buy<S>7666</S> meat<S>400</S> of them for money<S>3701</S>, that ye may eat<S>398</S>; and ye shall also buy<S>3739</S> water<S>4325</S> of them for money<S>3701</S>, that ye may drink<S>8354</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath blessed<S>1288</S> thee in all the works<S>4639</S> of thy hand<S>3027</S>: he knoweth<S>3045</S> thy walking<S>3212</S> through this great<S>1419</S> wilderness<S>4057</S>: these forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath been with thee; thou hast lacked<S>2637</S> nothing<S>1697</S>.
And when we passed<S>5674</S> by from our brethren<S>251</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> in Seir<S>8165</S>, through the way<S>1870</S> of the plain<S>6160</S> from Elath<S>359</S>, and from Eziongaber<S>6100</S>, we turned<S>6437</S> and passed<S>5674</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Distress<S>6696</S> not the Moabites<S>4124</S>, neither contend<S>1624</S> with them in battle<S>4421</S>: for I will not give<S>5414</S> thee of their land<S>776</S> for a possession<S>3425</S>; because I have given<S>5414</S> Ar<S>6144</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Lot<S>3876</S> for a possession<S>3425</S>. <sup>Distress: or, Use no hostility against Moab</sup>
The Emims<S>368</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> therein in times past<S>6440</S>, a people<S>5971</S> great<S>1419</S>, and many<S>7227</S>, and tall<S>7311</S>, as the Anakims<S>6062</S>;
Which<S>1992</S> also were accounted<S>2803</S> giants<S>7497</S>, as the Anakims<S>6062</S>; but the Moabites<S>4125</S> call<S>7121</S> them Emims<S>368</S>.
The Horims<S>2752</S> also dwelt<S>3427</S> in Seir<S>8165</S> beforetime<S>6440</S>; but the children<S>1121</S> of Esau<S>6215</S> succeeded<S>3423</S> them, when they had destroyed<S>8045</S> them from before<S>6440</S> them, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in their stead; as Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of his possession<S>3425</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> gave<S>5414</S> unto them. <sup>succeeded: Heb. inherited</sup> <sup>stead: or, room</sup>
Now rise up<S>6965</S>, said I, and get you over<S>5674</S> the brook<S>5158</S> Zered<S>2218</S>. And we went over<S>5674</S> the brook<S>5158</S> Zered<S>2218</S>. <sup>brook: or, valley</sup>
And the space<S>3117</S> in which we came<S>1980</S> from Kadeshbarnea<S>6947</S>, until we were come over<S>5674</S> the brook<S>5158</S> Zered<S>2218</S>, was thirty<S>7970</S> and eight<S>8083</S> years<S>8141</S>; until all the generation<S>1755</S> of the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S> were wasted out<S>8552</S> from among<S>7130</S> the host<S>4264</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto them. <sup>brook: or, valley</sup>
For indeed the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was against them, to destroy<S>2000</S> them from among<S>7130</S> the host<S>4264</S>, until they were consumed<S>8552</S>.
So it came to pass, when all the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S> were consumed<S>8552</S> and dead<S>4191</S> from among<S>7130</S> the people<S>5971</S>,
That the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Thou art to pass over<S>5674</S> through Ar<S>6144</S>, the coast<S>1366</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, this day<S>3117</S>:
And when thou comest nigh<S>7126</S> over against<S>4136</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, distress<S>6696</S> them not, nor meddle<S>1624</S> with them: for I will not give<S>5414</S> thee of the land<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> any possession<S>3425</S>; because I have given<S>5414</S> it unto the children<S>1121</S> of Lot<S>3876</S> for a possession<S>3425</S>.
(That also was accounted<S>2803</S> a land<S>776</S> of giants<S>7497</S>: giants<S>7497</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> therein in old time<S>6440</S>; and the Ammonites<S>5984</S> call<S>7121</S> them Zamzummims<S>2157</S>;
A people<S>5971</S> great<S>1419</S>, and many<S>7227</S>, and tall<S>7311</S>, as the Anakims<S>6062</S>; but the LORD<S>3068</S> destroyed<S>8045</S> them before<S>6440</S> them; and they succeeded<S>3423</S> them, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in their stead:
As he did<S>6213</S> to the children<S>1121</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> in Seir<S>8165</S>, when he destroyed<S>8045</S> the Horims<S>2752</S> from before<S>6440</S> them; and they succeeded<S>3423</S> them, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in their stead even unto this day<S>3117</S>:
And the Avims<S>5761</S> which dwelt<S>3427</S> in Hazerim<S>2699</S>, even unto Azzah<S>5804</S>, the Caphtorims<S>3732</S>, which came forth<S>3318</S> out of Caphtor<S>3731</S>, destroyed<S>8045</S> them, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in their stead.)
Rise ye up<S>6965</S>, take your journey<S>5265</S>, and pass over<S>5674</S> the river<S>5158</S> Arnon<S>769</S>: behold<S>7200</S>, I have given<S>5414</S> into thine hand<S>3027</S> Sihon<S>5511</S> the Amorite<S>567</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Heshbon<S>2809</S>, and his land<S>776</S>: begin<S>2490</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it, and contend<S>1624</S> with him in battle<S>4421</S>. <sup>begin: Heb. begin, possess</sup>
This day<S>3117</S> will I begin<S>2490</S> to put<S>5414</S> the dread<S>6343</S> of thee and the fear<S>3374</S> of thee upon the nations<S>6440</S> <S>5971</S> that are under the whole heaven<S>8064</S>, who shall hear<S>8085</S> report<S>8088</S> of thee, and shall tremble<S>7264</S>, and be in anguish<S>2342</S> because of thee<S>6440</S>.
And I sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> out of the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Kedemoth<S>6932</S> unto Sihon<S>5511</S> king<S>4428</S> of Heshbon<S>2809</S> with words<S>1697</S> of peace<S>7965</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Let me pass<S>5674</S> through thy land<S>776</S>: I will go<S>3212</S> along by the high way<S>1870</S> <S>1870</S>, I will neither turn<S>5493</S> unto the right hand<S>3225</S> nor to the left<S>8040</S>.
Thou shalt sell<S>7666</S> me meat<S>400</S> for money<S>3701</S>, that I may eat<S>398</S>; and give<S>5414</S> me water<S>4325</S> for money<S>3701</S>, that I may drink<S>8354</S>: only I will pass through<S>5674</S> on my feet<S>7272</S>;
(As the children<S>1121</S> of Esau<S>6215</S> which dwell<S>3427</S> in Seir<S>8165</S>, and the Moabites<S>4125</S> which dwell<S>3427</S> in Ar<S>6144</S>, did<S>6213</S> unto me;) until I shall pass over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> into the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> us.
But Sihon<S>5511</S> king<S>4428</S> of Heshbon<S>2809</S> would<S>14</S> not let us pass<S>5674</S> by him: for the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hardened<S>7185</S> his spirit<S>7307</S>, and made his heart<S>3824</S> obstinate<S>553</S>, that he might deliver<S>5414</S> him into thy hand<S>3027</S>, as appeareth this day<S>3117</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Behold<S>7200</S>, I have begun<S>2490</S> to give<S>5414</S> Sihon<S>5511</S> and his land<S>776</S> before<S>6440</S> thee: begin<S>2490</S> to possess<S>3423</S>, that thou mayest inherit<S>3423</S> his land<S>776</S>.
Then Sihon<S>5511</S> came out<S>3318</S> against<S>7125</S> us, he and all his people<S>5971</S>, to fight<S>4421</S> at Jahaz<S>3096</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> delivered<S>5414</S> him before<S>6440</S> us; and we smote<S>5221</S> him, and his sons<S>1121</S>, and all his people<S>5971</S>.
And we took<S>3920</S> all his cities<S>5892</S> at that time<S>6256</S>, and utterly destroyed<S>2763</S> the men<S>4962</S>, and the women<S>802</S>, and the little ones<S>2945</S>, of every city<S>5892</S>, we left<S>7604</S> none to remain<S>8300</S>: <sup>the men: Heb. every city of men, and women, and little ones</sup>

From Aroer<S>6177</S>, which is by the brink<S>8193</S> of the river<S>5158</S> of Arnon<S>769</S>, and from the city<S>5892</S> that is by the river<S>5158</S>, even unto Gilead<S>1568</S>, there was not one city<S>7151</S> too strong<S>7682</S> for us: the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> delivered<S>5414</S> all unto us<S>6440</S>:
Only unto the land<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> thou camest<S>7126</S> not, nor unto any place<S>3027</S> of the river<S>5158</S> Jabbok<S>2999</S>, nor unto the cities<S>5892</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S>, nor unto whatsoever the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> forbad<S>6680</S> us.

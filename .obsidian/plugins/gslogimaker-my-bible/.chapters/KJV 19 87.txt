A Psalm<S>4210</S> or Song<S>7892</S> for the sons<S>1121</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>. His foundation<S>3248</S> is in the holy<S>6944</S> mountains<S>2042</S>. <sup>for the sons: or, of the sons</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> loveth<S>157</S> the gates<S>8179</S> of Zion<S>6726</S> more than all the dwellings<S>4908</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>.
Glorious things<S>3513</S> are spoken<S>1696</S> of thee, O city<S>5892</S> of God<S>430</S>. Selah<S>5542</S>.
I will make mention<S>2142</S> of Rahab<S>7294</S> and Babylon<S>894</S> to them that know<S>3045</S> me: behold Philistia<S>6429</S>, and Tyre<S>6865</S>, with Ethiopia<S>3568</S>; this man was born<S>3205</S> there.
And of Zion<S>6726</S> it shall be said<S>559</S>, This and that man<S>376</S> was born<S>3205</S> in her: and the highest<S>5945</S> himself shall establish<S>3559</S> her.
The LORD<S>3068</S> shall count<S>5608</S>, when he writeth up<S>3789</S> the people<S>5971</S>, that this man was born<S>3205</S> there. Selah<S>5542</S>.
As well the singers<S>7891</S> as the players<S>2490</S> on instruments shall be there: all my springs<S>4599</S> are in thee.

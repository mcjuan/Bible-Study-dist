To the chief Musician<S>5329</S>, A Psalm<S>4210</S> for the sons<S>1121</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>. Hear<S>8085</S> this, all ye people<S>5971</S>; give ear<S>238</S>, all ye inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the world<S>2465</S>: <sup>for: or, of</sup>
Both low<S>1121</S> <S>120</S> and high<S>1121</S> <S>376</S>, rich<S>6223</S> and poor<S>34</S>, together<S>3162</S>.
My mouth<S>6310</S> shall speak<S>1696</S> of wisdom<S>2454</S>; and the meditation<S>1900</S> of my heart<S>3820</S> shall be of understanding<S>8394</S>.
I will incline<S>5186</S> mine ear<S>241</S> to a parable<S>4912</S>: I will open<S>6605</S> my dark saying<S>2420</S> upon the harp<S>3658</S>.
Wherefore should I fear<S>3372</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of evil<S>7451</S>, when the iniquity<S>5771</S> of my heels<S>6120</S> shall compass<S>5437</S> me about?
They that trust<S>982</S> in their wealth<S>2428</S>, and boast<S>1984</S> themselves in the multitude<S>7230</S> of their riches<S>6239</S>;
None of them can<S>376</S> by any means<S>6299</S> redeem<S>6299</S> his brother<S>251</S>, nor give<S>5414</S> to God<S>430</S> a ransom<S>3724</S> for him:
(For the redemption<S>6306</S> of their soul<S>5315</S> is precious<S>3365</S>, and it ceaseth<S>2308</S> for ever<S>5769</S>:)
That he should still live<S>2421</S> for ever<S>5331</S>, and not see<S>7200</S> corruption<S>7845</S>.
For he seeth<S>7200</S> that wise men<S>2450</S> die<S>4191</S>, likewise<S>3162</S> the fool<S>3684</S> and the brutish person<S>1198</S> perish<S>6</S>, and leave<S>5800</S> their wealth<S>2428</S> to others<S>312</S>.
Their inward<S>7130</S> thought is, that their houses<S>1004</S> shall continue for ever<S>5769</S>, and their dwelling<S>4908</S> places to all<S>1755</S> generations<S>1755</S>; they call<S>7121</S> their lands<S>127</S> after their own names<S>8034</S>. <sup>all: Heb. generation and generation</sup>
Nevertheless man<S>120</S> being in honour<S>3366</S> abideth<S>3885</S> not: he is like<S>4911</S> the beasts<S>929</S> that perish<S>1820</S>.
This their way<S>1870</S> is their folly<S>3689</S>: yet their posterity<S>310</S> approve<S>7521</S> their sayings<S>6310</S>. Selah<S>5542</S>. <sup>approve: Heb. delight in their mouth</sup>
Like sheep<S>6629</S> they are laid<S>8371</S> in the grave<S>7585</S>; death<S>4194</S> shall feed<S>7462</S> on them; and the upright<S>3477</S> shall have dominion<S>7287</S> over them in the morning<S>1242</S>; and their beauty<S>6697</S> <S>6736</S> shall consume<S>1086</S> in the grave<S>7585</S> from their dwelling<S>2073</S>. <sup>beauty: or, strength</sup> <sup>in the grave from: or, the grave being an habitation to every one of them</sup>
But God<S>430</S> will redeem<S>6299</S> my soul<S>5315</S> from the power<S>3027</S> of the grave<S>7585</S>: for he shall receive<S>3947</S> me. Selah<S>5542</S>. <sup>power: Heb. hand</sup> <sup>the grave: or, hell</sup>
Be not thou afraid<S>3372</S> when one<S>376</S> is made rich<S>6238</S>, when the glory<S>3519</S> of his house<S>1004</S> is increased<S>7235</S>;
For when he dieth<S>4194</S> he shall carry nothing away<S>3947</S>: his glory<S>3519</S> shall not descend<S>3381</S> after<S>310</S> him.
Though while he lived<S>2416</S> he blessed<S>1288</S> his soul<S>5315</S>: and men will praise<S>3034</S> thee, when thou doest well<S>3190</S> to thyself. <sup>while: Heb. in his life</sup>
He shall go<S>935</S> to the generation<S>1755</S> of his fathers<S>1</S>; they shall never<S>3808</S> <S>5331</S> see<S>7200</S> light<S>216</S>. <sup>He: Heb. The soul shall</sup>
Man<S>120</S> that is in honour<S>3366</S>, and understandeth<S>995</S> not, is like<S>4911</S> the beasts<S>929</S> that perish<S>1820</S>.

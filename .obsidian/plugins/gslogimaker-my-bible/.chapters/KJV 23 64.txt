Oh<S>3863</S> that thou wouldest rend<S>7167</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>, that thou wouldest come down<S>3381</S>, that the mountains<S>2022</S> might flow down<S>2151</S> at thy presence<S>6440</S>,
As when the melting<S>2003</S> fire<S>784</S> burneth<S>6919</S>, the fire<S>784</S> causeth the waters<S>4325</S> to boil<S>1158</S>, to make thy name<S>8034</S> known<S>3045</S> to thine adversaries<S>6862</S>, that the nations<S>1471</S> may tremble<S>7264</S> at thy presence<S>6440</S>! <sup>the melting: Heb. the fire of meltings</sup>
When thou didst<S>6213</S> terrible things<S>3372</S> which we looked<S>6960</S> not for, thou camest down<S>3381</S>, the mountains<S>2022</S> flowed down<S>2151</S> at thy presence<S>6440</S>.
For since the beginning of the world<S>5769</S> men have not heard<S>8085</S>, nor perceived by the ear<S>238</S>, neither hath the eye<S>5869</S> seen<S>7200</S>, O God<S>430</S>, beside<S>2108</S> thee, what he hath prepared<S>6213</S> for him that waiteth<S>2442</S> for him. <sup>seen: or, seen a God beside thee, which doeth so for him, etc</sup>
Thou meetest<S>6293</S> him that rejoiceth<S>7797</S> and worketh<S>6213</S> righteousness<S>6664</S>, those that remember<S>2142</S> thee in thy ways<S>1870</S>: behold, thou art wroth<S>7107</S>; for we have sinned<S>2398</S>: in those is continuance<S>5769</S>, and we shall be saved<S>3467</S>.
But we are all as an unclean<S>2931</S> thing, and all our righteousnesses<S>6666</S> are as filthy<S>5708</S> rags<S>899</S>; and we all do fade<S>5034</S> <S>1101</S> as a leaf<S>5929</S>; and our iniquities<S>5771</S>, like the wind<S>7307</S>, have taken us away<S>5375</S>.
And there is none that calleth<S>7121</S> upon thy name<S>8034</S>, that stirreth up<S>5782</S> himself to take hold<S>2388</S> of thee: for thou hast hid<S>5641</S> thy face<S>6440</S> from us, and hast consumed<S>4127</S> us, because<S>3027</S> of our iniquities<S>5771</S>. <sup>consumed: Heb. melted</sup> <sup>because: Heb. by the hand</sup>
But now, O LORD<S>3068</S>, thou art our father<S>1</S>; we are the clay<S>2563</S>, and thou our potter<S>3335</S>; and we all are the work<S>4639</S> of thy hand<S>3027</S>.
Be not wroth<S>7107</S> very sore<S>3966</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, neither remember<S>2142</S> iniquity<S>5771</S> for ever<S>5703</S>: behold, see<S>5027</S>, we beseech thee, we are all thy people<S>5971</S>.
Thy holy<S>6944</S> cities<S>5892</S> are a wilderness<S>4057</S>, Zion<S>6726</S> is a wilderness<S>4057</S>, Jerusalem<S>3389</S> a desolation<S>8077</S>.
Our holy<S>6944</S> and our beautiful<S>8597</S> house<S>1004</S>, where our fathers<S>1</S> praised<S>1984</S> thee, is burned up<S>8316</S> with fire<S>784</S>: and all our pleasant things<S>4261</S> are laid waste<S>2723</S>.
Wilt thou refrain<S>662</S> thyself for these things, O LORD<S>3068</S>? wilt thou hold thy peace<S>2814</S>, and afflict<S>6031</S> us very sore<S>3966</S>?

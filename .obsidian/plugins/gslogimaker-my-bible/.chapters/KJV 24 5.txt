Run ye to and fro<S>7751</S> through the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and see<S>7200</S> now, and know<S>3045</S>, and seek<S>1245</S> in the broad places<S>7339</S> thereof, if ye can find<S>4672</S> a man<S>376</S>, if there be<S>3426</S> any that executeth<S>6213</S> judgment<S>4941</S>, that seeketh<S>1245</S> the truth<S>530</S>; and I will pardon<S>5545</S> it.
And though they say<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>; surely they swear<S>7650</S> falsely<S>8267</S>.
O LORD<S>3068</S>, are not thine eyes<S>5869</S> upon the truth<S>530</S>? thou hast stricken<S>5221</S> them, but they have not grieved<S>2342</S>; thou hast consumed<S>3615</S> them, but they have refused<S>3985</S> to receive<S>3947</S> correction<S>4148</S>: they have made their faces<S>6440</S> harder<S>2388</S> than a rock<S>5553</S>; they have refused<S>3985</S> to return<S>7725</S>.
Therefore I said<S>559</S>, Surely these are poor<S>1800</S>; they are foolish<S>2973</S>: for they know<S>3045</S> not the way<S>1870</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, nor the judgment<S>4941</S> of their God<S>430</S>.
I will get<S>3212</S> me unto the great men<S>1419</S>, and will speak<S>1696</S> unto them; for they have known<S>3045</S> the way<S>1870</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the judgment<S>4941</S> of their God<S>430</S>: but these have altogether<S>3162</S> broken<S>7665</S> the yoke<S>5923</S>, and burst<S>5423</S> the bonds<S>4147</S>.
Wherefore a lion<S>738</S> out of the forest<S>3293</S> shall slay<S>5221</S> them, and a wolf<S>2061</S> of the evenings<S>6160</S> shall spoil<S>7703</S> them, a leopard<S>5246</S> shall watch<S>8245</S> over their cities<S>5892</S>: every one that goeth out<S>3318</S> thence shall<S>2007</S> be torn in pieces<S>2963</S>: because their transgressions<S>6588</S> are many<S>7231</S>, and their backslidings<S>4878</S> are increased<S>6105</S>. <sup>evenings: or, deserts</sup> <sup>are increased: Heb. are strong</sup>
How<S>335</S> shall I pardon<S>5545</S> thee for this<S>2063</S>? thy children<S>1121</S> have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and sworn<S>7650</S> by them that are no<S>3808</S> gods<S>430</S>: when I had fed them to the full<S>7650</S>, they then committed adultery<S>5003</S>, and assembled themselves by troops<S>1413</S> in the harlots'<S>2181</S> houses<S>1004</S>.
They were as fed<S>2109</S> horses<S>5483</S> in the morning<S>7904</S>: every one<S>376</S> neighed<S>6670</S> after his neighbour's<S>7453</S> wife<S>802</S>.
Shall I not visit<S>6485</S> for these things? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and shall not my soul<S>5315</S> be avenged<S>5358</S> on such a nation<S>1471</S> as this?
Go ye up<S>5927</S> upon her walls<S>8284</S>, and destroy<S>7843</S>; but make<S>6213</S> not a full end<S>3617</S>: take away<S>5493</S> her battlements<S>5189</S>; for they are not the LORD'S<S>3068</S>.
For the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> have dealt very<S>898</S> treacherously<S>898</S> against me, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
They have belied<S>3584</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, It is not he; neither shall evil<S>7451</S> come<S>935</S> upon us; neither shall we see<S>7200</S> sword<S>2719</S> nor famine<S>7458</S>:
And the prophets<S>5030</S> shall become wind<S>7307</S>, and the word<S>1696</S> is not in them: thus shall it be done<S>6213</S> unto them.
Wherefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, Because ye speak<S>1696</S> this word<S>1697</S>, behold, I will make<S>5414</S> my words<S>1697</S> in thy mouth<S>6310</S> fire<S>784</S>, and this people<S>5971</S> wood<S>6086</S>, and it shall devour<S>398</S> them.
Lo, I will bring<S>935</S> a nation<S>1471</S> upon you from far<S>4801</S>, O house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: it is a mighty<S>386</S> nation<S>1471</S>, it is an ancient<S>5769</S> nation<S>1471</S>, a nation<S>1471</S> whose language<S>3956</S> thou knowest<S>3045</S> not, neither understandest<S>8085</S> what they say<S>1696</S>.
Their quiver<S>827</S> is as an open<S>6605</S> sepulchre<S>6913</S>, they are all mighty men<S>1368</S>.
And they shall eat up<S>398</S> thine harvest<S>7105</S>, and thy bread<S>3899</S>, which thy sons<S>1121</S> and thy daughters<S>1323</S> should eat<S>398</S>: they shall eat up<S>398</S> thy flocks<S>6629</S> and thine herds<S>1241</S>: they shall eat up<S>398</S> thy vines<S>1612</S> and thy fig trees<S>8384</S>: they shall impoverish<S>7567</S> thy fenced<S>4013</S> cities<S>5892</S>, wherein thou<S>2007</S> trustedst<S>982</S>, with the sword<S>2719</S>.
Nevertheless in those days<S>3117</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, I will not make<S>6213</S> a full end<S>3617</S> with you.
And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say<S>559</S>, Wherefore<S>8478</S> <S>4100</S> doeth<S>6213</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer<S>559</S> them, Like as ye have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and served<S>5647</S> strange<S>5236</S> gods<S>430</S> in your land<S>776</S>, so shall ye serve<S>5647</S> strangers<S>2114</S> in a land<S>776</S> that is not yours.
Declare<S>5046</S> this in the house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, and publish<S>8085</S> it in Judah<S>3063</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Hear<S>8085</S> now this, O foolish<S>5530</S> people<S>5971</S>, and without understanding<S>3820</S>; which have eyes<S>5869</S>, and see<S>7200</S> not; which have ears<S>241</S>, and hear<S>8085</S> not: <sup>understanding: Heb. heart</sup>
Fear<S>3372</S> ye not me? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: will ye not tremble<S>2342</S> at my presence<S>6440</S>, which have placed<S>7760</S> the sand<S>2344</S> for the bound<S>1366</S> of the sea<S>3220</S> by a perpetual<S>5769</S> decree<S>2706</S>, that it cannot pass<S>5674</S> it: and though the waves<S>1530</S> thereof toss<S>1607</S> themselves, yet can they not prevail<S>3201</S>; though they roar<S>1993</S>, yet can they not pass over<S>5674</S> it?
But this people<S>5971</S> hath a revolting<S>5637</S> and a rebellious<S>4784</S> heart<S>3820</S>; they are revolted<S>5493</S> and gone<S>3212</S>.
Neither say<S>559</S> they in their heart<S>3824</S>, Let us now fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, that giveth<S>5414</S> rain<S>1653</S>, both the former<S>3138</S> and the latter<S>4456</S>, in his season<S>6256</S>: he reserveth<S>8104</S> unto us the appointed<S>2708</S> weeks<S>7620</S> of the harvest<S>7105</S>.
Your iniquities<S>5771</S> have turned away<S>5186</S> these things, and your sins<S>2403</S> have withholden<S>4513</S> good<S>2896</S> things from you.
For among my people<S>5971</S> are found<S>4672</S> wicked<S>7563</S> men: they lay wait<S>7789</S>, as he that setteth<S>7918</S> snares<S>3353</S>; they set<S>5324</S> a trap<S>4889</S>, they catch<S>3920</S> men<S>582</S>. <sup>they lay: or, they pry as fowlers lie in wait</sup>
As a cage<S>3619</S> is full<S>4392</S> of birds<S>5775</S>, so are their houses<S>1004</S> full<S>4392</S> of deceit<S>4820</S>: therefore they are become great<S>1431</S>, and waxen rich<S>6238</S>. <sup>cage: or, coop</sup>
They are waxen fat<S>8080</S>, they shine<S>6245</S>: yea, they overpass<S>5674</S> the deeds<S>1697</S> of the wicked<S>7451</S>: they judge<S>1777</S> not the cause<S>1779</S>, the cause of the fatherless<S>3490</S>, yet they prosper<S>6743</S>; and the right<S>4941</S> of the needy<S>34</S> do they not judge<S>8199</S>.
Shall I not visit<S>6485</S> for these things? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: shall not my soul<S>5315</S> be avenged<S>5358</S> on such a nation<S>1471</S> as this?

The word<S>1697</S> that came to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> concerning all the Jews<S>3064</S> which dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, which dwell<S>3427</S> at Migdol<S>4024</S>, and at Tahpanhes<S>8471</S>, and at Noph<S>5297</S>, and in the country<S>776</S> of Pathros<S>6624</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Ye have seen<S>7200</S> all the evil<S>7451</S> that I have brought<S>935</S> upon Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and upon all the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>; and, behold, this day<S>3117</S> they are a desolation<S>2723</S>, and no man dwelleth<S>3427</S> therein,
Because<S>6440</S> of their wickedness<S>7451</S> which they have committed<S>6213</S> to provoke me to anger<S>3707</S>, in that they went<S>3212</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S>, and to serve<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, whom they knew<S>3045</S> not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers<S>1</S>.
Howbeit I sent<S>7971</S> unto you all my servants<S>5650</S> the prophets<S>5030</S>, rising early<S>7925</S> and sending<S>7971</S> them, saying<S>559</S>, Oh, do<S>6213</S> not this abominable<S>8441</S> thing<S>1697</S> that I hate<S>8130</S>.
But they hearkened<S>8085</S> not, nor inclined<S>5186</S> their ear<S>241</S> to turn<S>7725</S> from their wickedness<S>7451</S>, to burn no incense<S>6999</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>.
Wherefore my fury<S>2534</S> and mine anger<S>639</S> was poured forth<S>5413</S>, and was kindled<S>1197</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and in the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and they are wasted<S>2723</S> and desolate<S>8077</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>.
Therefore now thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Wherefore commit<S>6213</S> ye this great<S>1419</S> evil<S>7451</S> against your souls<S>5315</S>, to cut off<S>3772</S> from you man<S>376</S> and woman<S>802</S>, child<S>5768</S> and suckling<S>3243</S>, out<S>8432</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, to leave<S>3498</S> you none to remain<S>7611</S>; <sup>out: Heb. out of the midst of Judah</sup>
In that ye provoke me unto wrath<S>3707</S> with the works<S>4639</S> of your hands<S>3027</S>, burning incense<S>6999</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, whither ye be gone<S>935</S> to dwell<S>1481</S>, that ye might cut yourselves off<S>3772</S>, and that ye might be a curse<S>7045</S> and a reproach<S>2781</S> among all the nations<S>1471</S> of the earth<S>776</S>?
Have ye forgotten<S>7911</S> the wickedness<S>7451</S> of your fathers<S>1</S>, and the wickedness<S>7451</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and the wickedness<S>7451</S> of their wives<S>802</S>, and your own wickedness<S>7451</S>, and the wickedness<S>7451</S> of your wives<S>802</S>, which they have committed<S>6213</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>? <sup>wickedness: Heb. wickednesses, or, punishments, etc</sup>
They are not humbled<S>1792</S> even unto this day<S>3117</S>, neither have they feared<S>3372</S>, nor walked<S>1980</S> in my law<S>8451</S>, nor in my statutes<S>2708</S>, that I set<S>5414</S> before<S>6440</S> you and before<S>6440</S> your fathers<S>1</S>. <sup>humbled: Heb. contrite</sup>
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Behold, I will set<S>7760</S> my face<S>6440</S> against you for evil<S>7451</S>, and to cut off<S>3772</S> all Judah<S>3063</S>.
And I will take<S>3947</S> the remnant<S>7611</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, that have set<S>7760</S> their faces<S>6440</S> to go<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> there, and they shall all be consumed<S>8552</S>, and fall<S>5307</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; they shall even be consumed<S>8552</S> by the sword<S>2719</S> and by the famine<S>7458</S>: they shall die<S>4191</S>, from the least<S>6996</S> even unto the greatest<S>1419</S>, by the sword<S>2719</S> and by the famine<S>7458</S>: and they shall be an execration<S>423</S>, and an astonishment<S>8047</S>, and a curse<S>7045</S>, and a reproach<S>2781</S>.
For I will punish<S>6485</S> them that dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, as I have punished<S>6485</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, by the sword<S>2719</S>, by the famine<S>7458</S>, and by the pestilence<S>1698</S>:
So that none of the remnant<S>7611</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, which are gone<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> there, shall escape<S>6412</S> or remain<S>8300</S>, that they should return<S>7725</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, to the which they have<S>5375</S> a desire<S>5315</S> to return<S>7725</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> there: for none shall return<S>7725</S> but such as shall escape<S>6405</S>. <sup>have: Heb. lift up their soul</sup>
Then all the men<S>582</S> which knew<S>3045</S> that their wives<S>802</S> had burned incense<S>6999</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, and all the women<S>802</S> that stood by<S>5975</S>, a great<S>1419</S> multitude<S>6951</S>, even all the people<S>5971</S> that dwelt<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, in Pathros<S>6624</S>, answered<S>6030</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
As for the word<S>1697</S> that thou hast spoken<S>1696</S> unto us in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, we will not hearken<S>8085</S> unto thee.
But we will certainly<S>6213</S> do<S>6213</S> whatsoever thing<S>1697</S> goeth forth<S>3318</S> out of our own mouth<S>6310</S>, to burn incense<S>6999</S> unto the queen<S>4446</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and to pour out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto her, as we have done<S>6213</S>, we, and our fathers<S>1</S>, our kings<S>4428</S>, and our princes<S>8269</S>, in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: for then had we plenty<S>7646</S> of victuals<S>3899</S>, and were well<S>2896</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> no evil<S>7451</S>. <sup>queen: or, frame of heaven</sup> <sup>victuals: Heb. bread</sup>
But since we left off<S>2308</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S> to the queen<S>4446</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and to pour out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto her, we have wanted<S>2637</S> all things, and have been consumed<S>8552</S> by the sword<S>2719</S> and by the famine<S>7458</S>.
And when we burned incense<S>6999</S> to the queen<S>4446</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and poured out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto her, did we make<S>6213</S> her cakes<S>3561</S> to worship<S>6087</S> her, and pour out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto her, without<S>1107</S> our men<S>582</S>? <sup>men: or, husbands?</sup>
Then Jeremiah<S>3414</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S>, to the men<S>1397</S>, and to the women<S>802</S>, and to all the people<S>5971</S> which had given him that answer<S>1697</S> <S>6030</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
The incense<S>7002</S> that ye burned<S>6999</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the streets<S>2351</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, ye, and your fathers<S>1</S>, your kings<S>4428</S>, and your princes<S>8269</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, did not the LORD<S>3068</S> remember<S>2142</S> them, and came<S>5927</S> it not into his mind<S>3820</S>?
So that the LORD<S>3068</S> could<S>3201</S> no longer bear<S>5375</S>, because<S>6440</S> of the evil<S>7455</S> of your doings<S>4611</S>, and because<S>6440</S> of the abominations<S>8441</S> which ye have committed<S>6213</S>; therefore is your land<S>776</S> a desolation<S>2723</S>, and an astonishment<S>8047</S>, and a curse<S>7045</S>, without an inhabitant<S>3427</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>.
Because<S>6440</S> <S>834</S> ye have burned incense<S>6999</S>, and because ye have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>, and have not obeyed<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, nor walked<S>1980</S> in his law<S>8451</S>, nor in his statutes<S>2708</S>, nor in his testimonies<S>5715</S>; therefore this evil<S>7451</S> is happened<S>7122</S> unto you, as at this day<S>3117</S>.
Moreover Jeremiah<S>3414</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S>, and to all the women<S>802</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, all Judah<S>3063</S> that are in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>:
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>; Ye and your wives<S>802</S> have both spoken<S>1696</S> with your mouths<S>6310</S>, and fulfilled<S>4390</S> with your hand<S>3027</S>, saying<S>559</S>, We will surely<S>6213</S> perform<S>6213</S> our vows<S>5088</S> that we have vowed<S>5087</S>, to burn incense<S>6999</S> to the queen<S>4446</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and to pour out<S>5258</S> drink offerings<S>5262</S> unto her: ye will surely<S>6965</S> accomplish<S>6965</S> your vows<S>5088</S>, and surely<S>6213</S> perform<S>6213</S> your vows<S>5088</S>.
Therefore hear<S>8085</S> ye the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, all Judah<S>3063</S> that dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; Behold, I have sworn<S>7650</S> by my great<S>1419</S> name<S>8034</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that my name<S>8034</S> shall no more be named<S>7121</S> in the mouth<S>6310</S> of any man<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> liveth<S>2416</S>.
Behold, I will watch<S>8245</S> over them for evil<S>7451</S>, and not for good<S>2896</S>: and all the men<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> that are in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> shall be consumed<S>8552</S> by the sword<S>2719</S> and by the famine<S>7458</S>, until there be an end<S>3615</S> of them.
Yet a small<S>4962</S> number<S>4557</S> that escape<S>6412</S> the sword<S>2719</S> shall return out<S>7725</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and all the remnant<S>7611</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, that are gone<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> there, shall know<S>3045</S> whose words<S>1697</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>, mine, or theirs. <sup>mine: Heb. from me, or, from them</sup>

I am come<S>935</S> into my garden<S>1588</S>, my sister<S>269</S>, my spouse<S>3618</S>: I have gathered<S>717</S> my myrrh<S>4753</S> with my spice<S>1313</S>; I have eaten<S>398</S> my honeycomb<S>3293</S> with my honey<S>1706</S>; I have drunk<S>8354</S> my wine<S>3196</S> with my milk<S>2461</S>: eat<S>398</S>, O friends<S>7453</S>; drink<S>8354</S>, yea, drink abundantly<S>7937</S>, O beloved<S>1730</S>. <sup>yea: or, and be drunken with loves</sup>
I sleep<S>3463</S>, but my heart<S>3820</S> waketh<S>5782</S>: it is the voice<S>6963</S> of my beloved<S>1730</S> that knocketh<S>1849</S>, saying, Open<S>6605</S> to me, my sister<S>269</S>, my love<S>7474</S>, my dove<S>3123</S>, my undefiled<S>8535</S>: for my head<S>7218</S> is filled<S>4390</S> with dew<S>2919</S>, and my locks<S>6977</S> with the drops<S>7447</S> of the night<S>3915</S>.
I have put off<S>6584</S> my coat<S>3801</S>; how<S>349</S> shall I put it on<S>3847</S>? I have washed<S>7364</S> my feet<S>7272</S>; how<S>349</S> shall I defile<S>2936</S> them?
My beloved<S>1730</S> put in<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S> by<S>4480</S> the hole<S>2356</S> of the door, and my bowels<S>4578</S> were moved<S>1993</S> for him. <sup>for him: or, (as some read) in me</sup>
I rose up<S>6965</S> to open<S>6605</S> to my beloved<S>1730</S>; and my hands<S>3027</S> dropped<S>5197</S> with myrrh<S>4753</S>, and my fingers<S>676</S> with sweet smelling<S>5674</S> myrrh<S>4753</S>, upon the handles<S>3709</S> of the lock<S>4514</S>. <sup>sweet: Heb. passing, or, running about</sup>
I opened<S>6605</S> to my beloved<S>1730</S>; but my beloved<S>1730</S> had withdrawn<S>2559</S> himself, and was gone<S>5674</S>: my soul<S>5315</S> failed<S>3318</S> when he spake<S>1696</S>: I sought<S>1245</S> him, but I could not find<S>4672</S> him; I called<S>7121</S> him, but he gave me no answer<S>6030</S>.
The watchmen<S>8104</S> that went about<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> found<S>4672</S> me, they smote<S>5221</S> me, they wounded<S>6481</S> me; the keepers<S>8104</S> of the walls<S>2346</S> took away<S>5375</S> my veil<S>7289</S> from me.
I charge<S>7650</S> you, O daughters<S>1323</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, if ye find<S>4672</S> my beloved<S>1730</S>, that ye tell<S>5046</S> him, that I am sick<S>2470</S> of love<S>160</S>. <sup>that ye: Heb. what, etc</sup>
What is thy beloved<S>1730</S> more than another beloved<S>1730</S>, O thou fairest<S>3303</S> among women<S>802</S>? what is thy beloved<S>1730</S> more than another beloved<S>1730</S>, that thou<S>3602</S> dost so charge<S>7650</S> us?
My beloved<S>1730</S> is white<S>6703</S> and ruddy<S>122</S>, the chiefest<S>1713</S> among ten thousand<S>7233</S>. <sup>the chiefest: Heb. a standard bearer</sup>

His cheeks<S>3895</S> are as a bed<S>6170</S> of spices<S>1314</S>, as sweet<S>4840</S> flowers<S>4026</S>: his lips<S>8193</S> like lilies<S>7799</S>, dropping<S>5197</S> sweet smelling<S>5674</S> myrrh<S>4753</S>. <sup>sweet flowers: or, towers of perfumes</sup>
His hands<S>3027</S> are as gold<S>2091</S> rings<S>1550</S> set<S>4390</S> with the beryl<S>8658</S>: his belly<S>4578</S> is as bright<S>6247</S> ivory<S>8127</S> overlaid<S>5968</S> with sapphires<S>5601</S>.
His legs<S>7785</S> are as pillars<S>5982</S> of marble<S>8336</S>, set<S>3245</S> upon sockets<S>134</S> of fine gold<S>6337</S>: his countenance<S>4758</S> is as Lebanon<S>3844</S>, excellent<S>977</S> as the cedars<S>730</S>.
His mouth<S>2441</S> is most sweet<S>4477</S>: yea, he is altogether lovely<S>4261</S>. This is my beloved<S>1730</S>, and this is my friend<S>7453</S>, O daughters<S>1323</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>mouth: Heb. palate</sup>

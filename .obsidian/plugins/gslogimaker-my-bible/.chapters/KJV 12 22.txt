Josiah<S>2977</S> was eight<S>8083</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> thirty<S>7970</S> and one<S>259</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Jedidah<S>3040</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Adaiah<S>5718</S> of Boscath<S>1218</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and walked<S>3212</S> in all the way<S>1870</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>, and turned not aside<S>5493</S> to the right hand<S>3225</S> or to the left<S>8040</S>.
And it came to pass in the eighteenth<S>8083</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Josiah<S>2977</S>, that the king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S> Shaphan<S>8227</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Azaliah<S>683</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Meshullam<S>4918</S>, the scribe<S>5608</S>, to the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Go up<S>5927</S> to Hilkiah<S>2518</S> the high<S>1419</S> priest<S>3548</S>, that he may sum<S>8552</S> the silver<S>3701</S> which is brought<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which the keepers<S>8104</S> of the door<S>5592</S> have gathered<S>622</S> of the people<S>5971</S>: <sup>door: Heb. threshold</sup>
And let them deliver<S>5414</S> it into the hand<S>3027</S> of the doers<S>6213</S> of the work<S>4399</S>, that have the oversight<S>6485</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and let them give<S>5414</S> it to the doers<S>6213</S> of the work<S>4399</S> which is in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to repair<S>2388</S> the breaches<S>919</S> of the house<S>1004</S>,
Unto carpenters<S>2796</S>, and builders<S>1129</S>, and masons<S>1443</S>, and to buy<S>7069</S> timber<S>6086</S> and hewn<S>4274</S> stone<S>68</S> to repair<S>2388</S> the house<S>1004</S>.
Howbeit there was no reckoning made<S>2803</S> with them of the money<S>3701</S> that was delivered<S>5414</S> into their hand<S>3027</S>, because they dealt<S>6213</S> faithfully<S>530</S>.
And Hilkiah<S>2518</S> the high<S>1419</S> priest<S>3548</S> said<S>559</S> unto Shaphan<S>8227</S> the scribe<S>5608</S>, I have found<S>4672</S> the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. And Hilkiah<S>2518</S> gave<S>5414</S> the book<S>5612</S> to Shaphan<S>8227</S>, and he read<S>7121</S> it.
And Shaphan<S>8227</S> the scribe<S>5608</S> came<S>935</S> to the king<S>4428</S>, and brought<S>7725</S> the king<S>4428</S> word<S>1697</S> again<S>7725</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Thy servants<S>5650</S> have gathered<S>5413</S> the money<S>3701</S> that was found<S>4672</S> in the house<S>1004</S>, and have delivered<S>5414</S> it into the hand<S>3027</S> of them that do<S>6213</S> the work<S>4399</S>, that have the oversight<S>6485</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>gathered: Heb. melted</sup>
And Shaphan<S>8227</S> the scribe<S>5608</S> shewed<S>5046</S> the king<S>4428</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Hilkiah<S>2518</S> the priest<S>3548</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> me a book<S>5612</S>. And Shaphan<S>8227</S> read<S>7121</S> it before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S>.
And it came to pass, when the king<S>4428</S> had heard<S>8085</S> the words<S>1697</S> of the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S>, that he rent<S>7167</S> his clothes<S>899</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Hilkiah<S>2518</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and Ahikam<S>296</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S>, and Achbor<S>5907</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Michaiah<S>4320</S>, and Shaphan<S>8227</S> the scribe<S>5608</S>, and Asahiah<S>6222</S> a servant<S>5650</S> of the king's<S>4428</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Go<S>3212</S> ye, enquire<S>1875</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> for me, and for the people<S>5971</S>, and for all Judah<S>3063</S>, concerning the words<S>1697</S> of this book<S>5612</S> that is found<S>4672</S>: for great<S>1419</S> is the wrath<S>2534</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> that is kindled<S>3341</S> against us, because our fathers<S>1</S> have not hearkened<S>8085</S> unto the words<S>1697</S> of this book<S>5612</S>, to do<S>6213</S> according unto all that which is written<S>3789</S> concerning us.
So Hilkiah<S>2518</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and Ahikam<S>296</S>, and Achbor<S>5907</S>, and Shaphan<S>8227</S>, and Asahiah<S>6222</S>, went<S>3212</S> unto Huldah<S>2468</S> the prophetess<S>5031</S>, the wife<S>802</S> of Shallum<S>7967</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Tikvah<S>8616</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Harhas<S>2745</S>, keeper<S>8104</S> of the wardrobe<S>899</S>; (now she dwelt<S>3427</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> in the college<S>4932</S>;) and they communed<S>1696</S> with her. <sup>wardrobe: Heb. garments</sup> <sup>in the: or, in the second part</sup>
And she said<S>559</S> unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Tell<S>559</S> the man<S>376</S> that sent<S>7971</S> you to me,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Behold, I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon this place<S>4725</S>, and upon the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof, even all the words<S>1697</S> of the book<S>5612</S> which the king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> hath read<S>7121</S>:
Because they have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and have burned incense<S>6999</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, that they might provoke me to anger<S>3707</S> with all the works<S>4639</S> of their hands<S>3027</S>; therefore my wrath<S>2534</S> shall be kindled<S>3341</S> against this place<S>4725</S>, and shall not be quenched<S>3518</S>.
But to the king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> which sent<S>7971</S> you to enquire<S>1875</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, thus shall ye say<S>559</S> to him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, As touching the words<S>1697</S> which thou hast heard<S>8085</S>;
Because thine heart<S>3824</S> was tender<S>7401</S>, and thou hast humbled<S>3665</S> thyself before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, when thou heardest<S>8085</S> what I spake<S>1696</S> against this place<S>4725</S>, and against the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof, that they should become a desolation<S>8047</S> and a curse<S>7045</S>, and hast rent<S>7167</S> thy clothes<S>899</S>, and wept<S>1058</S> before<S>6440</S> me; I also have heard<S>8085</S> thee, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Behold therefore, I will gather<S>622</S> thee unto thy fathers<S>1</S>, and thou shalt be gathered<S>622</S> into thy grave<S>6913</S> in peace<S>7965</S>; and thine eyes<S>5869</S> shall not see<S>7200</S> all the evil<S>7451</S> which I will bring<S>935</S> upon this place<S>4725</S>. And they brought<S>7725</S> the king<S>4428</S> word<S>1697</S> again<S>7725</S>.

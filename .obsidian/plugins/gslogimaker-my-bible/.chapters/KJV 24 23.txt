Woe<S>1945</S> be unto the pastors<S>7462</S> that destroy<S>6</S> and scatter<S>6327</S> the sheep<S>6629</S> of my pasture<S>4830</S>! saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> against the pastors<S>7462</S> that feed<S>7462</S> my people<S>5971</S>; Ye have scattered<S>6327</S> my flock<S>6629</S>, and driven them away<S>5080</S>, and have not visited<S>6485</S> them: behold, I will visit<S>6485</S> upon you the evil<S>7455</S> of your doings<S>4611</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And I will gather<S>6908</S> the remnant<S>7611</S> of my flock<S>6629</S> out of all countries<S>776</S> whither I have driven<S>5080</S> them, and will bring them again<S>7725</S> to their folds<S>5116</S>; and they shall be fruitful<S>6509</S> and increase<S>7235</S>.
And I will set up<S>6965</S> shepherds<S>7462</S> over them which shall feed<S>7462</S> them: and they shall fear<S>3372</S> no more, nor be dismayed<S>2865</S>, neither shall they be lacking<S>6485</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Behold, the days<S>3117</S> come<S>935</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that I will raise<S>6965</S> unto David<S>1732</S> a righteous<S>6662</S> Branch<S>6780</S>, and a King<S>4428</S> shall reign<S>4427</S> and prosper<S>7919</S>, and shall execute<S>6213</S> judgment<S>4941</S> and justice<S>6666</S> in the earth<S>776</S>.
In his days<S>3117</S> Judah<S>3063</S> shall be saved<S>3467</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> shall dwell<S>7931</S> safely<S>983</S>: and this is his name<S>8034</S> whereby he shall be called<S>7121</S>, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS<S>3072</S>. <sup>THE LORD: Heb. Jehovahtsidkenu</sup>
Therefore, behold, the days<S>3117</S> come<S>935</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that they shall no more say<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, which brought up<S>5927</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>;
But, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, which brought up<S>5927</S> and which led<S>935</S> the seed<S>2233</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> out of the north<S>6828</S> country<S>776</S>, and from all countries<S>776</S> whither I had driven<S>5080</S> them; and they shall dwell<S>3427</S> in their own land<S>127</S>.
Mine heart<S>3820</S> within<S>7130</S> me is broken<S>7665</S> because of the prophets<S>5030</S>; all my bones<S>6106</S> shake<S>7363</S>; I am like a drunken<S>7910</S> man<S>376</S>, and like a man<S>1397</S> whom wine<S>3196</S> hath overcome<S>5674</S>, because<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and because of the words<S>1697</S> of his holiness<S>6944</S>.
For the land<S>776</S> is full<S>4390</S> of adulterers<S>5003</S>; for because<S>6440</S> of swearing<S>423</S> the land<S>776</S> mourneth<S>56</S>; the pleasant places<S>4999</S> of the wilderness<S>4057</S> are dried up<S>3001</S>, and their course<S>4794</S> is evil<S>7451</S>, and their force<S>1369</S> is not right. <sup>swearing: or, cursing</sup> <sup>course: or, violence</sup>
For both prophet<S>5030</S> and priest<S>3548</S> are profane<S>2610</S>; yea, in my house<S>1004</S> have I found<S>4672</S> their wickedness<S>7451</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Wherefore their way<S>1870</S> shall be unto them as slippery<S>2519</S> ways in the darkness<S>653</S>: they shall be driven on<S>1760</S>, and fall<S>5307</S> therein: for I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon them, even the year<S>8141</S> of their visitation<S>6486</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And I have seen<S>7200</S> folly<S>8604</S> in the prophets<S>5030</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>; they prophesied<S>5012</S> in Baal<S>1168</S>, and caused my people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S> to err<S>8582</S>. <sup>folly: or, an absurd thing: Heb. unsavoury</sup>
I have seen<S>7200</S> also in the prophets<S>5030</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> an horrible thing<S>8186</S>: they commit adultery<S>5003</S>, and walk<S>1980</S> in lies<S>8267</S>: they strengthen<S>2388</S> also the hands<S>3027</S> of evildoers<S>7489</S>, that none<S>376</S> doth return<S>7725</S> from his wickedness<S>7451</S>: they are all of them unto me as Sodom<S>5467</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof as Gomorrah<S>6017</S>. <sup>an: or, filthiness</sup>
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> concerning the prophets<S>5030</S>; Behold, I will feed<S>398</S> them with wormwood<S>3939</S>, and make them drink<S>8248</S> the water<S>4325</S> of gall<S>7219</S>: for from the prophets<S>5030</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> is profaneness<S>2613</S> gone forth<S>3318</S> into all the land<S>776</S>. <sup>profaneness: or, hypocrisy</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, Hearken<S>8085</S> not unto the words<S>1697</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S> that prophesy<S>5012</S> unto you: they make you vain<S>1891</S>: they speak<S>1696</S> a vision<S>2377</S> of their own heart<S>3820</S>, and not out of the mouth<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
They say<S>559</S> still<S>559</S> unto them that despise<S>5006</S> me, The LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>1696</S>, Ye shall have peace<S>7965</S>; and they say<S>559</S> unto every one that walketh<S>1980</S> after the imagination<S>8307</S> of his own heart<S>3820</S>, No evil<S>7451</S> shall come<S>935</S> upon you. <sup>imagination: or, stubbornness</sup>
For who hath stood<S>5975</S> in the counsel<S>5475</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and hath perceived<S>7200</S> and heard<S>8085</S> his word<S>1697</S>? who hath marked<S>7181</S> his word<S>1697</S>, and heard<S>8085</S> it? <sup>counsel: or, secret</sup>
Behold, a whirlwind<S>5591</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is gone forth<S>3318</S> in fury<S>2534</S>, even a grievous<S>2342</S> whirlwind<S>5591</S>: it shall fall grievously<S>2342</S> upon the head<S>7218</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>.
The anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> shall not return<S>7725</S>, until he have executed<S>6213</S>, and till he have performed<S>6965</S> the thoughts<S>4209</S> of his heart<S>3820</S>: in the latter<S>319</S> days<S>3117</S> ye shall consider<S>995</S> it perfectly<S>998</S>.
I have not sent<S>7971</S> these prophets<S>5030</S>, yet they ran<S>7323</S>: I have not spoken<S>1696</S> to them, yet they prophesied<S>5012</S>.
But if they had stood<S>5975</S> in my counsel<S>5475</S>, and had caused my people<S>5971</S> to hear<S>8085</S> my words<S>1697</S>, then they should have turned<S>7725</S> them from their evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>, and from the evil<S>7455</S> of their doings<S>4611</S>.
Am I a God<S>430</S> at hand<S>7138</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and not a God<S>430</S> afar off<S>7350</S>?
Can any<S>376</S> hide<S>5641</S> himself in secret places<S>4565</S> that I shall not see<S>7200</S> him? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. Do not I fill<S>4392</S> heaven<S>8064</S> and earth<S>776</S>? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
I have heard<S>8085</S> what the prophets<S>5030</S> said<S>559</S>, that prophesy<S>5012</S> lies<S>8267</S> in my name<S>8034</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I have dreamed<S>2492</S>, I have dreamed<S>2492</S>.
How long shall this be<S>3426</S> in the heart<S>3820</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S> that prophesy<S>5012</S> lies<S>8267</S>? yea, they are prophets<S>5030</S> of the deceit<S>8649</S> of their own heart<S>3820</S>;
Which think<S>2803</S> to cause my people<S>5971</S> to forget<S>7911</S> my name<S>8034</S> by their dreams<S>2472</S> which they tell<S>5608</S> every man<S>376</S> to his neighbour<S>7453</S>, as their fathers<S>1</S> have forgotten<S>7911</S> my name<S>8034</S> for Baal<S>1168</S>.
The prophet<S>5030</S> that hath a dream<S>2472</S>, let him tell<S>5608</S> a dream<S>2472</S>; and he that hath my word<S>1697</S>, let him speak<S>1696</S> my word<S>1697</S> faithfully<S>571</S>.

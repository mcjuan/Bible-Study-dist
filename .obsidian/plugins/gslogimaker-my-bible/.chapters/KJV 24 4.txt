If thou wilt return<S>7725</S>, O Israel<S>3478</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, return<S>7725</S> unto me: and if thou wilt put away<S>5493</S> thine abominations<S>8251</S> out of my sight<S>6440</S>, then shalt thou not remove<S>5110</S>.
And thou shalt swear<S>7650</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, in truth<S>571</S>, in judgment<S>4941</S>, and in righteousness<S>6666</S>; and the nations<S>1471</S> shall bless<S>1288</S> themselves in him, and in him shall they glory<S>1984</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> to the men<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, Break up<S>5214</S> your fallow ground<S>5215</S>, and sow<S>2232</S> not among thorns<S>6975</S>.
Circumcise<S>4135</S> yourselves to the LORD<S>3068</S>, and take away<S>5493</S> the foreskins<S>6190</S> of your heart<S>3824</S>, ye men<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: lest my fury<S>2534</S> come forth<S>3318</S> like fire<S>784</S>, and burn<S>1197</S> that none can quench<S>3518</S> it, because<S>6440</S> of the evil<S>7455</S> of your doings<S>4611</S>.
Declare<S>5046</S> ye in Judah<S>3063</S>, and publish<S>8085</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and say<S>559</S>, Blow<S>8628</S> ye the trumpet<S>7782</S> in the land<S>776</S>: cry<S>7121</S>, gather together<S>4390</S>, and say<S>559</S>, Assemble<S>622</S> yourselves, and let us go<S>935</S> into the defenced<S>4013</S> cities<S>5892</S>.
Set up<S>5375</S> the standard<S>5251</S> toward Zion<S>6726</S>: retire<S>5756</S>, stay<S>5975</S> not: for I will bring<S>935</S> evil<S>7451</S> from the north<S>6828</S>, and a great<S>1419</S> destruction<S>7667</S>. <sup>retire: or, strengthen</sup> <sup>destruction: Heb. breaking</sup>
The lion<S>738</S> is come up<S>5927</S> from his thicket<S>5441</S>, and the destroyer<S>7843</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S> is on his way<S>5265</S>; he is gone forth<S>3318</S> from his place<S>4725</S> to make<S>7760</S> thy land<S>776</S> desolate<S>8047</S>; and thy cities<S>5892</S> shall be laid waste<S>5327</S>, without an inhabitant<S>3427</S>.
For this gird<S>2296</S> you with sackcloth<S>8242</S>, lament<S>5594</S> and howl<S>3213</S>: for the fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is not turned back<S>7725</S> from us.
And it shall come to pass at that day<S>3117</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that the heart<S>3820</S> of the king<S>4428</S> shall perish<S>6</S>, and the heart<S>3820</S> of the princes<S>8269</S>; and the priests<S>3548</S> shall be astonished<S>8074</S>, and the prophets<S>5030</S> shall wonder<S>8539</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> I, Ah<S>162</S>, Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>! surely<S>403</S> thou hast greatly<S>5377</S> deceived<S>5377</S> this people<S>5971</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Ye shall have peace<S>7965</S>; whereas the sword<S>2719</S> reacheth<S>5060</S> unto the soul<S>5315</S>.
At that time<S>6256</S> shall it be said<S>559</S> to this people<S>5971</S> and to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, A dry<S>6703</S> wind<S>7307</S> of the high places<S>8205</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> toward<S>1870</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of my people<S>5971</S>, not to fan<S>2219</S>, nor to cleanse<S>1305</S>,
Even a full<S>4392</S> wind<S>7307</S> from those places shall come<S>935</S> unto me: now also will I give<S>1696</S> sentence<S>4941</S> against them. <sup>a full: or, a fuller wind than those</sup> <sup>give: Heb. utter judgments</sup>

O Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, wash<S>3526</S> thine heart<S>3820</S> from wickedness<S>7451</S>, that thou mayest be saved<S>3467</S>. How long shall thy vain<S>205</S> thoughts<S>4284</S> lodge<S>3885</S> within<S>7130</S> thee?

Make ye mention<S>2142</S> to the nations<S>1471</S>; behold, publish<S>8085</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, that watchers<S>5341</S> come<S>935</S> from a far<S>4801</S> country<S>776</S>, and give out<S>5414</S> their voice<S>6963</S> against the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
As keepers<S>8104</S> of a field<S>7704</S>, are they against her round about<S>5439</S>; because she hath been rebellious<S>4784</S> against me, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Thy way<S>1870</S> and thy doings<S>4611</S> have procured<S>6213</S> these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness<S>7451</S>, because it is bitter<S>4751</S>, because it reacheth<S>5060</S> unto thine heart<S>3820</S>.

Destruction<S>7667</S> upon destruction<S>7667</S> is cried<S>7121</S>; for the whole land<S>776</S> is spoiled<S>7703</S>: suddenly<S>6597</S> are my tents<S>168</S> spoiled<S>7703</S>, and my curtains<S>3407</S> in a moment<S>7281</S>.
How long shall I see<S>7200</S> the standard<S>5251</S>, and hear<S>8085</S> the sound<S>6963</S> of the trumpet<S>7782</S>?
For my people<S>5971</S> is foolish<S>191</S>, they have not known<S>3045</S> me; they are sottish<S>5530</S> children<S>1121</S>, and they have none understanding<S>995</S>: they are wise<S>2450</S> to do evil<S>7489</S>, but to do good<S>3190</S> they have no knowledge<S>3045</S>.
I beheld<S>7200</S> the earth<S>776</S>, and, lo, it was without form<S>8414</S>, and void<S>922</S>; and the heavens<S>8064</S>, and they had no light<S>216</S>.
I beheld<S>7200</S> the mountains<S>2022</S>, and, lo, they trembled<S>7493</S>, and all the hills<S>1389</S> moved lightly<S>7043</S>.
I beheld<S>7200</S>, and, lo, there was no man<S>120</S>, and all the birds<S>5775</S> of the heavens<S>8064</S> were fled<S>5074</S>.
I beheld<S>7200</S>, and, lo, the fruitful place<S>3759</S> was a wilderness<S>4057</S>, and all the cities<S>5892</S> thereof were broken down<S>5422</S> at the presence<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and by his fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S>.
For thus hath the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S>, The whole land<S>776</S> shall be desolate<S>8077</S>; yet will I not make<S>6213</S> a full end<S>3617</S>.
For this shall the earth<S>776</S> mourn<S>56</S>, and the heavens<S>8064</S> above<S>4605</S> be black<S>6937</S>: because I have spoken<S>1696</S> it, I have purposed<S>2161</S> it, and will not repent<S>5162</S>, neither will I turn back<S>7725</S> from it.
The whole city<S>5892</S> shall flee<S>1272</S> for the noise<S>6963</S> of the horsemen<S>6571</S> and bowmen<S>7198</S> <S>7411</S>; they shall go<S>935</S> into thickets<S>5645</S>, and climb up<S>5927</S> upon the rocks<S>3710</S>: every city<S>5892</S> shall be forsaken<S>5800</S>, and not a man<S>376</S> dwell<S>3427</S> therein<S>2004</S>.

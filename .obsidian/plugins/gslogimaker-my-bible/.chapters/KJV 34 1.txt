The burden<S>4853</S> of Nineveh<S>5210</S>. The book<S>5612</S> of the vision<S>2377</S> of Nahum<S>5151</S> the Elkoshite<S>512</S>.
God<S>410</S> is jealous<S>7072</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> revengeth<S>5358</S>; the LORD<S>3068</S> revengeth<S>5358</S>, and is furious<S>1167</S> <S>2534</S>; the LORD<S>3068</S> will take vengeance<S>5358</S> on his adversaries<S>6862</S>, and he reserveth<S>5201</S> wrath for his enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>God: or, The LORD is a jealous God, and a revenger, etc</sup> <sup>is furious: Heb. that hath fury</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> is slow<S>750</S> to anger<S>639</S>, and great<S>1419</S> in power<S>3581</S>, and will not at all<S>5352</S> acquit<S>5352</S> the wicked: the LORD<S>3068</S> hath his way<S>1870</S> in the whirlwind<S>5492</S> and in the storm<S>8183</S>, and the clouds<S>6051</S> are the dust<S>80</S> of his feet<S>7272</S>.
He rebuketh<S>1605</S> the sea<S>3220</S>, and maketh it dry<S>2717</S>, and drieth up<S>3001</S> all the rivers<S>5104</S>: Bashan<S>1316</S> languisheth<S>535</S>, and Carmel<S>3760</S>, and the flower<S>6525</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S> languisheth<S>535</S>.
The mountains<S>2022</S> quake<S>7493</S> at him, and the hills<S>1389</S> melt<S>4127</S>, and the earth<S>776</S> is burned<S>5375</S> at his presence<S>6440</S>, yea, the world<S>8398</S>, and all that dwell<S>3427</S> therein.
Who can stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> his indignation<S>2195</S>? and who can abide<S>6965</S> in the fierceness<S>2740</S> of his anger<S>639</S>? his fury<S>2534</S> is poured out<S>5413</S> like fire<S>784</S>, and the rocks<S>6697</S> are thrown down<S>5422</S> by him. <sup>abide: Heb. stand up</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> is good<S>2896</S>, a strong hold<S>4581</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of trouble<S>6869</S>; and he knoweth<S>3045</S> them that trust<S>2620</S> in him. <sup>strong hold: or, strength</sup>
But with an overrunning<S>5674</S> flood<S>7858</S> he will make<S>6213</S> an utter end<S>3617</S> of the place<S>4725</S> thereof, and darkness<S>2822</S> shall pursue<S>7291</S> his enemies<S>341</S>.
What do ye imagine<S>2803</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>? he will make<S>6213</S> an utter end<S>3617</S>: affliction<S>6869</S> shall not rise up<S>6965</S> the second time<S>6471</S>.
For while they be folden together<S>5440</S> as thorns<S>5518</S>, and while they are drunken<S>5433</S> as drunkards<S>5435</S>, they shall be devoured<S>398</S> as stubble<S>7179</S> fully<S>4392</S> dry<S>3002</S>.
There is one come out<S>3318</S> of thee, that imagineth<S>2803</S> evil<S>7451</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>, a wicked<S>1100</S> counsellor<S>3289</S>. <sup>a wicked: Heb. a counsellor of Belial</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Though they be quiet<S>8003</S>, and likewise many<S>7227</S>, yet thus shall they be cut down<S>1494</S>, when he shall pass through<S>5674</S>. Though I have afflicted<S>6031</S> thee, I will afflict<S>6031</S> thee no more. <sup>Though: or, If they would have been at peace, so should they have been many, and so should they have been shorn, and he should have passed away</sup> <sup>cut down: Heb. shorn</sup>
For now will I break<S>7665</S> his yoke<S>4132</S> from off thee, and will burst<S>5423</S> thy bonds<S>4147</S> in sunder<S>5423</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given a commandment<S>6680</S> concerning thee, that no more of thy name<S>8034</S> be sown<S>2232</S>: out of the house<S>1004</S> of thy gods<S>430</S> will I cut off<S>3772</S> the graven image<S>6459</S> and the molten image<S>4541</S>: I will make<S>7760</S> thy grave<S>6913</S>; for thou art vile<S>7043</S>.
Behold upon the mountains<S>2022</S> the feet<S>7272</S> of him that bringeth good tidings<S>1319</S>, that publisheth<S>8085</S> peace<S>7965</S>! O Judah<S>3063</S>, keep<S>2287</S> thy solemn feasts<S>2282</S>, perform<S>7999</S> thy vows<S>5088</S>: for the wicked<S>1100</S> shall no more<S>3254</S> pass through<S>5674</S> thee; he is utterly cut off<S>3772</S>. <sup>keep: Heb. feast</sup> <sup>the wicked: Heb. Belial</sup>

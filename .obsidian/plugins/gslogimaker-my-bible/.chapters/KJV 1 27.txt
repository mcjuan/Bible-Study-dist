And it came to pass<S>1961</S>, that when Isaac<S>3327</S> was old<S>2204</S>, and his eyes<S>5869</S> were dim<S>3543</S>, so that he could not see<S>7200</S>, he called<S>7121</S> Esau<S>6215</S> his eldest<S>1419</S> son<S>1121</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, My son<S>1121</S>: and he said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, here am I.
And he said<S>559</S>, Behold now, I am old<S>2204</S>, I know<S>3045</S> not the day<S>3117</S> of my death<S>4194</S>:
Now therefore take<S>5375</S>, I pray thee, thy weapons<S>3627</S>, thy quiver<S>8522</S> and thy bow<S>7198</S>, and go out<S>3318</S> to the field<S>7704</S>, and take<S>6679</S> me some venison<S>6718</S> <S>6720</S>; <sup>take: Heb. hunt</sup>
And make<S>6213</S> me savoury meat<S>4303</S>, such as<S>834</S> I love<S>157</S>, and bring<S>935</S> it to me, that I may eat<S>398</S>; that my soul<S>5315</S> may bless<S>1288</S> thee before<S>2962</S> I die<S>4191</S>.
And Rebekah<S>7259</S> heard<S>8085</S> when Isaac<S>3327</S> spake<S>1696</S> to Esau<S>6215</S> his son<S>1121</S>. And Esau<S>6215</S> went<S>3212</S> to the field<S>7704</S> to hunt<S>6679</S> for venison<S>6718</S>, and to bring<S>935</S> it.
And Rebekah<S>7259</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S> her son<S>1121</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, I heard<S>8085</S> thy father<S>1</S> speak<S>1696</S> unto Esau<S>6215</S> thy brother<S>251</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Bring<S>935</S> me venison<S>6718</S>, and make<S>6213</S> me savoury meat<S>4303</S>, that I may eat<S>398</S>, and bless<S>1288</S> thee before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> before<S>6440</S> my death<S>4194</S>.
Now therefore, my son<S>1121</S>, obey<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S> according to that which<S>834</S> I command<S>6680</S> thee.
Go<S>3212</S> now to the flock<S>6629</S>, and fetch<S>3947</S> me from thence two<S>8147</S> good<S>2896</S> kids<S>1423</S> of the goats<S>5795</S>; and I will make<S>6213</S> them savoury meat<S>4303</S> for thy father<S>1</S>, such as he loveth<S>157</S>:
And thou shalt bring<S>935</S> it to thy father<S>1</S>, that he may eat<S>398</S>, and that<S>834</S> he may bless<S>1288</S> thee before<S>6440</S> his death<S>4194</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> to Rebekah<S>7259</S> his mother<S>517</S>, Behold, Esau<S>6215</S> my brother<S>251</S> is a hairy<S>8163</S> man<S>376</S>, and I am a smooth<S>2509</S> man<S>376</S>:
My father<S>1</S> peradventure will feel<S>4959</S> me, and I shall seem<S>5869</S> to him as a deceiver<S>8591</S>; and I shall bring<S>935</S> a curse<S>7045</S> upon me, and not a blessing<S>1293</S>.
And his mother<S>517</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Upon me be thy curse<S>7045</S>, my son<S>1121</S>: only obey<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>, and go<S>3212</S> fetch<S>3947</S> me them.
And he went<S>3212</S>, and fetched<S>3947</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them to his mother<S>517</S>: and his mother<S>517</S> made<S>6213</S> savoury meat<S>4303</S>, such as his father<S>1</S> loved<S>157</S>.
And Rebekah<S>7259</S> took<S>3947</S> goodly<S>2532</S> raiment<S>899</S> of her eldest<S>1419</S> son<S>1121</S> Esau<S>6215</S>, which were with her in the house<S>1004</S>, and put them upon<S>3847</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> her younger<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S>: <sup>goodly: Heb. desirable</sup>
And she put<S>3847</S> the skins<S>5785</S> of the kids<S>1423</S> of the goats<S>5795</S> upon his hands<S>3027</S>, and upon the smooth<S>2513</S> of his neck<S>6677</S>:
And she gave<S>5414</S> the savoury meat<S>4303</S> and the bread<S>3899</S>, which she had prepared<S>6213</S>, into the hand<S>3027</S> of her son<S>1121</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>.
And he came<S>935</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, and said<S>559</S>, My father<S>1</S>: and he said<S>559</S>, Here am I; who art thou, my son<S>1121</S>?
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, I am Esau<S>6215</S> thy firstborn<S>1060</S>; I have done<S>6213</S> according as thou badest<S>1696</S> me: arise<S>6965</S>, I pray thee, sit<S>3427</S> and eat<S>398</S> of my venison<S>6718</S>, that thy soul<S>5315</S> may bless<S>1288</S> me.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> said<S>559</S> unto his son<S>1121</S>, How is it that thou hast found<S>4672</S> it so quickly<S>4116</S>, my son<S>1121</S>? And he said<S>559</S>, Because the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> brought<S>7136</S> it to me<S>6440</S>. <sup>to me: Heb. before me</sup>
And Isaac<S>3327</S> said<S>559</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>, Come near<S>5066</S>, I pray thee, that I may feel<S>4184</S> thee, my son<S>1121</S>, whether thou be my very<S>2088</S> son<S>1121</S> Esau<S>6215</S> or not.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> went near<S>5066</S> unto Isaac<S>3327</S> his father<S>1</S>; and he felt<S>4959</S> him, and said<S>559</S>, The voice<S>6963</S> is Jacob's<S>3290</S> voice<S>6963</S>, but the hands<S>3027</S> are the hands<S>3027</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>.
And he discerned<S>5234</S> him not, because his hands<S>3027</S> were hairy<S>8163</S>, as his brother<S>251</S> Esau's<S>6215</S> hands<S>3027</S>: so he blessed<S>1288</S> him.
And he said<S>559</S>, Art thou my very son<S>1121</S> Esau<S>6215</S>? And he said<S>559</S>, I am.
And he said<S>559</S>, Bring it near<S>5066</S> to me, and I will eat<S>398</S> of my son's<S>1121</S> venison<S>6718</S>, that my soul<S>5315</S> may bless<S>1288</S> thee. And he brought it near<S>5066</S> to him, and he did eat<S>398</S>: and he brought<S>935</S> him wine<S>3196</S>, and he drank<S>8354</S>.
And his father<S>1</S> Isaac<S>3327</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Come near<S>5066</S> now, and kiss<S>5401</S> me, my son<S>1121</S>.
And he came near<S>5066</S>, and kissed<S>5401</S> him: and he smelled<S>7306</S> the smell<S>7381</S> of his raiment<S>899</S>, and blessed<S>1288</S> him, and said<S>559</S>, See<S>7200</S>, the smell<S>7381</S> of my son<S>1121</S> is as the smell<S>7381</S> of a field<S>7704</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath blessed<S>1288</S>:
Therefore God<S>430</S> give<S>5414</S> thee of the dew<S>2919</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and the fatness<S>4924</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and plenty<S>7230</S> of corn<S>1715</S> and wine<S>8492</S>:
Let people<S>5971</S> serve<S>5647</S> thee, and nations<S>3816</S> bow down<S>7812</S> to thee: be<S>1933</S> lord<S>1376</S> over thy brethren<S>251</S>, and let thy mother's<S>517</S> sons<S>1121</S> bow down<S>7812</S> to thee: cursed<S>779</S> be every one that curseth<S>779</S> thee, and blessed<S>1288</S> be he that blesseth<S>1288</S> thee.
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac<S>3327</S> had made an end<S>3615</S> of blessing<S>1288</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>, and Jacob<S>3290</S> was yet<S>389</S> scarce<S>3318</S> gone out<S>3318</S> from the presence<S>6440</S> of Isaac<S>3327</S> his father<S>1</S>, that Esau<S>6215</S> his brother<S>251</S> came in<S>935</S> from his hunting<S>6718</S>.
And he also had made<S>6213</S> savoury meat<S>4303</S>, and brought it<S>935</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, Let my father<S>1</S> arise<S>6965</S>, and eat<S>398</S> of his son's<S>1121</S> venison<S>6718</S>, that thy soul<S>5315</S> may bless<S>1288</S> me.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> his father<S>1</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Who art thou? And he said<S>559</S>, I am thy son<S>1121</S>, thy firstborn<S>1060</S> Esau<S>6215</S>.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> trembled<S>2729</S> very<S>1419</S> exceedingly<S>3966</S> <S>2731</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Who? where<S>645</S> is he that hath taken<S>6679</S> venison<S>6718</S>, and brought<S>935</S> it me, and I have eaten<S>398</S> of all before thou camest<S>935</S>, and have blessed<S>1288</S> him? yea, and he shall be blessed<S>1288</S>. <sup>trembled: Heb. trembled with a great trembling greatly</sup> <sup>taken: Heb. hunted</sup>
And when Esau<S>6215</S> heard<S>8085</S> the words<S>1697</S> of his father<S>1</S>, he cried<S>6817</S> with a great<S>1419</S> and exceeding<S>3966</S> bitter<S>4751</S> cry<S>6818</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, Bless<S>1288</S> me, even me also, O my father<S>1</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Thy brother<S>251</S> came<S>935</S> with subtilty<S>4820</S>, and hath taken away<S>3947</S> thy blessing<S>1293</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Is not he rightly<S>3588</S> named<S>7121</S> <S>8034</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>? for he hath supplanted me<S>6117</S> these<S>2088</S> two times<S>6471</S>: he took away<S>3947</S> my birthright<S>1062</S>; and, behold, now he hath taken away<S>3947</S> my blessing<S>1293</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, Hast thou not reserved<S>680</S> a blessing<S>1293</S> for me? <sup>Jacob: that is, A supplanter</sup>
And Isaac<S>3327</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto Esau<S>6215</S>, Behold, I have made<S>7760</S> him thy lord<S>1376</S>, and all his brethren<S>251</S> have I given<S>5414</S> to him for servants<S>5650</S>; and with corn<S>1715</S> and wine<S>8492</S> have I sustained<S>5564</S> him: and what shall I do<S>6213</S> now<S>645</S> unto thee, my son<S>1121</S>? <sup>sustained: or, supported</sup>
And Esau<S>6215</S> said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, Hast thou but one<S>259</S> blessing<S>1293</S>, my father<S>1</S>? bless<S>1288</S> me, even me also, O my father<S>1</S>. And Esau<S>6215</S> lifted up<S>5375</S> his voice<S>6963</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> his father<S>1</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, thy dwelling<S>4186</S> shall be the fatness<S>4924</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and of the dew<S>2919</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> from above<S>5920</S>; <sup>the fatness: or, of the fatness</sup>
And by thy sword<S>2719</S> shalt thou live<S>2421</S>, and shalt serve<S>5647</S> thy brother<S>251</S>; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion<S>7300</S>, that thou shalt break<S>6561</S> his yoke<S>5923</S> from off thy neck<S>6677</S>.
And Esau<S>6215</S> hated<S>7852</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> because<S>5921</S> of the blessing<S>1293</S> wherewith<S>834</S> his father<S>1</S> blessed him<S>1288</S>: and Esau<S>6215</S> said<S>559</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, The days<S>3117</S> of mourning<S>60</S> for my father<S>1</S> are at hand<S>7126</S>; then will I slay<S>2026</S> my brother<S>251</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>.
And these words<S>1697</S> of Esau<S>6215</S> her elder<S>1419</S> son<S>1121</S> were told<S>5046</S> to Rebekah<S>7259</S>: and she sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> her younger<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, thy brother<S>251</S> Esau<S>6215</S>, as touching thee, doth comfort<S>5162</S> himself, purposing to kill<S>2026</S> thee.
Now therefore, my son<S>1121</S>, obey<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S>; and arise<S>6965</S>, flee<S>1272</S> thou to Laban<S>3837</S> my brother<S>251</S> to Haran<S>2771</S>;
And tarry<S>3427</S> with him a few<S>259</S> days<S>3117</S>, until<S>834</S> thy brother's<S>251</S> fury<S>2534</S> turn away<S>7725</S>;
Until thy brother's<S>251</S> anger<S>639</S> turn away<S>7725</S> from thee, and he forget<S>7911</S> that which thou hast done<S>6213</S> to him: then I will send<S>7971</S>, and fetch<S>3947</S> thee from thence: why<S>4100</S> should I be deprived<S>7921</S> also of you both<S>8147</S> in one<S>259</S> day<S>3117</S>?
And Rebekah<S>7259</S> said<S>559</S> to Isaac<S>3327</S>, I am weary<S>6973</S> of my life<S>2416</S> because<S>6440</S> of the daughters<S>1323</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>: if Jacob<S>3290</S> take<S>3947</S> a wife<S>802</S> of the daughters<S>1323</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>, such as these which are of the daughters<S>1323</S> of the land<S>776</S>, what good<S>4100</S> shall my life<S>2416</S> do me?

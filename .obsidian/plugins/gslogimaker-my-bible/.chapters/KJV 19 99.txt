The king's<S>4428</S> strength<S>5797</S> also loveth<S>157</S> judgment<S>4941</S>; thou dost establish<S>3559</S> equity<S>4339</S>, thou executest<S>6213</S> judgment<S>4941</S> and righteousness<S>6666</S> in Jacob<S>3290</S>.
Exalt<S>7311</S> ye the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, and worship<S>7812</S> at his footstool<S>7272</S> <S>1916</S>; for he is holy<S>6918</S>. <sup>he is: or, it is holy</sup>
Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> among his priests<S>3548</S>, and Samuel<S>8050</S> among them that call<S>7121</S> upon his name<S>8034</S>; they called<S>7121</S> upon the LORD<S>3068</S>, and he answered<S>6030</S> them.
He spake<S>1696</S> unto them in the cloudy<S>6051</S> pillar<S>5982</S>: they kept<S>8104</S> his testimonies<S>5713</S>, and the ordinance<S>2706</S> that he gave<S>5414</S> them.
Thou answeredst<S>6030</S> them, O LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>: thou wast a God<S>410</S> that forgavest<S>5375</S> them, though thou tookest vengeance<S>5358</S> of their inventions<S>5949</S>.
Exalt<S>7311</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, and worship<S>7812</S> at his holy<S>6944</S> hill<S>2022</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> is holy<S>6918</S>.

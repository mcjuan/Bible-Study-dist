And the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me came again<S>7725</S>, and waked<S>5782</S> me, as a man<S>376</S> that is wakened<S>5782</S> out of his sleep<S>8142</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto me, What seest<S>7200</S> thou? And I said<S>559</S>, I have looked<S>7200</S>, and behold a candlestick<S>4501</S> all of gold<S>2091</S>, with a bowl<S>1531</S> upon the top<S>7218</S> of it, and his seven<S>7651</S> lamps<S>5216</S> thereon, and seven<S>7651</S> pipes<S>4166</S> to the seven<S>7651</S> lamps<S>5216</S>, which are upon the top<S>7218</S> thereof: <sup>a bowl: Heb. her bowl</sup> <sup>seven pipes: or, seven several pipes to the lamps</sup>
And two<S>8147</S> olive trees<S>2132</S> by it, one<S>259</S> upon the right<S>3225</S> side of the bowl<S>1543</S>, and the other<S>259</S> upon the left<S>8040</S> side thereof.
So I answered<S>6030</S> and spake<S>559</S> to the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me, saying<S>559</S>, What are these, my lord<S>113</S>?
Then the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto me, Knowest<S>3045</S> thou not what these be? And I said<S>559</S>, No, my lord<S>113</S>.
Then he answered<S>6030</S> and spake<S>559</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>, This is the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto Zerubbabel<S>2216</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Not by might<S>2428</S>, nor by power<S>3581</S>, but by my spirit<S>7307</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>. <sup>might: or, army</sup>
Who art thou, O great<S>1419</S> mountain<S>2022</S>? before<S>6440</S> Zerubbabel<S>2216</S> thou shalt become a plain<S>4334</S>: and he shall bring forth<S>3318</S> the headstone<S>68</S> <S>7222</S> thereof with shoutings<S>8663</S>, crying, Grace<S>2580</S>, grace<S>2580</S> unto it.
Moreover the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
The hands<S>3027</S> of Zerubbabel<S>2216</S> have laid the foundation<S>3245</S> of this house<S>1004</S>; his hands<S>3027</S> shall also finish<S>1214</S> it; and thou shalt know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> me unto you.
For who hath despised<S>936</S> the day<S>3117</S> of small things<S>6996</S>? for they shall rejoice<S>8055</S>, and shall see<S>7200</S> the plummet<S>68</S> <S>913</S> in the hand<S>3027</S> of Zerubbabel<S>2216</S> with those seven<S>7651</S>; they are the eyes<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which run to and fro<S>7751</S> through the whole earth<S>776</S>. <sup>for they: or, since the seven eyes of the Lord shall rejoice</sup> <sup>plummet: Heb. stone of tin</sup>
Then answered<S>6030</S> I, and said<S>559</S> unto him, What are these two<S>8147</S> olive trees<S>2132</S> upon the right<S>3225</S> side of the candlestick<S>4501</S> and upon the left<S>8040</S> side thereof?
And I answered<S>6030</S> again<S>8145</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, What be these two<S>8147</S> olive<S>2132</S> branches<S>7641</S> which through<S>3027</S> the two<S>8147</S> golden<S>2091</S> pipes<S>6804</S> empty<S>7324</S> the golden<S>2091</S> oil out of themselves? <sup>through: Heb. by the hand</sup> <sup>empty: or, empty out of themselves oil into the gold</sup> <sup>the golden oil: Heb. the gold</sup>
And he answered<S>559</S> me and said<S>559</S>, Knowest<S>3045</S> thou not what these be? And I said<S>559</S>, No, my lord<S>113</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> he, These are the two<S>8147</S> anointed<S>3323</S> ones<S>1121</S>, that stand<S>5975</S> by the Lord<S>113</S> of the whole earth<S>776</S>. <sup>anointed: Heb. sons of oil</sup>
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.</J> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

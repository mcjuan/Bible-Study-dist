They have corrupted<S>7843</S> themselves, their spot<S>3971</S> is not the spot of his children<S>1121</S>: they are a perverse<S>6141</S> and crooked<S>6618</S> generation<S>1755</S>. <sup>They have: Heb.

For the LORD'S<S>3068</S> portion<S>2506</S> is his people<S>5971</S>; Jacob<S>3290</S> is the lot<S>2256</S> of his inheritance<S>5159</S>. <sup>lot: Heb. cord</sup>

So the LORD<S>3068</S> alone<S>910</S> did lead<S>5148</S> him, and there was no strange<S>5236</S> god<S>410</S> with him.

But Jeshurun<S>3484</S> waxed fat<S>8080</S>, and kicked<S>1163</S>: thou art waxen fat<S>8080</S>, thou art grown thick<S>5666</S>, thou art covered<S>3780</S> with fatness; then he forsook<S>5203</S> God<S>433</S> which made<S>6213</S> him, and lightly esteemed<S>5034</S> the Rock<S>6697</S> of his salvation<S>3444</S>.
They provoked him to jealousy<S>7065</S> with strange<S>2114</S> gods, with abominations<S>8441</S> provoked they him to anger<S>3707</S>.
They sacrificed<S>2076</S> unto devils<S>7700</S>, not to God<S>433</S>; to gods<S>430</S> whom they knew<S>3045</S> not, to new<S>2319</S> gods that came<S>935</S> newly<S>7138</S> up<S>935</S>, whom your fathers<S>1</S> feared<S>8175</S> not. <sup>not to: or, which were not God</sup>

Then Moab<S>4124</S> rebelled<S>6586</S> against Israel<S>3478</S> after<S>310</S> the death<S>4194</S> of Ahab<S>256</S>.
And Ahaziah<S>274</S> fell down<S>5307</S> through a lattice<S>7639</S> in his upper chamber<S>5944</S> that was in Samaria<S>8111</S>, and was sick<S>2470</S>: and he sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Go<S>3212</S>, enquire<S>1875</S> of Baalzebub<S>1176</S> the god<S>430</S> of Ekron<S>6138</S> whether I shall recover<S>2421</S> of this disease<S>2483</S>.
But the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> to Elijah<S>452</S> the Tishbite<S>8664</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, go up<S>5927</S> to meet<S>7125</S> the messengers<S>4397</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>, and say<S>1696</S> unto them, Is it not because there is not a God<S>430</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, that ye go<S>1980</S> to enquire<S>1875</S> of Baalzebub<S>1176</S> the god<S>430</S> of Ekron<S>6138</S>?
Now therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Thou shalt not come down<S>3381</S> from that bed<S>4296</S> on which thou art gone up<S>5927</S>, but shalt surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>. And Elijah<S>452</S> departed<S>3212</S>. <sup>Thou shalt: Heb. The bed whither thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it</sup>
And when the messengers<S>4397</S> turned back<S>7725</S> unto him, he said<S>559</S> unto them, Why are ye now<S>2088</S> turned back<S>7725</S>?
And they said<S>559</S> unto him, There came<S>5927</S> a man<S>376</S> up<S>5927</S> to meet<S>7125</S> us, and said<S>559</S> unto us, Go<S>3212</S>, turn again<S>7725</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> that sent<S>7971</S> you, and say<S>1696</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Is it not because there is not a God<S>430</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, that thou sendest<S>7971</S> to enquire<S>1875</S> of Baalzebub<S>1176</S> the god<S>430</S> of Ekron<S>6138</S>? therefore thou shalt not come down<S>3381</S> from that bed<S>4296</S> on which thou art gone up<S>5927</S>, but shalt surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>.
And he said<S>1696</S> unto them, What manner<S>4941</S> of man<S>376</S> was he which came up<S>5927</S> to meet<S>7125</S> you, and told<S>1696</S> you these words<S>1697</S>? <sup>What: Heb. What was the manner of the man</sup>
And they answered<S>559</S> him, He was an hairy<S>8181</S> man<S>1167</S> <S>376</S>, and girt<S>247</S> with a girdle<S>232</S> of leather<S>5785</S> about his loins<S>4975</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, It is Elijah<S>452</S> the Tishbite<S>8664</S>.
Then the king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S> unto him a captain<S>8269</S> of fifty<S>2572</S> with his fifty<S>2572</S>. And he went up<S>5927</S> to him: and, behold, he sat<S>3427</S> on the top<S>7218</S> of an hill<S>2022</S>. And he spake<S>1696</S> unto him, Thou man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, the king<S>4428</S> hath said<S>1696</S>, Come down<S>3381</S>.
And Elijah<S>452</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>1696</S> to the captain<S>8269</S> of fifty<S>2572</S>, If I be a man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, then let fire<S>784</S> come down<S>3381</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and consume<S>398</S> thee and thy fifty<S>2572</S>. And there came down<S>3381</S> fire<S>784</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and consumed<S>398</S> him and his fifty<S>2572</S>.
Again<S>7725</S> also he sent<S>7971</S> unto him another<S>312</S> captain<S>8269</S> of fifty<S>2572</S> with his fifty<S>2572</S>. And he answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>1696</S> unto him, O man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, thus hath the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Come down<S>3381</S> quickly<S>4120</S>.
And Elijah<S>452</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>1696</S> unto them, If I be a man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, let fire<S>784</S> come down<S>3381</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and consume<S>398</S> thee and thy fifty<S>2572</S>. And the fire<S>784</S> of God<S>430</S> came down<S>3381</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and consumed<S>398</S> him and his fifty<S>2572</S>.
And he sent<S>7971</S> again<S>7725</S> a captain<S>8269</S> of the third<S>7992</S> fifty<S>2572</S> with his fifty<S>2572</S>. And the third<S>7992</S> captain<S>8269</S> of fifty<S>2572</S> went up<S>5927</S>, and came<S>935</S> and fell<S>3766</S> on his knees<S>1290</S> before<S>5048</S> Elijah<S>452</S>, and besought<S>2603</S> him, and said<S>1696</S> unto him, O man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, I pray thee, let my life<S>5315</S>, and the life<S>5315</S> of these fifty<S>2572</S> thy servants<S>5650</S>, be precious<S>3365</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>. <sup>fell: Heb. bowed</sup>
Behold, there came<S>3381</S> fire<S>784</S> down<S>3381</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and burnt up<S>398</S> the two<S>8147</S> captains<S>8269</S> of the former<S>7223</S> fifties<S>2572</S> with their fifties<S>2572</S>: therefore let my life<S>5315</S> now be precious<S>3365</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>.
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> unto Elijah<S>452</S>, Go down<S>3381</S> with him: be not afraid<S>3372</S> of him<S>6440</S>. And he arose<S>6965</S>, and went down<S>3381</S> with him unto the king<S>4428</S>.
And he said<S>1696</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Forasmuch as thou hast sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to enquire<S>1875</S> of Baalzebub<S>1176</S> the god<S>430</S> of Ekron<S>6138</S>, is it not because there is no God<S>430</S> in Israel<S>3478</S> to enquire<S>1875</S> of his word<S>1697</S>? therefore thou shalt not come down<S>3381</S> off that bed<S>4296</S> on which thou art gone up<S>5927</S>, but shalt surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>.
So he died<S>4191</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> which Elijah<S>452</S> had spoken<S>1696</S>. And Jehoram<S>3088</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead in the second<S>8147</S> year<S>8141</S> of Jehoram<S>3088</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>; because he had no son<S>1121</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S> which he did<S>6213</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?

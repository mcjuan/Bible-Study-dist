Woe<S>1945</S> to them that devise<S>2803</S> iniquity<S>205</S>, and work<S>6466</S> evil<S>7451</S> upon their beds<S>4904</S>! when the morning<S>1242</S> is light<S>216</S>, they practise<S>6213</S> it, because it is<S>3426</S> in the power<S>410</S> of their hand<S>3027</S>.
And they covet<S>2530</S> fields<S>7704</S>, and take them by violence<S>1497</S>; and houses<S>1004</S>, and take them away<S>5375</S>: so they oppress<S>6231</S> a man<S>1397</S> and his house<S>1004</S>, even a man<S>376</S> and his heritage<S>5159</S>. <sup>oppress: or, defraud</sup>
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Behold, against this family<S>4940</S> do I devise<S>2803</S> an evil<S>7451</S>, from which ye shall not remove<S>4185</S> your necks<S>6677</S>; neither shall ye go<S>3212</S> haughtily<S>7317</S>: for this time<S>6256</S> is evil<S>7451</S>.
In that day<S>3117</S> shall one take up<S>5375</S> a parable<S>4912</S> against you, and lament<S>5091</S> with a doleful<S>5093</S> lamentation<S>5092</S>, and say<S>559</S>, We be utterly<S>7703</S> spoiled<S>7703</S>: he hath changed<S>4171</S> the portion<S>2506</S> of my people<S>5971</S>: how hath he removed<S>4185</S> it from me! turning away<S>7725</S> he hath divided<S>2505</S> our fields<S>7704</S>. <sup>a doleful: Heb. a lamentation of lamentations</sup> <sup>turning: or, instead of restoring</sup>
Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast<S>7993</S> a cord<S>2256</S> by lot<S>1486</S> in the congregation<S>6951</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Prophesy<S>5197</S> ye not, say they to them that prophesy<S>5197</S>: they shall not prophesy<S>5197</S> to them, that they shall not take<S>5253</S> shame<S>3639</S>. <sup>Prophesy ye: or, Prophesy not as they prophesy: Heb. Drop, etc</sup>
O thou that art named<S>559</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, is the spirit<S>7307</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> straitened<S>7114</S>? are these his doings<S>4611</S>? do not my words<S>1697</S> do good<S>3190</S> to him that walketh<S>1980</S> uprightly<S>3477</S>? <sup>straitened: or, shortened?</sup> <sup>uprightly: Heb. upright?</sup>
Even of late<S>865</S> my people<S>5971</S> is risen up<S>6965</S> as an enemy<S>341</S>: ye pull off<S>6584</S> the robe<S>145</S> with<S>4136</S> the garment<S>8008</S> from them that pass<S>5674</S> by securely<S>983</S> as men averse<S>7725</S> from war<S>4421</S>. <sup>of late: Heb. yesterday</sup> <sup>with the: Heb. over against a</sup>
The women<S>802</S> of my people<S>5971</S> have ye cast out<S>1644</S> from their pleasant<S>8588</S> houses<S>1004</S>; from their children<S>5768</S> have ye taken away<S>3947</S> my glory<S>1926</S> for ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>women: or, wives</sup>
Arise<S>6965</S> ye, and depart<S>3212</S>; for this is not your rest<S>4496</S>: because it is polluted<S>2930</S>, it shall destroy<S>2254</S> you, even with a sore<S>4834</S> destruction<S>2256</S>.
If<S>3863</S> a man<S>376</S> walking<S>1980</S> in the spirit<S>7307</S> and falsehood<S>8267</S> do lie<S>3576</S>, saying, I will prophesy<S>5197</S> unto thee of wine<S>3196</S> and of strong drink<S>7941</S>; he shall even be the prophet<S>5197</S> of this people<S>5971</S>. <sup>walking: or, walk with the wind, and lie falsely</sup>
I will surely<S>622</S> assemble<S>622</S>, O Jacob<S>3290</S>, all of thee; I will surely<S>6908</S> gather<S>6908</S> the remnant<S>7611</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; I will put<S>7760</S> them together<S>3162</S> as the sheep<S>6629</S> of Bozrah<S>1223</S> <S>1224</S>, as the flock<S>5739</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of their fold<S>1699</S>: they shall make great noise<S>1949</S> by reason of the multitude of men<S>120</S>.
The breaker<S>6555</S> is come up<S>5927</S> before<S>6440</S> them: they have broken up<S>6555</S>, and have passed through<S>5674</S> the gate<S>8179</S>, and are gone out<S>3318</S> by it: and their king<S>4428</S> shall pass<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> them, and the LORD<S>3068</S> on the head<S>7218</S> of them.

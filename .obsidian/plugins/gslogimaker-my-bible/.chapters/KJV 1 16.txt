Now Sarai<S>8297</S> Abram's<S>87</S> wife<S>802</S> bare<S>3205</S> him no<S>3808</S> children<S>3205</S>: and she had an handmaid<S>8198</S>, an Egyptian<S>4713</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Hagar<S>1904</S>.
And Sarai<S>8297</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abram<S>87</S>, Behold now, the LORD<S>3068</S> hath restrained me<S>6113</S> from bearing<S>3205</S>: I pray thee, go in<S>935</S> unto my maid<S>8198</S>; it may<S>194</S> be that I may obtain children<S>1129</S> by her. And Abram<S>87</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> to the voice<S>6963</S> of Sarai<S>8297</S>. <sup>obtain: Heb. be built by her</sup>
And Sarai<S>8297</S> Abram's<S>87</S> wife<S>802</S> took<S>3947</S> Hagar<S>1904</S> her maid<S>8198</S> the Egyptian<S>4713</S>, after<S>7093</S> Abram<S>87</S> had dwelt<S>3427</S> ten<S>6235</S> years<S>8141</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> her to her husband<S>376</S> Abram<S>87</S> to be his wife<S>802</S>.
And he went in<S>935</S> unto Hagar<S>1904</S>, and she conceived<S>2029</S>: and when she saw<S>7200</S> that she had conceived<S>2029</S>, her mistress<S>1404</S> was despised<S>7043</S> in her eyes<S>5869</S>.
And Sarai<S>8297</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abram<S>87</S>, My wrong<S>2555</S> be upon thee: I have given<S>5414</S> my maid<S>8198</S> into thy bosom<S>2436</S>; and when she saw<S>7200</S> that she had conceived<S>2029</S>, I was despised<S>7043</S> in her eyes<S>5869</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> judge<S>8199</S> between me and thee.
But Abram<S>87</S> said<S>559</S> unto Sarai<S>8297</S>, Behold, thy maid<S>8198</S> is in thy hand<S>3027</S>; do<S>6213</S> to her as it pleaseth thee<S>2896</S> <S>5869</S>. And when Sarai<S>8297</S> dealt hardly with<S>6031</S> her, she fled<S>1272</S> from her face<S>6440</S>. <sup>as: Heb. that which is good in thine eyes</sup> <sup>dealt: Heb. afflicted her</sup>
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> found her<S>4672</S> by a fountain<S>5869</S> of water<S>4325</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, by the fountain<S>5869</S> in the way<S>1870</S> to Shur<S>7793</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Hagar<S>1904</S>, Sarai's<S>8297</S> maid<S>8198</S>, whence<S>335</S> camest thou<S>935</S>? and whither wilt thou go<S>3212</S>? And she said<S>559</S>, I flee<S>1272</S> from the face<S>6440</S> of my mistress<S>1404</S> Sarai<S>8297</S>.
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Return<S>7725</S> to thy mistress<S>1404</S>, and submit<S>6031</S> thyself under her hands<S>3027</S>.
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, I will multiply<S>7235</S> thy seed<S>2233</S> exceedingly<S>7235</S>, that it shall not be numbered<S>5608</S> for multitude<S>7230</S>.
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Behold<S>2009</S>, thou art with child<S>2030</S>, and shalt bear<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and shalt call<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S>; because the LORD<S>3068</S> hath heard<S>8085</S> thy affliction<S>6040</S>. <sup>Ishmael: that is, God shall hear</sup>
And he will be a wild<S>6501</S> man<S>120</S>; his hand<S>3027</S> will be against every man, and every man's hand<S>3027</S> against him; and he shall dwell<S>7931</S> in the presence<S>6440</S> of all his brethren<S>251</S>.
And she called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> that spake<S>1696</S> unto her, Thou God<S>410</S> seest me<S>7210</S>: for she said<S>559</S>, Have I also here<S>1988</S> looked<S>7200</S> after him<S>310</S> that seeth me<S>7210</S>?
Wherefore the well<S>875</S> was called<S>7121</S> Beerlahairoi<S>883</S> <S>2416</S>; behold, it is between Kadesh<S>6946</S> and Bered<S>1260</S>. <sup>Beerlahairoi: that is, The well of him that liveth and seeth me</sup>
And Hagar<S>1904</S> bare<S>3205</S> Abram<S>87</S> a son<S>1121</S>: and Abram<S>87</S> called<S>7121</S> his son's<S>1121</S> name<S>8034</S>, which Hagar<S>1904</S> bare<S>3205</S>, Ishmael<S>3458</S>.
And Abram<S>87</S> was fourscore<S>8084</S> <S>8141</S> and six<S>8337</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, when Hagar<S>1904</S> bare<S>3205</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> to Abram<S>87</S>.

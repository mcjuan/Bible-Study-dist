In the second<S>8147</S> year<S>8141</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3099</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> reigned<S>4427</S> Amaziah<S>558</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
He was twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and nine<S>8672</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Jehoaddan<S>3086</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, yet<S>7535</S> not like David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>: he did<S>6213</S> according to all things as Joash<S>3101</S> his father<S>1</S> did<S>6213</S>.
Howbeit the high places<S>1116</S> were not taken away<S>5493</S>: as yet<S>5750</S> the people<S>5971</S> did sacrifice<S>2076</S> and burnt incense<S>6999</S> on the high places<S>1116</S>.
And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom<S>4467</S> was confirmed<S>2388</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>, that he slew<S>5221</S> his servants<S>5650</S> which had slain<S>5221</S> the king<S>4428</S> his father<S>1</S>.
But the children<S>1121</S> of the murderers<S>5221</S> he slew<S>4191</S> not: according unto that which is written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>, wherein the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The fathers<S>1</S> shall not be put to death<S>4191</S> for the children<S>1121</S>, nor the children<S>1121</S> be put to death<S>4191</S> for the fathers<S>1</S>; but every man<S>376</S> shall be put to death<S>4191</S> for his own sin<S>2399</S>.
He slew<S>5221</S> of Edom<S>123</S> in the valley<S>1516</S> of salt<S>4417</S> ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S>, and took<S>8610</S> Selah<S>5554</S> by war<S>4421</S>, and called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of it Joktheel<S>3371</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>Selah: or, the rock</sup>
Then Amaziah<S>558</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to Jehoash<S>3060</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> son<S>1121</S> of Jehu<S>3058</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Come<S>3212</S>, let us look<S>7200</S> one another in the face<S>6440</S>.
And Jehoash<S>3060</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> sent<S>7971</S> to Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The thistle<S>2336</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S> sent<S>7971</S> to the cedar<S>730</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Give<S>5414</S> thy daughter<S>1323</S> to my son<S>1121</S> to wife<S>802</S>: and there passed<S>5674</S> by a wild<S>7704</S> beast<S>2416</S> that was in Lebanon<S>3844</S>, and trode down<S>7429</S> the thistle<S>2336</S>.
Thou hast indeed<S>5221</S> smitten<S>5221</S> Edom<S>123</S>, and thine heart<S>3820</S> hath lifted thee up<S>5375</S>: glory<S>3513</S> of this, and tarry<S>3427</S> at home<S>1004</S>: for why shouldest thou meddle<S>1624</S> to thy hurt<S>7451</S>, that thou shouldest fall<S>5307</S>, even thou, and Judah<S>3063</S> with thee? <sup>at home: Heb. at thy house</sup>
But Amaziah<S>558</S> would not hear<S>8085</S>. Therefore Jehoash<S>3060</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went up<S>5927</S>; and he and Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> looked<S>7200</S> one another in the face<S>6440</S> at Bethshemesh<S>1053</S>, which belongeth to Judah<S>3063</S>.
And Judah<S>3063</S> was put to the worse<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>; and they fled<S>5127</S> every man<S>376</S> to their tents<S>168</S>. <sup>put: Heb. smitten</sup>
And Jehoash<S>3060</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> took<S>8610</S> Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoash<S>3060</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S>, at Bethshemesh<S>1053</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and brake down<S>6555</S> the wall<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> from the gate<S>8179</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> unto the corner<S>6438</S> gate<S>8179</S>, four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> cubits<S>520</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> all the gold<S>2091</S> and silver<S>3701</S>, and all the vessels<S>3627</S> that were found<S>4672</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and in the treasures<S>214</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, and hostages<S>1121</S> <S>8594</S>, and returned<S>7725</S> to Samaria<S>8111</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Jehoash<S>3060</S> which he did<S>6213</S>, and his might<S>1369</S>, and how he fought<S>3898</S> with Amaziah<S>558</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?
And Jehoash<S>3060</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S> with the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; and Jeroboam<S>3379</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
And Amaziah<S>558</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> lived<S>2421</S> after<S>310</S> the death<S>4194</S> of Jehoash<S>3060</S> son<S>1121</S> of Jehoahaz<S>3059</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> fifteen<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Amaziah<S>558</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>?
Now they made<S>7194</S> a conspiracy<S>7195</S> against him in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: and he fled<S>5127</S> to Lachish<S>3923</S>; but they sent<S>7971</S> after<S>310</S> him to Lachish<S>3923</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> him there.
And they brought<S>5375</S> him on horses<S>5483</S>: and he was buried<S>6912</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with his fathers<S>1</S> in the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>.
And all the people<S>5971</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> took<S>3947</S> Azariah<S>5838</S>, which was sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, and made him king<S>4427</S> instead of his father<S>1</S> Amaziah<S>558</S>.
He built<S>1129</S> Elath<S>359</S>, and restored<S>7725</S> it to Judah<S>3063</S>, after<S>310</S> that the king<S>4428</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>.
In the fifteenth<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> <S>8141</S> year<S>8141</S> of Amaziah<S>558</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> began to reign<S>4427</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S>, and reigned forty<S>705</S> and one<S>259</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: he departed<S>5493</S> not from all the sins<S>2403</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S>, who made Israel<S>3478</S> to sin<S>2398</S>.
He restored<S>7725</S> the coast<S>1366</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> from the entering<S>935</S> of Hamath<S>2574</S> unto the sea<S>3220</S> of the plain<S>6160</S>, according to the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which he spake<S>1696</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of his servant<S>5650</S> Jonah<S>3124</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Amittai<S>573</S>, the prophet<S>5030</S>, which was of Gathhepher<S>1662</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> saw<S>7200</S> the affliction<S>6040</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that it was very<S>3966</S> bitter<S>4784</S>: for there was not<S>657</S> any shut up<S>6113</S>, nor any left<S>5800</S>, nor any helper<S>5826</S> for Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> not that he would blot out<S>4229</S> the name<S>8034</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> from under heaven<S>8064</S>: but he saved<S>3467</S> them by the hand<S>3027</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, and his might<S>1369</S>, how he warred<S>3898</S>, and how he recovered<S>7725</S> Damascus<S>1834</S>, and Hamath<S>2574</S>, which belonged to Judah<S>3063</S>, for Israel<S>3478</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?
And Jeroboam<S>3379</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, even with the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; and Zachariah<S>2148</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.

And Joshua<S>3091</S> rose early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>; and they removed<S>5265</S> from Shittim<S>7851</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Jordan<S>3383</S>, he and all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and lodged<S>3885</S> there before they passed over<S>5674</S>.
And it came to pass after<S>7097</S> three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>, that the officers<S>7860</S> went<S>5674</S> through<S>7130</S> the host<S>4264</S>;
And they commanded<S>6680</S> the people<S>5971</S>, saying<S>559</S>, When ye see<S>7200</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> bearing<S>5375</S> it, then ye shall remove<S>5265</S> from your place<S>4725</S>, and go<S>1980</S> after<S>310</S> it.
Yet there shall be a space<S>7350</S> between you and it, about two thousand<S>505</S> cubits<S>520</S> by measure<S>4060</S>: come not near<S>7126</S> unto it, that ye may know<S>3045</S> the way<S>1870</S> by which ye must go<S>3212</S>: for ye have not passed<S>5674</S> this way<S>1870</S> heretofore<S>8543</S> <S>8032</S>. <sup>heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, and the third day</sup>
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Sanctify<S>6942</S> yourselves: for to morrow<S>4279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> will do<S>6213</S> wonders<S>6381</S> among<S>7130</S> you.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> spake<S>559</S> unto the priests<S>3548</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Take up<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, and pass over<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S>. And they took up<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, and went<S>3212</S> before<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, This day<S>3117</S> will I begin<S>2490</S> to magnify<S>1431</S> thee in the sight<S>5869</S> of all Israel<S>3478</S>, that they may know<S>3045</S> that, as I was with Moses<S>4872</S>, so I will be with thee.
And thou shalt command<S>6680</S> the priests<S>3548</S> that bear<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, saying<S>559</S>, When ye are come<S>935</S> to the brink<S>7097</S> of the water<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, ye shall stand still<S>5975</S> in Jordan<S>3383</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Come hither<S>5066</S>, and hear<S>8085</S> the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S>, Hereby ye shall know<S>3045</S> that the living<S>2416</S> God<S>410</S> is among<S>7130</S> you, and that he will without fail<S>3423</S> drive out<S>3423</S> from before<S>6440</S> you the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, and the Hittites<S>2850</S>, and the Hivites<S>2340</S>, and the Perizzites<S>6522</S>, and the Girgashites<S>1622</S>, and the Amorites<S>567</S>, and the Jebusites<S>2983</S>.
Behold, the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the Lord<S>113</S> of all the earth<S>776</S> passeth over<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> you into Jordan<S>3383</S>.
Now therefore take<S>3947</S> you twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> men<S>376</S> out of the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, out of every<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S> a man<S>376</S>.
And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles<S>3709</S> of the feet<S>7272</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> that bear<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, the Lord<S>113</S> of all the earth<S>776</S>, shall rest<S>5117</S> in the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, that the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> shall be cut off<S>3772</S> from the waters<S>4325</S> that come down<S>3381</S> from above<S>4605</S>; and they shall stand<S>5975</S> upon an<S>259</S> heap<S>5067</S>.
And it came to pass, when the people<S>5971</S> removed<S>5265</S> from their tents<S>168</S>, to pass over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> bearing<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> before<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S>;
And as they that bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> were come<S>935</S> unto Jordan<S>3383</S>, and the feet<S>7272</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> that bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> were dipped<S>2881</S> in the brim<S>7097</S> of the water<S>4325</S>, (for Jordan<S>3383</S> overfloweth<S>4390</S> all his banks<S>1415</S> all the time<S>3117</S> of harvest<S>7105</S>,)
That the waters<S>4325</S> which came down<S>3381</S> from above<S>4605</S> stood<S>5975</S> and rose up<S>6965</S> upon an<S>259</S> heap<S>5067</S> very<S>3966</S> far<S>7368</S> from the city<S>5892</S> Adam<S>121</S>, that is beside<S>6654</S> Zaretan<S>6891</S>: and those that came down<S>3381</S> toward the sea<S>3220</S> of the plain<S>6160</S>, even the salt<S>4417</S> sea<S>3220</S>, failed<S>8552</S>, and were cut off<S>3772</S>: and the people<S>5971</S> passed over<S>5674</S> right against Jericho<S>3405</S>.
And the priests<S>3548</S> that bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> stood<S>5975</S> firm<S>3559</S> on dry ground<S>2724</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, and all the Israelites<S>3478</S> passed over<S>5674</S> on dry ground<S>2724</S>, until all the people<S>1471</S> were passed<S>5674</S> clean<S>8552</S> over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>.

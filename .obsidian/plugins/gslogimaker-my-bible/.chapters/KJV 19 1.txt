Blessed<S>835</S> is the man<S>376</S> that walketh<S>1980</S> not in the counsel<S>6098</S> of the ungodly<S>7563</S>, nor standeth<S>5975</S> in the way<S>1870</S> of sinners<S>2400</S>, nor sitteth<S>3427</S> in the seat<S>4186</S> of the scornful<S>3887</S>. <sup>ungodly: or, wicked</sup>
But his delight<S>2656</S> is in the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and in his law<S>8451</S> doth he meditate<S>1897</S> day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S>.
And he shall be like a tree<S>6086</S> planted<S>8362</S> by the rivers<S>6388</S> of water<S>4325</S>, that bringeth forth<S>5414</S> his fruit<S>6529</S> in his season<S>6256</S>; his leaf<S>5929</S> also shall not wither<S>5034</S>; and whatsoever he doeth<S>6213</S> shall prosper<S>6743</S>. <sup>wither: Heb. fade</sup>
The ungodly<S>7563</S> are not so: but are like the chaff<S>4671</S> which the wind<S>7307</S> driveth away<S>5086</S>.
Therefore the ungodly<S>7563</S> shall not stand<S>6965</S> in the judgment<S>4941</S>, nor sinners<S>2400</S> in the congregation<S>5712</S> of the righteous<S>6662</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> knoweth<S>3045</S> the way<S>1870</S> of the righteous<S>6662</S>: but the way<S>1870</S> of the ungodly<S>7563</S> shall perish<S>6</S>.

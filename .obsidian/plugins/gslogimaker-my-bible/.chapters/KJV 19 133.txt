A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S> of David<S>1732</S>. Behold, how good<S>2896</S> and how pleasant<S>5273</S> it is for brethren<S>251</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> together<S>3162</S> in unity<S>3162</S>! <sup>together: Heb. even together</sup>
It is like the precious<S>2896</S> ointment<S>8081</S> upon the head<S>7218</S>, that ran down<S>3381</S> upon the beard<S>2206</S>, even Aaron's<S>175</S> beard<S>2206</S>: that went down<S>3381</S> to the skirts<S>6310</S> of his garments<S>4060</S>;
As the dew<S>2919</S> of Hermon<S>2768</S>, and as the dew that descended<S>3381</S> upon the mountains<S>2042</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>: for there the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> the blessing<S>1293</S>, even life<S>2416</S> for evermore<S>5769</S>.

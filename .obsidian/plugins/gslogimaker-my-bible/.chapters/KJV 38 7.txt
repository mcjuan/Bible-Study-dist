And it came to pass in the fourth<S>702</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Darius<S>1867</S>, that the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto Zechariah<S>2148</S> in the fourth<S>702</S> day of the ninth<S>8671</S> month<S>2320</S>, even in Chisleu<S>3691</S>;
When they had sent<S>7971</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>410</S> Sherezer<S>8272</S> and Regemmelech<S>7278</S>, and their men<S>582</S>, to pray<S>2470</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, <sup>pray: Heb. intreat the face of</sup>
And to speak<S>559</S> unto the priests<S>3548</S> which were in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, and to the prophets<S>5030</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Should I weep<S>1058</S> in the fifth<S>2549</S> month<S>2320</S>, separating<S>5144</S> myself, as I have done<S>6213</S> these so many years<S>8141</S>?
Then came the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Speak<S>559</S> unto all the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, and to the priests<S>3548</S>, saying<S>559</S>, When ye fasted<S>6684</S> and mourned<S>5594</S> in the fifth<S>2549</S> and seventh<S>7637</S> month, even those seventy<S>7657</S> years<S>8141</S>, did ye at all<S>6684</S> fast<S>6684</S> unto me, even to me?
And when ye did eat<S>398</S>, and when ye did drink<S>8354</S>, did not ye eat<S>398</S> for yourselves, and drink<S>8354</S> for yourselves? <sup>did not ye: or, be not ye they that</sup>
Should ye not hear the words<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath cried<S>7121</S> by<S>3027</S> the former<S>7223</S> prophets<S>5030</S>, when Jerusalem<S>3389</S> was inhabited<S>3427</S> and in prosperity<S>7961</S>, and the cities<S>5892</S> thereof round about her<S>5439</S>, when men inhabited<S>3427</S> the south<S>5045</S> and the plain<S>8219</S>? <sup>Should: or, Are not these the words</sup> <sup>by: Heb. by the hand of</sup>
And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto Zechariah<S>2148</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Thus speaketh<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Execute<S>8199</S> true<S>571</S> judgment<S>4941</S>, and shew<S>6213</S> mercy<S>2617</S> and compassions<S>7356</S> every man<S>376</S> to his brother<S>251</S>: <sup>Execute: Heb. Judge judgment of truth</sup>
And oppress<S>6231</S> not the widow<S>490</S>, nor the fatherless<S>3490</S>, the stranger<S>1616</S>, nor the poor<S>6041</S>; and let none of you imagine<S>2803</S> evil<S>7451</S> against<S>376</S> his brother<S>251</S> in your heart<S>3824</S>.
But they refused<S>3985</S> to hearken<S>7181</S>, and pulled away<S>5414</S> <S>5637</S> the shoulder<S>3802</S>, and stopped<S>3513</S> their ears<S>241</S>, that they should not hear<S>8085</S>. <sup>pulled: Heb. they gave a backsliding shoulder</sup> <sup>stopped: Heb. made heavy</sup>
Yea, they made<S>7760</S> their hearts<S>3820</S> as an adamant stone<S>8068</S>, lest they should hear<S>8085</S> the law<S>8451</S>, and the words<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> in his spirit<S>7307</S> by<S>3027</S> the former<S>7223</S> prophets<S>5030</S>: therefore came a great<S>1419</S> wrath<S>7110</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>. <sup>by: Heb. by the hand of</sup>
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried<S>7121</S>, and they would not hear<S>8085</S>; so they cried<S>7121</S>, and I would not hear<S>8085</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>:
But I scattered them with a whirlwind<S>5590</S> among all the nations<S>1471</S> whom they knew<S>3045</S> not. Thus the land<S>776</S> was desolate<S>8074</S> after<S>310</S> them, that no man passed through<S>5674</S> nor returned<S>7725</S>: for they laid<S>7760</S> the pleasant<S>2532</S> land<S>776</S> desolate<S>8047</S>. <sup>pleasant: Heb. land of desire</sup>

And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> again<S>3254</S> did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, when Ehud<S>164</S> was dead<S>4191</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> sold<S>4376</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of Jabin<S>2985</S> king<S>4428</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, that reigned<S>4427</S> in Hazor<S>2674</S>; the captain<S>8269</S> of whose host<S>6635</S> was Sisera<S>5516</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> in Harosheth<S>2800</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: for he had nine<S>8672</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chariots<S>7393</S> of iron<S>1270</S>; and twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> he mightily<S>2394</S> oppressed<S>3905</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And Deborah<S>1683</S>, a prophetess<S>5031</S>, the wife<S>802</S> of Lapidoth<S>3941</S>, she judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> at that time<S>6256</S>.
And she dwelt<S>3427</S> under the palm tree<S>8560</S> of Deborah<S>1683</S> between Ramah<S>7414</S> and Bethel<S>1008</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>: and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came up<S>5927</S> to her for judgment<S>4941</S>.
And she sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> Barak<S>1301</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Abinoam<S>42</S> out of Kedeshnaphtali<S>6943</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Hath not the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> commanded<S>6680</S>, saying, Go<S>3212</S> and draw<S>4900</S> toward mount<S>2022</S> Tabor<S>8396</S>, and take<S>3947</S> with thee ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Naphtali<S>5321</S> and of the children<S>1121</S> of Zebulun<S>2074</S>?
And I will draw<S>4900</S> unto thee to the river<S>5158</S> Kishon<S>7028</S> Sisera<S>5516</S>, the captain<S>8269</S> of Jabin's<S>2985</S> army<S>6635</S>, with his chariots<S>7393</S> and his multitude<S>1995</S>; and I will deliver<S>5414</S> him into thine hand<S>3027</S>.
And Barak<S>1301</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, If thou wilt go<S>3212</S> with me, then I will go<S>1980</S>: but if thou wilt not go<S>3212</S> with me, then I will not go<S>3212</S>.
And she said<S>559</S>, I will surely<S>1980</S> go<S>3212</S> with thee: notwithstanding<S>657</S> the journey<S>1870</S> that thou takest<S>1980</S> shall not be for thine honour<S>8597</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> shall sell<S>4376</S> Sisera<S>5516</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of a woman<S>802</S>. And Deborah<S>1683</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> with Barak<S>1301</S> to Kedesh<S>6943</S>.
And Barak<S>1301</S> called<S>2199</S> Zebulun<S>2074</S> and Naphtali<S>5321</S> to Kedesh<S>6943</S>; and he went up<S>5927</S> with ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> at his feet<S>7272</S>: and Deborah<S>1683</S> went up<S>5927</S> with him.
Now Heber<S>2268</S> the Kenite<S>7017</S>, which was of the children<S>1121</S> of Hobab<S>2246</S> the father in law<S>2859</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>, had severed<S>6504</S> himself from the Kenites<S>7017</S>, and pitched<S>5186</S> his tent<S>168</S> unto the plain<S>436</S> of Zaanaim<S>6815</S>, which is by Kedesh<S>6943</S>.
And they shewed<S>5046</S> Sisera<S>5516</S> that Barak<S>1301</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Abinoam<S>42</S> was gone up<S>5927</S> to mount<S>2022</S> Tabor<S>8396</S>.
And Sisera<S>5516</S> gathered together<S>2199</S> all his chariots<S>7393</S>, even nine<S>8672</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chariots<S>7393</S> of iron<S>1270</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> that were with him, from Harosheth<S>2800</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S> unto the river<S>5158</S> of Kishon<S>7028</S>. <sup>together: Heb. by cry, or, proclamation</sup>
And Deborah<S>1683</S> said<S>559</S> unto Barak<S>1301</S>, Up<S>6965</S>; for this is the day<S>3117</S> in which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> Sisera<S>5516</S> into thine hand<S>3027</S>: is not the LORD<S>3068</S> gone out<S>3318</S> before<S>6440</S> thee? So Barak<S>1301</S> went down<S>3381</S> from mount<S>2022</S> Tabor<S>8396</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> after<S>310</S> him.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> discomfited<S>2000</S> Sisera<S>5516</S>, and all his chariots<S>7393</S>, and all his host<S>4264</S>, with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S> before<S>6440</S> Barak<S>1301</S>; so that Sisera<S>5516</S> lighted down<S>3381</S> off his chariot<S>4818</S>, and fled away<S>5127</S> on his feet<S>7272</S>.
But Barak<S>1301</S> pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> the chariots<S>7393</S>, and after the host<S>4264</S>, unto Harosheth<S>2800</S> of the Gentiles<S>1471</S>: and all the host<S>4264</S> of Sisera<S>5516</S> fell<S>5307</S> upon the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>; and there was not a man<S>259</S> left<S>7604</S>. <sup>a man: Heb. unto one</sup>
Howbeit Sisera<S>5516</S> fled away<S>5127</S> on his feet<S>7272</S> to the tent<S>168</S> of Jael<S>3278</S> the wife<S>802</S> of Heber<S>2268</S> the Kenite<S>7017</S>: for there was peace<S>7965</S> between Jabin<S>2985</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Hazor<S>2674</S> and the house<S>1004</S> of Heber<S>2268</S> the Kenite<S>7017</S>.
And Jael<S>3278</S> went out<S>3318</S> to meet<S>7125</S> Sisera<S>5516</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Turn in<S>5493</S>, my lord<S>113</S>, turn in<S>5493</S> to me; fear<S>3372</S> not. And when he had turned in<S>5493</S> unto her into the tent<S>168</S>, she covered<S>3680</S> him with a mantle<S>8063</S>. <sup>mantle: or, rug, or, blanket</sup>
And he said<S>559</S> unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little<S>4592</S> water<S>4325</S> to drink<S>8248</S>; for I am thirsty<S>6770</S>. And she opened<S>6605</S> a bottle<S>4997</S> of milk<S>2461</S>, and gave him drink<S>8248</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> him.
Again he said<S>559</S> unto her, Stand in<S>5975</S> the door<S>6607</S> of the tent<S>168</S>, and it shall be, when any man<S>376</S> doth come<S>935</S> and enquire<S>7592</S> of thee, and say<S>559</S>, Is there<S>3426</S> any man<S>376</S> here<S>3426</S>? that thou shalt say<S>559</S>, No.
Then Jael<S>3278</S> Heber's<S>2268</S> wife<S>802</S> took<S>3947</S> a nail<S>3489</S> of the tent<S>168</S>, and took<S>7760</S> an hammer<S>4718</S> in her hand<S>3027</S>, and went<S>935</S> softly<S>3814</S> unto him, and smote<S>8628</S> the nail<S>3489</S> into his temples<S>7541</S>, and fastened<S>6795</S> it into the ground<S>776</S>: for he was fast asleep<S>7290</S> and weary<S>5774</S>. So he died<S>4191</S>. <sup>and took: Heb. and put</sup>
And, behold, as Barak<S>1301</S> pursued<S>7291</S> Sisera<S>5516</S>, Jael<S>3278</S> came out<S>3318</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Come<S>3212</S>, and I will shew<S>7200</S> thee the man<S>376</S> whom thou seekest<S>1245</S>. And when he came<S>935</S> into her tent, behold, Sisera<S>5516</S> lay<S>5307</S> dead<S>4191</S>, and the nail<S>3489</S> was in his temples<S>7541</S>.
So God<S>430</S> subdued<S>3665</S> on that day<S>3117</S> Jabin<S>2985</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the hand<S>3027</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> prospered<S>3212</S> <S>1980</S>, and prevailed<S>7186</S> against Jabin<S>2985</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, until they had destroyed<S>3772</S> Jabin<S>2985</S> king<S>4428</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>. <sup>prospered: Heb. going went and was hard</sup>

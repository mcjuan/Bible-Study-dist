Also I in the first<S>259</S> year<S>8141</S> of Darius<S>1867</S> the Mede<S>4075</S>, even I, stood<S>5977</S> to confirm<S>2388</S> and to strengthen<S>4581</S> him.
And now will I shew<S>5046</S> thee the truth<S>571</S>. Behold, there shall stand up<S>5975</S> yet three<S>7969</S> kings<S>4428</S> in Persia<S>6539</S>; and the fourth<S>7243</S> shall be far<S>6239</S> richer<S>6238</S> than they all<S>1419</S>: and by his strength<S>2393</S> through his riches<S>6239</S> he shall stir up<S>5782</S> all against the realm<S>4438</S> of Grecia<S>3120</S>.
And a mighty<S>1368</S> king<S>4428</S> shall stand up<S>5975</S>, that shall rule<S>4910</S> with great<S>7227</S> dominion<S>4474</S>, and do<S>6213</S> according to his will<S>7522</S>.
And when he shall stand up<S>5975</S>, his kingdom<S>4438</S> shall be broken<S>7665</S>, and shall be divided<S>2673</S> toward the four<S>702</S> winds<S>7307</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>; and not to his posterity<S>319</S>, nor according to his dominion<S>4915</S> which he ruled<S>4910</S>: for his kingdom<S>4438</S> shall be plucked up<S>5428</S>, even for others<S>312</S> beside those.
And the king<S>4428</S> of the south<S>5045</S> shall be strong<S>2388</S>, and one of his princes<S>8269</S>; and he shall be strong<S>2388</S> above him, and have dominion<S>4910</S>; his dominion<S>4475</S> shall be a great<S>7227</S> dominion<S>4474</S>.
And in the end<S>7093</S> of years<S>8141</S> they shall join themselves together<S>2266</S>; for the king's<S>4428</S> daughter<S>1323</S> of the south<S>5045</S> shall come<S>935</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of the north<S>6828</S> to make<S>6213</S> an agreement<S>4339</S>: but she shall not retain<S>6113</S> the power<S>3581</S> of the arm<S>2220</S>; neither shall he stand<S>5975</S>, nor his arm<S>2220</S>: but she shall be given up<S>5414</S>, and they that brought<S>935</S> her, and he that begat<S>3205</S> her, and he that strengthened<S>2388</S> her in these times<S>6256</S>. <sup>join: Heb. associate themselves</sup> <sup>an: Heb. rights</sup> <sup>he that begat: or, whom she brought forth</sup>
But out of a branch<S>5342</S> of her roots<S>8328</S> shall one stand up<S>5975</S> in his estate<S>3653</S>, which shall come<S>935</S> with an army<S>2428</S>, and shall enter<S>935</S> into the fortress<S>4581</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of the north<S>6828</S>, and shall deal<S>6213</S> against them, and shall prevail<S>2388</S>: <sup>in: or, in his place, or, office</sup>
And shall also carry<S>935</S> captives<S>7628</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S> their gods<S>430</S>, with their princes<S>5257</S>, and with their precious<S>2532</S> vessels<S>3627</S> of silver<S>3701</S> and of gold<S>2091</S>; and he shall continue<S>5975</S> more years<S>8141</S> than the king<S>4428</S> of the north<S>6828</S>. <sup>their precious: Heb. vessels of their desire</sup>
So the king<S>4428</S> of the south<S>5045</S> shall come<S>935</S> into his kingdom<S>4438</S>, and shall return<S>7725</S> into his own land<S>127</S>.
But his sons<S>1121</S> shall be stirred up<S>1624</S>, and shall assemble<S>622</S> a multitude<S>1995</S> of great<S>7227</S> forces<S>2428</S>: and one shall certainly<S>935</S> come<S>935</S>, and overflow<S>7857</S>, and pass through<S>5674</S>: then shall he return<S>7725</S>, and be stirred up<S>1624</S>, even to his fortress<S>4581</S>. <sup>shall be: or, shall war</sup> <sup>return: or, be stirred up again</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> of the south<S>5045</S> shall be moved with choler<S>4843</S>, and shall come forth<S>3318</S> and fight<S>3898</S> with him, even with the king<S>4428</S> of the north<S>6828</S>: and he shall set forth<S>5975</S> a great<S>7227</S> multitude<S>1995</S>; but the multitude<S>1995</S> shall be given<S>5414</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>.
And when he hath taken away<S>5375</S> the multitude<S>1995</S>, his heart<S>3824</S> shall be lifted up<S>7311</S> <S>7311</S>; and he shall cast down<S>5307</S> many ten thousands<S>7239</S>: but he shall not be strengthened<S>5810</S> by it.
For the king<S>4428</S> of the north<S>6828</S> shall return<S>7725</S>, and shall set forth<S>5975</S> a multitude<S>1995</S> greater<S>7227</S> than the former<S>7223</S>, and shall certainly<S>935</S> come<S>935</S> after<S>7093</S> certain<S>6256</S> years<S>8141</S> with a great<S>1419</S> army<S>2428</S> and with much<S>7227</S> riches<S>7399</S>. <sup>after: Heb. at the end of times, even years</sup>

He shall also set<S>7760</S> his face<S>6440</S> to enter<S>935</S> with the strength<S>8633</S> of his whole kingdom<S>4438</S>, and upright ones<S>3477</S> with him; thus shall he do<S>6213</S>: and he shall give<S>5414</S> him the daughter<S>1323</S> of women<S>802</S>, corrupting<S>7843</S> her: but she shall not stand<S>5975</S> on his side, neither be for him. <sup>upright: or, much uprightness: or, equal conditions</sup> <sup>corrupting: Heb. to corrupt</sup>

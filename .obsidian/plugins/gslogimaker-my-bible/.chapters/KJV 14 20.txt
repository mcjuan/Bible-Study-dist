It came to pass after this<S>310</S> also, that the children<S>1121</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, and the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and with them other beside the Ammonites<S>5984</S>, came<S>935</S> against Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> to battle<S>4421</S>.
Then there came<S>935</S> some that told<S>5046</S> Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, saying<S>559</S>, There cometh<S>935</S> a great<S>7227</S> multitude<S>1995</S> against thee from beyond<S>5676</S> the sea<S>3220</S> on this side Syria<S>758</S>; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar<S>2688</S>, which is Engedi<S>5872</S>.
And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> feared<S>3372</S>, and set<S>5414</S> himself<S>6440</S> to seek<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and proclaimed<S>7121</S> a fast<S>6685</S> throughout<S>5921</S> all Judah<S>3063</S>. <sup>himself: Heb. his face</sup>
And Judah<S>3063</S> gathered themselves together<S>6908</S>, to ask<S>1245</S> help of the LORD<S>3068</S>: even out of all the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> they came<S>935</S> to seek<S>1245</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> stood<S>5975</S> in the congregation<S>6951</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, before<S>6440</S> the new<S>2319</S> court<S>2691</S>,
And said<S>559</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of our fathers<S>1</S>, art not thou God<S>430</S> in heaven<S>8064</S>? and rulest<S>4910</S> not thou over all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>? and in thine hand<S>3027</S> is there not power<S>3581</S> and might<S>1369</S>, so that none is able to withstand<S>3320</S> thee?
Art not thou our God<S>430</S>, who didst drive out<S>3423</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of this land<S>776</S> before<S>6440</S> thy people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and gavest<S>5414</S> it to the seed<S>2233</S> of Abraham<S>85</S> thy friend<S>157</S> for ever<S>5769</S>? <sup>who: Heb. thou</sup>
And they dwelt<S>3427</S> therein, and have built<S>1129</S> thee a sanctuary<S>4720</S> therein for thy name<S>8034</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
If, when evil<S>7451</S> cometh<S>935</S> upon us, as the sword<S>2719</S>, judgment<S>8196</S>, or pestilence<S>1698</S>, or famine<S>7458</S>, we stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> this house<S>1004</S>, and in thy presence<S>6440</S>, (for thy name<S>8034</S> is in this house<S>1004</S>,) and cry<S>2199</S> unto thee in our affliction<S>6869</S>, then thou wilt hear<S>8085</S> and help<S>3467</S>.
And now, behold, the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> and Moab<S>4124</S> and mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S>, whom thou wouldest not let<S>5414</S> Israel<S>3478</S> invade<S>935</S>, when they came out<S>935</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, but they turned<S>5493</S> from them, and destroyed<S>8045</S> them not;
Behold, I say, how they reward<S>1580</S> us, to come<S>935</S> to cast us out<S>1644</S> of thy possession<S>3425</S>, which thou hast given us to inherit<S>3423</S>.
O our God<S>430</S>, wilt thou not judge<S>8199</S> them? for we have no might<S>3581</S> against<S>6440</S> this great<S>7227</S> company<S>1995</S> that cometh<S>935</S> against us; neither know<S>3045</S> we<S>587</S> what to do<S>6213</S>: but our eyes<S>5869</S> are upon thee.
And all Judah<S>3063</S> stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, with<S>1571</S> their little ones<S>2945</S>, their wives<S>802</S>, and their children<S>1121</S>.
Then upon Jahaziel<S>3166</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zechariah<S>2148</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Benaiah<S>1141</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jeiel<S>3273</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Mattaniah<S>4983</S>, a Levite<S>3881</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Asaph<S>623</S>, came the Spirit<S>7307</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of the congregation<S>6951</S>;
And he said<S>559</S>, Hearken<S>7181</S> ye, all Judah<S>3063</S>, and ye inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and thou king<S>4428</S> Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> unto you, Be not afraid<S>3372</S> nor dismayed<S>2865</S> by reason<S>6440</S> of this great<S>7227</S> multitude<S>1995</S>; for the battle<S>4421</S> is not yours, but God's<S>430</S>.
To morrow<S>4279</S> go ye down<S>3381</S> against them: behold, they come up<S>5927</S> by the cliff<S>4608</S> of Ziz<S>6732</S>; and ye shall find<S>4672</S> them at the end<S>5490</S> of the brook<S>5158</S>, before<S>6440</S> the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Jeruel<S>3385</S>. <sup>cliff: Heb. ascent</sup> <sup>brook: or, valley</sup>
Ye shall not need to fight<S>3898</S> in this<S>2063</S> battle: set<S>3320</S> yourselves, stand<S>5975</S> ye still, and see<S>7200</S> the salvation<S>3444</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> with you, O Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: fear<S>3372</S> not, nor be dismayed<S>2865</S>; to morrow<S>4279</S> go out<S>3318</S> against<S>6440</S> them: for the LORD<S>3068</S> will be with you.
And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> bowed<S>6915</S> his head with his face<S>639</S> to the ground<S>776</S>: and all Judah<S>3063</S> and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> fell<S>5307</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, worshipping<S>7812</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the Levites<S>3881</S>, of the children<S>1121</S> of the Kohathites<S>6956</S>, and of the children<S>1121</S> of the Korhites<S>7145</S>, stood up<S>6965</S> to praise<S>1984</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S> on high<S>4605</S>.
And they rose early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and went forth<S>3318</S> into the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Tekoa<S>8620</S>: and as they went forth<S>3318</S>, Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> stood<S>5975</S> and said<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> me, O Judah<S>3063</S>, and ye inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; Believe<S>539</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, so shall ye be established<S>539</S>; believe<S>539</S> his prophets<S>5030</S>, so shall ye prosper<S>6743</S>.
And when he had consulted<S>3289</S> with the people<S>5971</S>, he appointed<S>5975</S> singers<S>7891</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and that should praise<S>1984</S> the beauty<S>1927</S> of holiness<S>6944</S>, as they went out<S>3318</S> before<S>6440</S> the army<S>2502</S>, and to say<S>559</S>, Praise<S>3034</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; for his mercy<S>2617</S> endureth for ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>that: Heb. praisers</sup>
And when<S>6256</S> they began<S>2490</S> to sing<S>7440</S> and to praise<S>8416</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> set<S>5414</S> ambushments<S>693</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, Moab<S>4124</S>, and mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S>, which were come<S>935</S> against Judah<S>3063</S>; and they were smitten<S>5062</S>. <sup>And when: Heb.

For the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> and Moab<S>4124</S> stood up<S>5975</S> against the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S>, utterly to slay<S>2763</S> and destroy<S>8045</S> them: and when they had made an end<S>3615</S> of the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Seir<S>8165</S>, every one<S>376</S> helped<S>5826</S> to destroy<S>4889</S> another<S>7453</S>. <sup>to destroy: Heb. for the destruction</sup>
And when Judah<S>3063</S> came<S>935</S> toward the watch tower<S>4707</S> <S>4708</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, they looked<S>6437</S> unto the multitude<S>1995</S>, and, behold, they were dead bodies<S>6297</S> fallen<S>5307</S> to the earth<S>776</S>, and none escaped<S>6413</S>. <sup>none: Heb. there was not an escaping</sup>
And when Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> and his people<S>5971</S> came<S>935</S> to take away<S>962</S> the spoil<S>7998</S> of them, they found<S>4672</S> among them in abundance<S>7230</S> both riches<S>7399</S> with the dead bodies<S>6297</S>, and precious<S>2532</S> jewels<S>3627</S>, which they stripped off<S>5337</S> for themselves, more than<S>369</S> they could carry away<S>4853</S>: and they were three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S> in gathering<S>962</S> of the spoil<S>7998</S>, it was so much<S>7227</S>.
And on the fourth<S>7243</S> day<S>3117</S> they assembled<S>6950</S> themselves in the valley<S>6010</S> of Berachah<S>1294</S>; for there they blessed<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: therefore the name<S>8034</S> of the same place<S>4725</S> was called<S>7121</S>, The valley<S>6010</S> of Berachah<S>1294</S>, unto this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>Berachah: that is, blessing</sup>
Then they returned<S>7725</S>, every man<S>376</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> in the forefront<S>7218</S> of them, to go again<S>7725</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with joy<S>8057</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> had made them to rejoice<S>8055</S> over their enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>forefront: Heb. head</sup>
And they came<S>935</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S> with psalteries<S>5035</S> and harps<S>3658</S> and trumpets<S>2689</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the fear<S>6343</S> of God<S>430</S> was on all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of those countries<S>776</S>, when they had heard<S>8085</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> fought<S>3898</S> against the enemies<S>341</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
So the realm<S>4438</S> of Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> was quiet<S>8252</S>: for his God<S>430</S> gave him rest<S>5117</S> round about<S>5439</S>.
And Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> reigned<S>4427</S> over Judah<S>3063</S>: he was thirty<S>7970</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Azubah<S>5806</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Shilhi<S>7977</S>.
And he walked<S>3212</S> in the way<S>1870</S> of Asa<S>609</S> his father<S>1</S>, and departed<S>5493</S> not from it, doing<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Howbeit the high places<S>1116</S> were not taken away<S>5493</S>: for as yet the people<S>5971</S> had not prepared<S>3559</S> their hearts<S>3824</S> unto the God<S>430</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, first<S>7223</S> and last<S>314</S>, behold, they are written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>1697</S> of Jehu<S>3058</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hanani<S>2607</S>, who is mentioned<S>5927</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>book of Jehu: Heb. words, etc</sup> <sup>is mentioned: Heb. was made to ascend</sup>

And he joined<S>2266</S> himself with him to make<S>6213</S> ships<S>591</S> to go<S>3212</S> to Tarshish<S>8659</S>: and they made<S>6213</S> the ships<S>591</S> in Eziongeber<S>6100</S>.
Then Eliezer<S>461</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Dodavah<S>1735</S> of Mareshah<S>4762</S> prophesied<S>5012</S> against Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Because thou hast joined<S>2266</S> thyself with Ahaziah<S>274</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> hath broken<S>6555</S> thy works<S>4639</S>.

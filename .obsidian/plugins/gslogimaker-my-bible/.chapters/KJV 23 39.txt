At that time<S>6256</S> Merodachbaladan<S>4757</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Baladan<S>1081</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, sent<S>7971</S> letters<S>5612</S> and a present<S>4503</S> to Hezekiah<S>2396</S>: for he had heard<S>8085</S> that he had been sick<S>2470</S>, and was recovered<S>2388</S>.
And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> was glad<S>8055</S> of them, and shewed<S>7200</S> them the house<S>1004</S> of his precious things<S>5238</S>, the silver<S>3701</S>, and the gold<S>2091</S>, and the spices<S>1314</S>, and the precious<S>2896</S> ointment<S>8081</S>, and all the house<S>1004</S> of his armour<S>3627</S>, and all that was found<S>4672</S> in his treasures<S>214</S>: there was nothing<S>1697</S> in his house<S>1004</S>, nor in all his dominion<S>4475</S>, that Hezekiah<S>2396</S> shewed<S>7200</S> them not. <sup>precious things: or, spicery</sup> <sup>armour: or, jewels: Heb. vessels, or, instruments</sup>
Then came<S>935</S> Isaiah<S>3470</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> unto king<S>4428</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, What said<S>559</S> these men<S>582</S>? and from whence<S>370</S> came<S>935</S> they unto thee? And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> said<S>559</S>, They are come<S>935</S> from a far<S>7350</S> country<S>776</S> unto me, even from Babylon<S>894</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> he, What have they seen<S>7200</S> in thine house<S>1004</S>? And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> answered<S>559</S>, All that is in mine house<S>1004</S> have they seen<S>7200</S>: there is nothing<S>1697</S> among my treasures<S>214</S> that I have not shewed<S>7200</S> them.
Then said<S>559</S> Isaiah<S>3470</S> to Hezekiah<S>2396</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>:
Behold, the days<S>3117</S> come<S>935</S>, that all that is in thine house<S>1004</S>, and that which thy fathers<S>1</S> have laid up in store<S>686</S> until this day<S>3117</S>, shall be carried<S>5375</S> to Babylon<S>894</S>: nothing<S>1697</S> shall be left<S>3498</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And of thy sons<S>1121</S> that shall issue<S>3318</S> from thee, which thou shalt beget<S>3205</S>, shall they take away<S>3947</S>; and they shall be eunuchs<S>5631</S> in the palace<S>1964</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S> to Isaiah<S>3470</S>, Good<S>2896</S> is the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> which thou hast spoken<S>1696</S>. He said<S>559</S> moreover, For there shall be peace<S>7965</S> and truth<S>571</S> in my days<S>3117</S>.

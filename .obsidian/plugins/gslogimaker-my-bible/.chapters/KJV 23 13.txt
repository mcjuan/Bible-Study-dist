The burden<S>4853</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, which Isaiah<S>3470</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Amoz<S>531</S> did see<S>2372</S>.
Lift ye up<S>5375</S> a banner<S>5251</S> upon the high<S>8192</S> mountain<S>2022</S>, exalt<S>7311</S> the voice<S>6963</S> unto them, shake<S>5130</S> the hand<S>3027</S>, that they may go<S>935</S> into the gates<S>6607</S> of the nobles<S>5081</S>.
I have commanded<S>6680</S> my sanctified ones<S>6942</S>, I have also called<S>7121</S> my mighty ones<S>1368</S> for mine anger<S>639</S>, even them that rejoice<S>5947</S> in my highness<S>1346</S>.
The noise<S>6963</S> of a multitude<S>1995</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S>, like as<S>1823</S> of a great<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>; a tumultuous<S>7588</S> noise<S>6963</S> of the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of nations<S>1471</S> gathered together<S>622</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> mustereth<S>6485</S> the host<S>6635</S> of the battle<S>4421</S>. <sup>like: Heb. the likeness of</sup>
They come<S>935</S> from a far<S>4801</S> country<S>776</S>, from the end<S>7097</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, even the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the weapons<S>3627</S> of his indignation<S>2195</S>, to destroy<S>2254</S> the whole land<S>776</S>.
Howl<S>3213</S> ye; for the day<S>3117</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is at hand<S>7138</S>; it shall come<S>935</S> as a destruction<S>7701</S> from the Almighty<S>7706</S>.
Therefore shall all hands<S>3027</S> be faint<S>7503</S>, and every man's<S>582</S> heart<S>3824</S> shall melt<S>4549</S>: <sup>be faint: or, fall down</sup>
And they shall be afraid<S>926</S>: pangs<S>6735</S> and sorrows<S>2256</S> shall take hold<S>270</S> of them; they shall be in pain<S>2342</S> as a woman that travaileth<S>3205</S>: they shall be amazed<S>8539</S> one<S>376</S> at another<S>7453</S>; their faces<S>6440</S> shall be as flames<S>3851</S>. <sup>be amazed: Heb. wonder</sup> <sup>one: Heb. every man at his neighbour</sup> <sup>flames: Heb. faces of the flames</sup>
Behold, the day<S>3117</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> cometh<S>935</S>, cruel<S>394</S> both with wrath<S>5678</S> and fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S>, to lay<S>7760</S> the land<S>776</S> desolate<S>8047</S>: and he shall destroy<S>8045</S> the sinners<S>2400</S> thereof out of it.
For the stars<S>3556</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> and the constellations<S>3685</S> thereof shall not give<S>1984</S> their light<S>216</S>: the sun<S>8121</S> shall be darkened<S>2821</S> in his going forth<S>3318</S>, and the moon<S>3394</S> shall not cause her light<S>216</S> to shine<S>5050</S>.
And I will punish<S>6485</S> the world<S>8398</S> for their evil<S>7451</S>, and the wicked<S>7563</S> for their iniquity<S>5771</S>; and I will cause the arrogancy<S>1347</S> of the proud<S>2086</S> to cease<S>7673</S>, and will lay low<S>8213</S> the haughtiness<S>1346</S> of the terrible<S>6184</S>.
I will make a man<S>582</S> more precious<S>3365</S> than fine gold<S>6337</S>; even a man<S>120</S> than the golden wedge<S>3800</S> of Ophir<S>211</S>.
Therefore I will shake<S>7264</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>, and the earth<S>776</S> shall remove<S>7493</S> out of her place<S>4725</S>, in the wrath<S>5678</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, and in the day<S>3117</S> of his fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S>.
And it shall be as the chased<S>5080</S> roe<S>6643</S>, and as a sheep<S>6629</S> that no man taketh up<S>6908</S>: they shall every man<S>376</S> turn<S>6437</S> to his own people<S>5971</S>, and flee<S>5127</S> every one<S>376</S> into his own land<S>776</S>.
Every one that is found<S>4672</S> shall be thrust through<S>1856</S>; and every one that is joined<S>5595</S> unto them shall fall<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>.
Their children<S>5768</S> also shall be dashed to pieces<S>7376</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>; their houses<S>1004</S> shall be spoiled<S>8155</S>, and their wives<S>802</S> ravished<S>7901</S> <S>7693</S>.
Behold, I will stir up<S>5782</S> the Medes<S>4074</S> against them, which shall not regard<S>2803</S> silver<S>3701</S>; and as for gold<S>2091</S>, they shall not delight<S>2654</S> in it.
Their bows<S>7198</S> also shall dash<S>7376</S> the young men<S>5288</S> to pieces<S>7376</S>; and they shall have no pity<S>7355</S> on the fruit<S>6529</S> of the womb<S>990</S>; their eye<S>5869</S> shall not spare<S>2347</S> children<S>1121</S>.
And Babylon<S>894</S>, the glory<S>6643</S> of kingdoms<S>4467</S>, the beauty<S>8597</S> of the Chaldees'<S>3778</S> excellency<S>1347</S>, shall be as when God<S>430</S> overthrew<S>4114</S> Sodom<S>5467</S> and Gomorrah<S>6017</S>. <sup>as: Heb. as the overthrowing</sup>

But wild beasts of the desert<S>6728</S> shall lie<S>7257</S> there; and their houses<S>1004</S> shall be full<S>4390</S> of doleful creatures<S>255</S>; and owls<S>1323</S> <S>3284</S> shall dwell<S>7931</S> there, and satyrs<S>8163</S> shall dance<S>7540</S> there. <sup>wild: Heb.

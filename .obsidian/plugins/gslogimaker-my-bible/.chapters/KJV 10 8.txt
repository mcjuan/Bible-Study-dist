And after<S>310</S> this it came to pass, that David<S>1732</S> smote<S>5221</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and subdued<S>3665</S> them: and David<S>1732</S> took<S>3947</S> Methegammah<S>4965</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>. <sup>Methegammah: or, the bridle of Ammah</sup>
And he smote<S>5221</S> Moab<S>4124</S>, and measured<S>4058</S> them with a line<S>2256</S>, casting them down<S>7901</S> to the ground<S>776</S>; even with two<S>8147</S> lines<S>2256</S> measured<S>4058</S> he to put to death<S>4191</S>, and with one full<S>4393</S> line<S>2256</S> to keep alive<S>2421</S>. And so the Moabites<S>4124</S> became David's<S>1732</S> servants<S>5650</S>, and brought<S>5375</S> gifts<S>4503</S>.
David<S>1732</S> smote<S>5221</S> also Hadadezer<S>1909</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Rehob<S>7340</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Zobah<S>6678</S>, as he went<S>3212</S> to recover<S>7725</S> his border<S>3027</S> at the river<S>5104</S> Euphrates<S>6578</S>. <sup>Hadadezer: or, Hadarezer</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> took<S>3920</S> from him a thousand<S>505</S> chariots, and seven<S>7651</S> hundred<S>3967</S> horsemen<S>6571</S>, and twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> footmen<S>376</S> <S>7273</S>: and David<S>1732</S> houghed<S>6131</S> all the chariot<S>7393</S> horses, but reserved<S>3498</S> of them for an hundred<S>3967</S> chariots<S>7393</S>. <sup>from: or, of his. chariots: as 1.Chr.18.4</sup>
And when the Syrians<S>758</S> of Damascus<S>1834</S> came<S>935</S> to succour<S>5826</S> Hadadezer<S>1909</S> king<S>4428</S> of Zobah<S>6678</S>, David<S>1732</S> slew<S>5221</S> of the Syrians<S>758</S> two<S>8147</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>.
Then David<S>1732</S> put<S>7760</S> garrisons<S>5333</S> in Syria<S>758</S> of Damascus<S>1834</S>: and the Syrians<S>758</S> became servants<S>5650</S> to David<S>1732</S>, and brought<S>5375</S> gifts<S>4503</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> preserved<S>3467</S> David<S>1732</S> whithersoever he went<S>1980</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> took<S>3947</S> the shields<S>7982</S> of gold<S>2091</S> that were on the servants<S>5650</S> of Hadadezer<S>1909</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And from Betah<S>984</S>, and from Berothai<S>1268</S>, cities<S>5892</S> of Hadadezer<S>1909</S>, king<S>4428</S> David<S>1732</S> took<S>3947</S> exceeding<S>3966</S> much<S>7235</S> brass<S>5178</S>.
When Toi<S>8583</S> king<S>4428</S> of Hamath<S>2574</S> heard<S>8085</S> that David<S>1732</S> had smitten<S>5221</S> all the host<S>2428</S> of Hadadezer<S>1909</S>,
Then Toi<S>8583</S> sent<S>7971</S> Joram<S>3141</S> his son<S>1121</S> unto king<S>4428</S> David<S>1732</S>, to salute<S>7592</S> <S>7965</S> him, and to bless<S>1288</S> him, because he had fought<S>3898</S> against Hadadezer<S>1909</S>, and smitten<S>5221</S> him: for Hadadezer<S>1909</S> had wars<S>376</S> <S>4421</S> with Toi<S>8583</S>.

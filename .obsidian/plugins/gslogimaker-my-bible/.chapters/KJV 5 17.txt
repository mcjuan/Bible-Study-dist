Thou shalt not sacrifice<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> any bullock<S>7794</S>, or sheep<S>7716</S>, wherein is blemish<S>3971</S>, or any evilfavouredness<S>7451</S> <S>1697</S>: for that is an abomination<S>8441</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>. <sup>sheep: or, goat</sup>
If there be found<S>4672</S> among<S>7130</S> you, within any<S>259</S> of thy gates<S>8179</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee, man<S>376</S> or woman<S>802</S>, that hath wrought<S>6213</S> wickedness<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, in transgressing<S>5674</S> his covenant<S>1285</S>,
And hath gone<S>3212</S> and served<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, and worshipped<S>7812</S> them, either the sun<S>8121</S>, or moon<S>3394</S>, or any of the host<S>6635</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, which I have not commanded<S>6680</S>;
And it be told<S>5046</S> thee, and thou hast heard<S>8085</S> of it, and enquired<S>1875</S> diligently<S>3190</S>, and, behold, it be true<S>571</S>, and the thing<S>1697</S> certain<S>3559</S>, that such abomination<S>8441</S> is wrought<S>6213</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>:
Then shalt thou bring forth<S>3318</S> that man<S>376</S> or that woman<S>802</S>, which have committed<S>6213</S> that wicked<S>7451</S> thing<S>1697</S>, unto thy gates<S>8179</S>, even that man<S>376</S> or that woman<S>802</S>, and shalt stone<S>5619</S> them with stones<S>68</S>, till they die<S>4191</S>.
At the mouth<S>6310</S> of two<S>8147</S> witnesses<S>5707</S>, or three<S>7969</S> witnesses<S>5707</S>, shall he that is worthy of death<S>4191</S> be put to death<S>4191</S>; but at the mouth<S>6310</S> of one<S>259</S> witness<S>5707</S> he shall not be put to death<S>4191</S>.
The hands<S>3027</S> of the witnesses<S>5707</S> shall be first<S>7223</S> upon him to put him to death<S>4191</S>, and afterward<S>314</S> the hands<S>3027</S> of all the people<S>5971</S>. So thou shalt put<S>1197</S> the evil<S>7451</S> away<S>1197</S> from among<S>7130</S> you.
If there arise a matter<S>1697</S> too hard<S>6381</S> for thee in judgment<S>4941</S>, between blood<S>1818</S> and blood<S>1818</S>, between plea<S>1779</S> and plea<S>1779</S>, and between stroke<S>5061</S> and stroke<S>5061</S>, being matters<S>1697</S> of controversy<S>7379</S> within thy gates<S>8179</S>: then shalt thou arise<S>6965</S>, and get thee up<S>5927</S> into the place<S>4725</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> shall choose<S>977</S>;
And thou shalt come<S>935</S> unto the priests<S>3548</S> the Levites<S>3881</S>, and unto the judge<S>8199</S> that shall be in those days<S>3117</S>, and enquire<S>1875</S>; and they shall shew<S>5046</S> thee the sentence<S>1697</S> of judgment<S>4941</S>:
And thou shalt do<S>6213</S> according to the sentence<S>6310</S> <S>1697</S>, which they of that place<S>4725</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> shall choose<S>977</S> shall shew<S>5046</S> thee; and thou shalt observe<S>8104</S> to do<S>6213</S> according to all that they inform<S>3384</S> thee:
According to the sentence<S>6310</S> of the law<S>8451</S> which they shall teach<S>3384</S> thee, and according to the judgment<S>4941</S> which they shall tell<S>559</S> thee, thou shalt do<S>6213</S>: thou shalt not decline<S>5493</S> from the sentence<S>1697</S> which they shall shew<S>5046</S> thee, to the right hand<S>3225</S>, nor to the left<S>8040</S>.
And the man<S>376</S> that will do<S>6213</S> presumptuously<S>2087</S>, and will not hearken<S>8085</S> unto the priest<S>3548</S> that standeth<S>5975</S> to minister<S>8334</S> there before the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, or unto the judge<S>8199</S>, even that man<S>376</S> shall die<S>4191</S>: and thou shalt put away<S>1197</S> the evil<S>7451</S> from Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>and will: Heb. not to hearken</sup>
And all the people<S>5971</S> shall hear<S>8085</S>, and fear<S>3372</S>, and do no more presumptuously<S>2102</S>.
When thou art come<S>935</S> unto the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee, and shalt possess<S>3423</S> it, and shalt dwell<S>3427</S> therein, and shalt say<S>559</S>, I will set<S>7760</S> a king<S>4428</S> over me, like as all the nations<S>1471</S> that are about<S>5439</S> me;
Thou shalt in any wise<S>7760</S> set<S>7760</S> him king<S>4428</S> over thee, whom the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> shall choose<S>977</S>: one from among<S>7130</S> thy brethren<S>251</S> shalt thou set<S>7760</S> king<S>4428</S> over thee: thou mayest<S>3201</S> not set<S>5414</S> a stranger<S>5237</S> <S>376</S> over thee, which is not thy brother<S>251</S>.
But he shall not multiply<S>7235</S> horses<S>5483</S> to himself, nor cause the people<S>5971</S> to return<S>7725</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S>, to the end that he should multiply<S>7235</S> horses<S>5483</S>: forasmuch as the LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>559</S> unto you, Ye shall henceforth<S>3254</S> return<S>7725</S> no more that way<S>1870</S>.
Neither shall he multiply<S>7235</S> wives<S>802</S> to himself, that his heart<S>3824</S> turn<S>5493</S> not away: neither shall he greatly<S>3966</S> multiply<S>7235</S> to himself silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>.
And it shall be, when he sitteth<S>3427</S> upon the throne<S>3678</S> of his kingdom<S>4467</S>, that he shall write<S>3789</S> him a copy<S>4932</S> of this law<S>8451</S> in a book<S>5612</S> out of that which is before<S>6440</S> the priests<S>3548</S> the Levites<S>3881</S>:
And it shall be with him, and he shall read<S>7121</S> therein all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>: that he may learn<S>3925</S> to fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, to keep<S>8104</S> all the words<S>1697</S> of this law<S>8451</S> and these statutes<S>2706</S>, to do<S>6213</S> them:
That his heart<S>3824</S> be not lifted up<S>7311</S> above his brethren<S>251</S>, and that he turn not aside<S>5493</S> from the commandment<S>4687</S>, to the right hand<S>3225</S>, or to the left<S>8040</S>: to the end that he may prolong<S>748</S> his days<S>3117</S> in his kingdom<S>4467</S>, he, and his children<S>1121</S>, in the midst<S>7130</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.

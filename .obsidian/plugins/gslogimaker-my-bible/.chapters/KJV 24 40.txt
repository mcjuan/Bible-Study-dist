The word<S>1697</S> that came to Jeremiah<S>3414</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, after<S>310</S> that Nebuzaradan<S>5018</S> the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> had let him go<S>7971</S> from Ramah<S>7414</S>, when he had taken<S>3947</S> him being bound<S>631</S> in chains<S>246</S> among<S>8432</S> all that were carried away captive<S>1546</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> and Judah<S>3063</S>, which were carried away captive<S>1540</S> unto Babylon<S>894</S>. <sup>chains: or, manicles</sup>
And the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> took<S>3947</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, The LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath pronounced<S>1696</S> this evil<S>7451</S> upon this place<S>4725</S>.
Now the LORD<S>3068</S> hath brought<S>935</S> it, and done<S>6213</S> according as he hath said<S>1696</S>: because ye have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>, and have not obeyed<S>8085</S> his voice<S>6963</S>, therefore this thing<S>1697</S> is come upon you.
And now, behold, I loose<S>6605</S> thee this day<S>3117</S> from the chains<S>246</S> which were upon thine hand<S>3027</S>. If it seem good<S>2896</S> <S>5869</S> unto thee to come<S>935</S> with me into Babylon<S>894</S>, come<S>935</S>; and I will look well<S>7760</S> <S>5869</S> unto thee: but if it seem ill<S>7489</S> <S>5869</S> unto thee to come<S>935</S> with me into Babylon<S>894</S>, forbear<S>2308</S>: behold<S>7200</S>, all the land<S>776</S> is before<S>6440</S> thee: whither it seemeth<S>413</S> good<S>2896</S> and convenient<S>3477</S> <S>5869</S> for thee to go<S>3212</S>, thither go<S>3212</S>. <sup>were: or, are upon thine hand</sup> <sup>I will: Heb. I will set mine eye upon thee</sup>
Now while he was not yet gone back<S>7725</S>, he said, Go back<S>7725</S> also to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S>, whom the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> hath made governor<S>6485</S> over the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and dwell<S>3427</S> with him among<S>8432</S> the people<S>5971</S>: or go<S>3212</S> wheresoever it seemeth convenient<S>3477</S> <S>5869</S> unto thee to go<S>3212</S>. So the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> gave<S>5414</S> him victuals<S>737</S> and a reward<S>4864</S>, and let him go<S>7971</S>.
Then went<S>935</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S> unto Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> to Mizpah<S>4708</S>; and dwelt<S>3427</S> with him among<S>8432</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were left<S>7604</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
Now when all the captains<S>8269</S> of the forces<S>2428</S> which were in the fields<S>7704</S>, even they and their men<S>582</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had made Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> governor<S>6485</S> in the land<S>776</S>, and had committed<S>6485</S> unto him men<S>582</S>, and women<S>802</S>, and children<S>2945</S>, and of the poor<S>1803</S> of the land<S>776</S>, of them that were not carried away captive<S>1540</S> to Babylon<S>894</S>;
Then they came<S>935</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> to Mizpah<S>4708</S>, even Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and Johanan<S>3110</S> and Jonathan<S>3129</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, and Seraiah<S>8304</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Tanhumeth<S>8576</S>, and the sons<S>1121</S> of Ephai<S>5778</S> the Netophathite<S>5200</S>, and Jezaniah<S>3153</S> the son<S>1121</S> of a Maachathite<S>4602</S>, they and their men<S>582</S>.
And Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto them and to their men<S>582</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Fear<S>3372</S> not to serve<S>5647</S> the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>: dwell in<S>3427</S> the land<S>776</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, and it shall be well<S>3190</S> with you.
As for me, behold, I will dwell<S>3427</S> at Mizpah<S>4709</S> to serve<S>5975</S> <S>6440</S> the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>, which will come<S>935</S> unto us: but ye, gather<S>622</S> ye wine<S>3196</S>, and summer fruits<S>7019</S>, and oil<S>8081</S>, and put<S>7760</S> them in your vessels<S>3627</S>, and dwell<S>3427</S> in your cities<S>5892</S> that ye have taken<S>8610</S>. <sup>to serve: Heb. to stand before</sup>
Likewise when all the Jews<S>3064</S> that were in Moab<S>4124</S>, and among the Ammonites<S>5983</S>, and in Edom<S>123</S>, and that were in all the countries<S>776</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had left<S>5414</S> a remnant<S>7611</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and that he had set<S>6485</S> over them Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S>;
Even all the Jews<S>3064</S> returned out<S>7725</S> of all places<S>4725</S> whither they were driven<S>5080</S>, and came<S>935</S> to the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, to Gedaliah<S>1436</S>, unto Mizpah<S>4708</S>, and gathered<S>622</S> wine<S>3196</S> and summer fruits<S>7019</S> very<S>3966</S> much<S>7235</S>.
Moreover Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, and all the captains<S>8269</S> of the forces<S>2428</S> that were in the fields<S>7704</S>, came<S>935</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> to Mizpah<S>4708</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto him, Dost thou certainly<S>3045</S> know<S>3045</S> that Baalis<S>1185</S> the king<S>4428</S> of the Ammonites<S>1121</S> <S>5983</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S> to slay<S>5221</S> <S>5315</S> thee? But Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> believed<S>539</S> them not. <sup>to slay: Heb. to strike thee in soul?</sup>
Then Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S> spake<S>559</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> in Mizpah<S>4709</S> secretly<S>5643</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Let me go<S>3212</S>, I pray thee, and I will slay<S>5221</S> Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and no man<S>376</S> shall know<S>3045</S> it: wherefore should he slay<S>5221</S> <S>5315</S> thee, that all the Jews<S>3064</S> which are gathered<S>6908</S> unto thee should be scattered<S>6327</S>, and the remnant<S>7611</S> in Judah<S>3063</S> perish<S>6</S>?
But Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S> said<S>559</S> unto Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kareah<S>7143</S>, Thou shalt not do<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S>: for thou speakest<S>1696</S> falsely<S>8267</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>.

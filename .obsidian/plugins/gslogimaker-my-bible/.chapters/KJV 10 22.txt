And David<S>1732</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> the words<S>1697</S> of this song<S>7892</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> had delivered<S>5337</S> him out of the hand<S>3709</S> of all his enemies<S>341</S>, and out of the hand<S>3709</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>:
And he said<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> is my rock<S>5553</S>, and my fortress<S>4686</S>, and my deliverer<S>6403</S>;
The God<S>430</S> of my rock<S>6697</S>; in him will I trust<S>2620</S>: he is my shield<S>4043</S>, and the horn<S>7161</S> of my salvation<S>3468</S>, my high tower<S>4869</S>, and my refuge<S>4498</S>, my saviour<S>3467</S>; thou savest<S>3467</S> me from violence<S>2555</S>.
I will call<S>7121</S> on the LORD<S>3068</S>, who is worthy to be praised<S>1984</S>: so shall I be saved<S>3467</S> from mine enemies<S>341</S>.
When the waves<S>4867</S> of death<S>4194</S> compassed<S>661</S> me, the floods<S>5158</S> of ungodly men<S>1100</S> made me afraid<S>1204</S>; <sup>waves: or, pangs</sup> <sup>ungodly: Heb. Belial</sup>
The sorrows<S>2256</S> of hell<S>7585</S> compassed me about<S>5437</S>; the snares<S>4170</S> of death<S>4194</S> prevented<S>6923</S> me; <sup>sorrows: or, cords</sup>
In my distress<S>6862</S> I called<S>7121</S> upon the LORD<S>3068</S>, and cried<S>7121</S> to my God<S>430</S>: and he did hear<S>8085</S> my voice<S>6963</S> out of his temple<S>1964</S>, and my cry<S>7775</S> did enter into his ears<S>241</S>.
Then the earth<S>776</S> shook<S>1607</S> <S>1607</S> and trembled<S>7493</S>; the foundations<S>4146</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> moved<S>7264</S> and shook<S>1607</S>, because he was wroth<S>2734</S>.
There went up<S>5927</S> a smoke<S>6227</S> out of his nostrils<S>639</S>, and fire<S>784</S> out of his mouth<S>6310</S> devoured<S>398</S>: coals<S>1513</S> were kindled<S>1197</S> by it. <sup>out of his nostrils: Heb. by, etc</sup>
He bowed<S>5186</S> the heavens<S>8064</S> also, and came down<S>3381</S>; and darkness<S>6205</S> was under his feet<S>7272</S>.
And he rode<S>7392</S> upon a cherub<S>3742</S>, and did fly<S>5774</S>: and he was seen<S>7200</S> upon the wings<S>3671</S> of the wind<S>7307</S>.
And he made<S>7896</S> darkness<S>2822</S> pavilions<S>5521</S> round about<S>5439</S> him, dark<S>2841</S> waters<S>4325</S>, and thick clouds<S>5645</S> of the skies<S>7834</S>. <sup>dark: Heb. binding of waters</sup>
Through the brightness<S>5051</S> before him were coals<S>1513</S> of fire<S>784</S> kindled<S>1197</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> thundered<S>7481</S> from heaven<S>8064</S>, and the most High<S>5945</S> uttered<S>5414</S> his voice<S>6963</S>.
And he sent out<S>7971</S> arrows<S>2671</S>, and scattered<S>6327</S> them; lightning<S>1300</S>, and discomfited<S>2000</S> them.
And the channels<S>650</S> of the sea<S>3220</S> appeared<S>7200</S>, the foundations<S>4146</S> of the world<S>8398</S> were discovered<S>1540</S>, at the rebuking<S>1606</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, at the blast<S>5397</S> of the breath<S>7307</S> of his nostrils<S>639</S>.
He sent<S>7971</S> from above<S>4791</S>, he took<S>3947</S> me; he drew<S>4871</S> me out of many<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S>; <sup>many: or, great</sup>
He delivered<S>5337</S> me from my strong<S>5794</S> enemy<S>341</S>, and from them that hated<S>8130</S> me: for they were too strong<S>553</S> for me.
They prevented<S>6923</S> me in the day<S>3117</S> of my calamity<S>343</S>: but the LORD<S>3068</S> was my stay<S>4937</S>.
He brought me forth<S>3318</S> also into a large place<S>4800</S>: he delivered<S>2502</S> me, because he delighted<S>2654</S> in me.
The LORD<S>3068</S> rewarded<S>1580</S> me according to my righteousness<S>6666</S>: according to the cleanness<S>1252</S> of my hands<S>3027</S> hath he recompensed<S>7725</S> me.
For I have kept<S>8104</S> the ways<S>1870</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and have not wickedly departed<S>7561</S> from my God<S>430</S>.
For all his judgments<S>4941</S> were before me: and as for his statutes<S>2708</S>, I did not depart<S>5493</S> from them.
I was also upright<S>8549</S> before him, and have kept<S>8104</S> myself from mine iniquity<S>5771</S>. <sup>before: Heb. to</sup>
Therefore the LORD<S>3068</S> hath recompensed<S>7725</S> me according to my righteousness<S>6666</S>; according to my cleanness<S>1252</S> in his eye sight<S>5048</S> <S>5869</S>. <sup>in: Heb. before his eyes</sup>
With the merciful<S>2623</S> thou wilt shew thyself merciful<S>2616</S>, and with the upright<S>8549</S> man<S>1368</S> thou wilt shew thyself upright<S>8552</S>.
With the pure<S>1305</S> thou wilt shew thyself pure<S>1305</S>; and with the froward<S>6141</S> thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury<S>6617</S>. <sup>shew thyself unsavoury: or, wrestle</sup>
And the afflicted<S>6041</S> people<S>5971</S> thou wilt save<S>3467</S>: but thine eyes<S>5869</S> are upon the haughty<S>7311</S>, that thou mayest bring them down<S>8213</S>.
For thou art my lamp<S>5216</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> will lighten<S>5050</S> my darkness<S>2822</S>. <sup>lamp: or, candle</sup>
For by thee I have run<S>7323</S> through a troop<S>1416</S>: by my God<S>430</S> have I leaped over<S>1801</S> a wall<S>7791</S>. <sup>run: or, broken</sup>
As for God<S>410</S>, his way<S>1870</S> is perfect<S>8549</S>; the word<S>565</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is tried<S>6884</S>: he is a buckler<S>4043</S> to all them that trust<S>2620</S> in him. <sup>tried: or, refined</sup>
For who is God<S>410</S>, save<S>1107</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>? and who is a rock<S>6697</S>, save<S>1107</S> our God<S>430</S>?
God<S>410</S> is my strength<S>4581</S> and power<S>2428</S>: and he maketh<S>5425</S> my way<S>1870</S> perfect<S>8549</S>. <sup>maketh: Heb. riddeth, or, looseth</sup>
He maketh<S>7737</S> my feet<S>7272</S> like<S>7737</S> hinds'<S>355</S> feet: and setteth<S>5975</S> me upon my high places<S>1116</S>. <sup>maketh: Heb. equalleth</sup>
He teacheth<S>3925</S> my hands<S>3027</S> to war<S>4421</S>; so that a bow<S>7198</S> of steel<S>5154</S> is broken<S>5181</S> by mine arms<S>2220</S>. <sup>to war: Heb. for the war</sup>
Thou hast also given<S>5414</S> me the shield<S>4043</S> of thy salvation<S>3468</S>: and thy gentleness<S>6031</S> <S>6038</S> hath made me great<S>7235</S>. <sup>made: Heb. multiplied me</sup>
Thou hast enlarged<S>7337</S> my steps<S>6806</S> under me; so that my feet<S>7166</S> did not slip<S>4571</S>. <sup>feet: Heb. ankles</sup>
I have pursued<S>7291</S> mine enemies<S>341</S>, and destroyed<S>8045</S> them; and turned not again<S>7725</S> until I had consumed<S>3615</S> them.
And I have consumed<S>3615</S> them, and wounded<S>4272</S> them, that they could not arise<S>6965</S>: yea, they are fallen<S>5307</S> under my feet<S>7272</S>.
For thou hast girded<S>247</S> me with strength<S>2428</S> to battle<S>4421</S>: them that rose up<S>6965</S> against me hast thou subdued<S>3766</S> under me. <sup>subdued: Heb. caused to bow</sup>
Thou hast also given<S>5414</S> me the necks<S>6203</S> of mine enemies<S>341</S>, that I might destroy<S>6789</S> them that hate<S>8130</S> me.
They looked<S>8159</S>, but there was none to save<S>3467</S>; even unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, but he answered<S>6030</S> them not.
Then did I beat<S>7833</S> them as small as the dust<S>6083</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, I did stamp<S>1854</S> them as the mire<S>2916</S> of the street<S>2351</S>, and did spread them abroad<S>7554</S>.
Thou also hast delivered<S>6403</S> me from the strivings<S>7379</S> of my people<S>5971</S>, thou hast kept<S>8104</S> me to be head<S>7218</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>: a people<S>5971</S> which I knew<S>3045</S> not shall serve<S>5647</S> me.
Strangers<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S> shall submit<S>3584</S> themselves unto me: as soon as they hear<S>8085</S> <S>241</S>, they shall be obedient<S>8085</S> unto me. <sup>Strangers: Heb. Sons of the stranger</sup> <sup>submit: or, yield feigned obedience: Heb. lie</sup>
Strangers<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S> shall fade away<S>5034</S>, and they shall be afraid<S>2296</S> out of their close places<S>4526</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>; and blessed<S>1288</S> be my rock<S>6697</S>; and exalted<S>7311</S> be the God<S>430</S> of the rock<S>6697</S> of my salvation<S>3468</S>.
It is God<S>410</S> that avengeth<S>5414</S> <S>5360</S> me, and that bringeth down<S>3381</S> the people<S>5971</S> under me, <sup>avengeth: Heb. giveth avengement for</sup>
And that bringeth me forth<S>3318</S> from mine enemies<S>341</S>: thou also hast lifted me up on high<S>7311</S> above them that rose up<S>6965</S> against me: thou hast delivered<S>5337</S> me from the violent<S>2555</S> man<S>376</S>.
Therefore I will give thanks<S>3034</S> unto thee, O LORD<S>3068</S>, among the heathen<S>1471</S>, and I will sing praises<S>2167</S> unto thy name<S>8034</S>.

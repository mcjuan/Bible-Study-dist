But Job<S>347</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>,
Hear<S>8085</S> diligently<S>8085</S> my speech<S>4405</S>, and let this be your consolations<S>8575</S>.
Suffer<S>5375</S> me that I may speak<S>1696</S>; and after<S>310</S> that I have spoken<S>1696</S>, mock on<S>3932</S>.
As for me, is my complaint<S>7879</S> to man<S>120</S>? and if it were so, why should not my spirit<S>7307</S> be troubled<S>7114</S>? <sup>troubled: Heb. shortened?</sup>
Mark<S>6437</S> me, and be astonished<S>8074</S>, and lay<S>7760</S> your hand<S>3027</S> upon your mouth<S>6310</S>. <sup>Mark: Heb. Look unto me</sup>
Even when I remember<S>2142</S> I am afraid<S>926</S>, and trembling<S>6427</S> taketh hold on<S>270</S> my flesh<S>1320</S>.
Wherefore do the wicked<S>7563</S> live<S>2421</S>, become old<S>6275</S>, yea, are mighty<S>1396</S> in power<S>2428</S>?
Their seed<S>2233</S> is established<S>3559</S> in their sight<S>6440</S> with them, and their offspring<S>6631</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>.
Their houses<S>1004</S> are safe<S>7965</S> from fear<S>6343</S>, neither is the rod<S>7626</S> of God<S>433</S> upon them. <sup>safe: Heb. peace from</sup>
Their bull<S>7794</S> gendereth<S>5674</S>, and faileth<S>1602</S> not; their cow<S>6510</S> calveth<S>6403</S>, and casteth not her calf<S>7921</S>.
They send forth<S>7971</S> their little ones<S>5759</S> like a flock<S>6629</S>, and their children<S>3206</S> dance<S>7540</S>.
They take<S>5375</S> the timbrel<S>8596</S> and harp<S>3658</S>, and rejoice<S>8055</S> at the sound<S>6963</S> of the organ<S>5748</S>.
They spend<S>3615</S> <S>1086</S> their days<S>3117</S> in wealth<S>2896</S>, and in a moment<S>7281</S> go down<S>2865</S> <S>5181</S> to the grave<S>7585</S>. <sup>in wealth: or, in mirth</sup>
Therefore they say<S>559</S> unto God<S>410</S>, Depart<S>5493</S> from us; for we desire<S>2654</S> not the knowledge<S>1847</S> of thy ways<S>1870</S>.
What is the Almighty<S>7706</S>, that we should serve<S>5647</S> him? and what profit<S>3276</S> should we have, if we pray<S>6293</S> unto him?
Lo, their good<S>2898</S> is not in their hand<S>3027</S>: the counsel<S>6098</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S> is far<S>7368</S> from me.
How oft is the candle<S>5216</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S> put out<S>1846</S>! and how oft cometh<S>935</S> their destruction<S>343</S> upon them! God distributeth<S>2505</S> sorrows<S>2256</S> in his anger<S>639</S>. <sup>candle: or, lamp</sup>
They are as stubble<S>8401</S> before<S>6440</S> the wind<S>7307</S>, and as chaff<S>4671</S> that the storm<S>5492</S> carrieth away<S>1589</S>. <sup>carrieth: Heb. stealeth</sup>
God<S>433</S> layeth up<S>6845</S> his iniquity<S>205</S> for his children<S>1121</S>: he rewardeth<S>7999</S> him, and he shall know<S>3045</S> it. <sup>his iniquity: that is, the punishment of his iniquity</sup>
His eyes<S>5869</S> shall see<S>7200</S> his destruction<S>3589</S>, and he shall drink<S>8354</S> of the wrath<S>2534</S> of the Almighty<S>7706</S>.
For what pleasure<S>2656</S> hath he in his house<S>1004</S> after<S>310</S> him, when the number<S>4557</S> of his months<S>2320</S> is cut off in the midst<S>2686</S>?
Shall any teach<S>3925</S> God<S>410</S> knowledge<S>1847</S>? seeing he judgeth<S>8199</S> those that are high<S>7311</S>.
One dieth<S>4191</S> in his full<S>8537</S> strength<S>6106</S>, being wholly at ease<S>7946</S> and quiet<S>7961</S>. <sup>his: Heb. his very, or, the strength of, his perfection</sup>
His breasts<S>5845</S> are full<S>4390</S> of milk<S>2461</S>, and his bones<S>6106</S> are moistened<S>8248</S> with marrow<S>4221</S>. <sup>breasts: or, milk pails</sup>
And another dieth<S>4191</S> in the bitterness<S>4751</S> of his soul<S>5315</S>, and never eateth<S>398</S> with pleasure<S>2896</S>.
They shall lie down<S>7901</S> alike<S>3162</S> in the dust<S>6083</S>, and the worms<S>7415</S> shall cover<S>3680</S> them.
Behold, I know<S>3045</S> your thoughts<S>4284</S>, and the devices<S>4209</S> which ye wrongfully imagine<S>2554</S> against me.
For ye say<S>559</S>, Where is the house<S>1004</S> of the prince<S>5081</S>? and where are the dwelling<S>4908</S> places<S>168</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>? <sup>the dwelling: Heb. the tent of the tabernacles</sup>
Have ye not asked<S>7592</S> them that go<S>5674</S> by the way<S>1870</S>? and do ye not know<S>5234</S> their tokens<S>226</S>,
That the wicked<S>7451</S> is reserved<S>2820</S> to the day<S>3117</S> of destruction<S>343</S>? they shall be brought forth<S>2986</S> to the day<S>3117</S> of wrath<S>5678</S>. <sup>wrath: Heb. wraths</sup>
Who shall declare<S>5046</S> his way<S>1870</S> to his face<S>6440</S>? and who shall repay<S>7999</S> him what he hath done<S>6213</S>?
Yet shall he be brought<S>2986</S> to the grave<S>6913</S>, and shall remain<S>8245</S> in the tomb<S>1430</S>. <sup>grave: Heb. graves</sup> <sup>remain: Heb. watch in the heap</sup>
The clods<S>7263</S> of the valley<S>5158</S> shall be sweet<S>4985</S> unto him, and every man<S>120</S> shall draw<S>4900</S> after<S>310</S> him, as there are innumerable<S>4557</S> before<S>6440</S> him.
How then comfort<S>5162</S> ye me in vain<S>1892</S>, seeing in your answers<S>8666</S> there remaineth<S>7604</S> falsehood<S>4604</S>? <sup>falsehood: Heb. transgression?</sup>

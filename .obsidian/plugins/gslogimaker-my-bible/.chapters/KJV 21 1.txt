The words<S>1697</S> of the Preacher<S>6953</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of David<S>1732</S>, king<S>4428</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Vanity<S>1892</S> of vanities<S>1892</S>, saith<S>559</S> the Preacher<S>6953</S>, vanity<S>1892</S> of vanities<S>1892</S>; all is vanity<S>1892</S>.
What profit<S>3504</S> hath a man<S>120</S> of all his labour<S>5999</S> which he taketh<S>5998</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>?
One generation<S>1755</S> passeth away<S>1980</S>, and another generation<S>1755</S> cometh<S>935</S> <S>935</S>: but the earth<S>776</S> abideth<S>5975</S> for ever<S>5769</S>.
The sun<S>8121</S> also ariseth<S>2224</S>, and the sun<S>8121</S> goeth down<S>935</S>, and hasteth<S>7602</S> to his place<S>4725</S> where he arose<S>2224</S>. <sup>hasteth: Heb. panteth</sup>
The wind<S>7307</S> goeth<S>1980</S> toward the south<S>1864</S>, and turneth about<S>5437</S> unto the north<S>6828</S>; it whirleth about continually<S>1980</S>, and the wind<S>7307</S> returneth again<S>7725</S> according to his circuits<S>5439</S>.
All the rivers<S>5158</S> run<S>1980</S> into the sea<S>3220</S>; yet the sea<S>3220</S> is not full<S>4392</S>; unto the place<S>4725</S> from whence the rivers<S>5158</S> come<S>1980</S>, thither they return<S>7725</S> again<S>3212</S>. <sup>return: Heb. return to go</sup>
All things<S>1697</S> are full of labour<S>3023</S>; man<S>376</S> cannot<S>3201</S> utter<S>1696</S> it: the eye<S>5869</S> is not satisfied<S>7646</S> with seeing<S>7200</S>, nor the ear<S>241</S> filled<S>4390</S> with hearing<S>8085</S>.
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done<S>6213</S> is that which shall be done<S>6213</S>: and there is no new<S>2319</S> thing under the sun<S>8121</S>.
Is there<S>3426</S> any thing<S>1697</S> whereof it may be said<S>559</S>, See<S>7200</S>, this is new<S>2319</S>? it hath been already<S>3528</S> of old time<S>5769</S>, which was before<S>6440</S> us.
There is no remembrance<S>2146</S> of former<S>7223</S> things; neither shall there be any remembrance<S>2146</S> of things that are to come<S>314</S> with those that shall come after<S>314</S>.
I the Preacher<S>6953</S> was king<S>4428</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And I gave<S>5414</S> my heart<S>3820</S> to seek<S>1875</S> and search out<S>8446</S> by wisdom<S>2451</S> concerning all things that are done<S>6213</S> under heaven<S>8064</S>: this sore<S>7451</S> travail<S>6045</S> hath God<S>430</S> given<S>5414</S> to the sons<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S> to be exercised<S>6031</S> therewith. <sup>to be: or, to afflict them</sup>
I have seen<S>7200</S> all the works<S>4639</S> that are done<S>6213</S> under the sun<S>8121</S>; and, behold, all is vanity<S>1892</S> and vexation<S>7469</S> of spirit<S>7307</S>.
That which is crooked<S>5791</S> cannot<S>3201</S> be made straight<S>8626</S>: and that which is wanting<S>2642</S> cannot<S>3201</S> be numbered<S>4487</S>. <sup>that which is wanting: Heb. defect</sup>
I communed<S>1696</S> with mine own heart<S>3820</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Lo, I am come to great estate<S>1431</S>, and have gotten<S>3254</S> more wisdom<S>2451</S> than all they that have been before<S>6440</S> me in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: yea, my heart<S>3820</S> had great<S>7235</S> experience<S>7200</S> of wisdom<S>2451</S> and knowledge<S>1847</S>. <sup>had: Heb. had seen much</sup>
And I gave<S>5414</S> my heart<S>3820</S> to know<S>3045</S> wisdom<S>2451</S>, and to know<S>3045</S> madness<S>1947</S> and folly<S>5531</S>: I perceived<S>3045</S> that this<S>1571</S> also is vexation<S>7475</S> of spirit<S>7307</S>.
For in much<S>7230</S> wisdom<S>2451</S> is much<S>7230</S> grief<S>3708</S>: and he that increaseth<S>3254</S> knowledge<S>1847</S> increaseth<S>3254</S> sorrow<S>4341</S>.

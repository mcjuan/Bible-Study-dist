And they took their journey<S>5265</S> from Elim<S>362</S>, and all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came<S>935</S> unto the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Sin<S>5512</S>, which is between Elim<S>362</S> and Sinai<S>5514</S>, on the fifteenth<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> day<S>3117</S> of the second<S>8145</S> month<S>2320</S> after their departing out<S>3318</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And the whole congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> murmured<S>3885</S> against Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>:
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Would to God<S>4310</S> <S>5414</S> we had died<S>4191</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, when we sat<S>3427</S> by the flesh<S>1320</S> pots<S>5518</S>, and when we did eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> to the full<S>7648</S>; for ye have brought us forth<S>3318</S> into this wilderness<S>4057</S>, to kill<S>4191</S> this whole assembly<S>6951</S> with hunger<S>7458</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Behold, I will rain<S>4305</S> bread<S>3899</S> from heaven<S>8064</S> for you; and the people<S>5971</S> shall go out<S>3318</S> and gather<S>3950</S> a certain rate<S>1697</S> every day<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S>, that I may prove<S>5254</S> them, whether they will walk<S>3212</S> in my law<S>8451</S>, or no. <sup>a certain: Heb. the portion of a day in his day</sup>
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth<S>8345</S> day<S>3117</S> they shall prepare<S>3559</S> that which<S>834</S> they bring in<S>935</S>; and it shall be twice<S>4932</S> as much as they gather<S>3950</S> daily<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> said<S>559</S> unto all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, At even<S>6153</S>, then ye shall know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath brought you out<S>3318</S> from the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>:
And in the morning<S>1242</S>, then ye shall see<S>7200</S> the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; for that he heareth<S>8085</S> your murmurings<S>8519</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>: and what are we<S>5168</S>, that ye murmur<S>3885</S> <S>3885</S> against us?
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, This shall be, when the LORD<S>3068</S> shall give<S>5414</S> you in the evening<S>6153</S> flesh<S>1320</S> to eat<S>398</S>, and in the morning<S>1242</S> bread<S>3899</S> to the full<S>7646</S>; for that the LORD<S>3068</S> heareth<S>8085</S> your murmurings<S>8519</S> which ye murmur<S>3885</S> against him: and what are we<S>5168</S>? your murmurings<S>8519</S> are not against us, but against the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Say<S>559</S> unto all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Come near<S>7126</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: for he hath heard<S>8085</S> your murmurings<S>8519</S>.
And it came to pass, as Aaron<S>175</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto the whole congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that they looked<S>6437</S> toward the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and, behold, the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> appeared<S>7200</S> in the cloud<S>6051</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
I have heard<S>8085</S> the murmurings<S>8519</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: speak<S>1696</S> unto them, saying<S>559</S>, At even<S>996</S> <S>6153</S> ye shall eat<S>398</S> flesh<S>1320</S>, and in the morning<S>1242</S> ye shall be filled<S>7646</S> with bread<S>3899</S>; and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>.
And it came to pass, that at even<S>6153</S> the quails<S>7958</S> came up<S>5927</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> the camp<S>4264</S>: and in the morning<S>1242</S> the dew<S>2919</S> lay<S>7902</S> round about<S>5439</S> the host<S>4264</S>.
And when the dew<S>2919</S> that lay<S>7902</S> was gone up<S>5927</S>, behold, upon the face<S>6440</S> of the wilderness<S>4057</S> there lay a small<S>1851</S> round thing<S>2636</S>, as small<S>1851</S> as the hoar frost<S>3713</S> on the ground<S>776</S>.
And when the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> saw<S>7200</S> it, they said<S>559</S> one<S>376</S> to another<S>251</S>, It is manna<S>4478</S>: for they wist<S>3045</S> not what it was. And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, This is the bread<S>3899</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> you to eat<S>402</S>. <sup>It is: or, What is this? or, It is a portion</sup>
This is the thing<S>1697</S> which<S>834</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S>, Gather<S>3950</S> of it every man<S>376</S> according<S>6310</S> to his eating<S>400</S>, an omer<S>6016</S> for every man<S>1538</S>, according to the number<S>4557</S> of your persons<S>5315</S>; take<S>3947</S> ye every man<S>376</S> for them which are in his tents<S>168</S>. <sup>for every: Heb. by the poll, or, head</sup> <sup>persons: Heb. souls</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> so, and gathered<S>3950</S>, some more<S>7235</S>, some less<S>4591</S>.
And when they did mete<S>4058</S> it with an omer<S>6016</S>, he that gathered much<S>7235</S> had nothing over<S>5736</S>, and he that gathered little<S>4591</S> had no lack<S>2637</S>; they gathered<S>3950</S> every man<S>376</S> according<S>6310</S> to his eating<S>400</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Let no man<S>376</S> leave<S>3498</S> of it till the morning<S>1242</S>.
Notwithstanding they hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto Moses<S>4872</S>; but some<S>582</S> of them left<S>3498</S> of it until the morning<S>1242</S>, and it bred<S>7311</S> worms<S>8438</S>, and stank<S>887</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> was wroth<S>7107</S> with them.
And they gathered<S>3950</S> it every morning<S>1242</S>, every man<S>376</S> according<S>6310</S> to his eating<S>400</S>: and when the sun<S>8121</S> waxed hot<S>2552</S>, it melted<S>4549</S>.
And it came to pass, that on the sixth<S>8345</S> day<S>3117</S> they gathered<S>3950</S> twice<S>4932</S> as much bread<S>3899</S>, two<S>8147</S> omers<S>6016</S> for one<S>259</S> man: and all the rulers<S>5387</S> of the congregation<S>5712</S> came<S>935</S> and told<S>5046</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, This is that which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>1696</S>, To morrow<S>4279</S> is the rest<S>7677</S> of the holy<S>6944</S> sabbath<S>7676</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: bake<S>644</S> that which ye will bake<S>644</S> to day, and seethe<S>1310</S> that ye will seethe<S>1310</S>; and that which<S>3605</S> remaineth over<S>5736</S> lay up<S>3240</S> for you to be kept<S>4931</S> until the morning<S>1242</S>.
And they laid it up<S>3240</S> till the morning<S>1242</S>, as Moses<S>4872</S> bade<S>6680</S>: and it did not stink<S>887</S>, neither was there any worm<S>7415</S> therein.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, Eat<S>398</S> that to day<S>3117</S>; for to day<S>3117</S> is a sabbath<S>7676</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: to day<S>3117</S> ye shall not find<S>4672</S> it in the field<S>7704</S>.
Six<S>8337</S> days<S>3117</S> ye shall gather<S>3950</S> it; but on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, which is the sabbath<S>7676</S>, in it there shall be none.
And it came to pass, that there went out<S>3318</S> some of the people<S>5971</S> on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> for to gather<S>3950</S>, and they found<S>4672</S> none.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, How long refuse<S>3985</S> ye to keep<S>8104</S> my commandments<S>4687</S> and my laws<S>8451</S>?
See<S>7200</S>, for that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> you the sabbath<S>7676</S>, therefore he giveth<S>5414</S> you on the sixth<S>8345</S> day<S>3117</S> the bread<S>3899</S> of two days<S>3117</S>; abide<S>3427</S> ye every man<S>376</S> in his place, let no man<S>376</S> go out<S>3318</S> of his place<S>4725</S> on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>.
So the people<S>5971</S> rested<S>7673</S> on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>.
And the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> thereof Manna<S>4478</S>: and it was like coriander<S>1407</S> seed<S>2233</S>, white<S>3836</S>; and the taste<S>2940</S> of it was like wafers<S>6838</S> made with honey<S>1706</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S>, This is the thing<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> commandeth<S>6680</S>, Fill<S>4393</S> an omer<S>6016</S> of it to be kept<S>4931</S> for your generations<S>1755</S>; that they may see<S>7200</S> the bread<S>3899</S> wherewith I have fed<S>398</S> you in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, when I brought you forth<S>3318</S> from the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Take<S>3947</S> a<S>259</S> pot<S>6803</S>, and put<S>5414</S> an omer<S>6016</S> full<S>4393</S> of manna<S>4478</S> therein, and lay it up<S>3240</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to be kept<S>4931</S> for your generations<S>1755</S>.
As the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, so Aaron<S>175</S> laid it up<S>3240</S> before<S>6440</S> the Testimony<S>5715</S>, to be kept<S>4931</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did eat<S>398</S> manna<S>4478</S> forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S>, until they came<S>935</S> to a land<S>776</S> inhabited<S>3427</S>; they did eat<S>398</S> manna<S>4478</S>, until they came<S>935</S> unto the borders<S>7097</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>.
Now an omer<S>6016</S> is the tenth<S>6224</S> part of an ephah<S>374</S>.

And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
This month<S>2320</S> shall be unto you the beginning<S>7218</S> of months<S>2320</S>: it shall be the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S> of the year<S>8141</S> to you.
Speak<S>1696</S> ye unto all the congregation<S>5712</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, In the tenth<S>6218</S> day of this month<S>2320</S> they shall take<S>3947</S> to them every man<S>376</S> a lamb<S>7716</S>, according to the house<S>1004</S> of their fathers<S>1</S>, a lamb<S>7716</S> for an house<S>1004</S>: <sup>lamb: or, kid</sup>
And if the household<S>1004</S> be<S>1961</S> too little<S>4591</S> for the lamb<S>7716</S>, let him and his neighbour<S>7934</S> next<S>7138</S> unto his house<S>1004</S> take<S>3947</S> it according to the number<S>4373</S> of the souls<S>5315</S>; every man<S>376</S> according<S>6310</S> to his eating<S>400</S> shall make your count<S>3699</S> for the lamb<S>7716</S>.
Your lamb<S>7716</S> shall be without blemish<S>8549</S>, a male<S>2145</S> of the first<S>1121</S> year<S>8141</S>: ye shall take<S>3947</S> it out from the sheep<S>3532</S>, or from the goats<S>5795</S>: <sup>of: Heb. son of a year</sup>
And ye shall keep<S>4931</S> it up until the fourteenth<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> day<S>3117</S> of the same month<S>2320</S>: and the whole<S>3605</S> assembly<S>6951</S> of the congregation<S>5712</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall kill<S>7819</S> it in<S>996</S> the evening<S>6153</S>. <sup>in: Heb. between the two evenings</sup>
And they shall take<S>3947</S> of the blood<S>1818</S>, and strike<S>5414</S> it on the two<S>8147</S> side posts<S>4201</S> and on the upper door post<S>4947</S> of the houses<S>1004</S>, wherein they shall eat<S>398</S> it.
And they shall eat<S>398</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> in that night<S>3915</S>, roast<S>6748</S> with fire<S>784</S>, and unleavened bread<S>4682</S>; and with bitter<S>4844</S> herbs they shall eat<S>398</S> it.
Eat<S>398</S> not of it raw<S>4995</S>, nor sodden<S>1310</S> <S>1311</S> at all with water<S>4325</S>, but roast<S>6748</S> with fire<S>784</S>; his head<S>7218</S> with his legs<S>3767</S>, and with the purtenance<S>7130</S> thereof.
And ye shall let nothing of it remain<S>3498</S> until the morning<S>1242</S>; and that which remaineth<S>3498</S> of it until the morning<S>1242</S> ye shall burn<S>8313</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
And thus<S>3602</S> shall ye eat<S>398</S> it; with your loins<S>4975</S> girded<S>2296</S>, your shoes<S>5275</S> on your feet<S>7272</S>, and your staff<S>4731</S> in your hand<S>3027</S>; and ye shall eat<S>398</S> it in haste<S>2649</S>: it is the LORD'S<S>3068</S> passover<S>6453</S>.
For I will pass<S>5674</S> through the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> this night<S>3915</S>, and will smite<S>5221</S> all the firstborn<S>1060</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, both man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S>; and against all the gods<S>430</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> I will execute<S>6213</S> judgment<S>8201</S>: I am the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>gods: or, princes</sup>
And the blood<S>1818</S> shall be to you for a token<S>226</S> upon the houses<S>1004</S> where ye are: and when I see<S>7200</S> the blood<S>1818</S>, I will pass<S>6452</S> over you, and the plague<S>5063</S> shall not be upon you to destroy<S>4889</S> you, when I smite<S>5221</S> the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. <sup>to destroy: Heb. for a destruction</sup>
And this day<S>3117</S> shall be unto you for a memorial<S>2146</S>; and ye shall keep<S>2287</S> it a feast<S>2282</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S> throughout your generations<S>1755</S>; ye shall keep it a feast<S>2287</S> by an ordinance<S>2708</S> for ever<S>5769</S>.
Seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> shall ye eat<S>398</S> unleavened bread<S>4682</S>; even<S>389</S> the first<S>7223</S> day<S>3117</S> ye shall put away<S>7673</S> leaven<S>7603</S> out of your houses<S>1004</S>: for whosoever eateth<S>398</S> leavened bread<S>2557</S> from the first<S>7223</S> day<S>3117</S> until the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, that soul<S>5315</S> shall be cut<S>3772</S> off from Israel<S>3478</S>.
And in the first<S>7223</S> day<S>3117</S> there shall be an holy<S>6944</S> convocation<S>4744</S>, and in the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> there shall be an holy<S>6944</S> convocation<S>4744</S> to you; no manner of work<S>4399</S> shall be done<S>6213</S> in them, save<S>389</S> that which every man<S>5315</S> must eat<S>398</S>, that only may be done<S>6213</S> of you. <sup>man: Heb. soul</sup>
And ye shall observe<S>8104</S> the feast of unleavened bread<S>4682</S>; for in this selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S> have I brought<S>3318</S> your armies<S>6635</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>: therefore shall ye observe<S>8104</S> this day<S>3117</S> in your generations<S>1755</S> by an ordinance<S>2708</S> for ever<S>5769</S>.
In the first<S>7223</S> month, on the fourteenth<S>6240</S> <S>702</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S> at even<S>6153</S>, ye shall eat<S>398</S> unleavened bread<S>4682</S>, until the one<S>259</S> and twentieth<S>6242</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S> at even<S>6153</S>.
Seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> shall there be no leaven<S>7603</S> found<S>4672</S> in your houses<S>1004</S>: for whosoever eateth<S>398</S> that which is leavened<S>2556</S>, even that soul<S>5315</S> shall be cut off<S>3772</S> from the congregation<S>5712</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, whether he be a stranger<S>1616</S>, or born<S>249</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
Ye shall eat<S>398</S> nothing leavened<S>2556</S>; in all your habitations<S>4186</S> shall ye eat<S>398</S> unleavened bread<S>4682</S>.
Then Moses<S>4872</S> called<S>7121</S> for all the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Draw out<S>4900</S> and take<S>3947</S> you a lamb<S>6629</S> according to your families<S>4940</S>, and kill<S>7819</S> the passover<S>6453</S>. <sup>lamb: or, kid</sup>
And ye shall take<S>3947</S> a bunch<S>92</S> of hyssop<S>231</S>, and dip<S>2881</S> it in the blood<S>1818</S> that is in the bason<S>5592</S>, and strike<S>5060</S> the lintel<S>4947</S> and the two<S>8147</S> side posts<S>4201</S> with the blood<S>1818</S> that is in the bason<S>5592</S>; and none<S>376</S> of you shall go out<S>3318</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of his house<S>1004</S> until the morning<S>1242</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> will pass through<S>5674</S> to smite<S>5062</S> the Egyptians<S>4714</S>; and when he seeth<S>7200</S> the blood<S>1818</S> upon the lintel<S>4947</S>, and on the two<S>8147</S> side posts<S>4201</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> will pass over<S>6452</S> the door<S>6607</S>, and will not suffer<S>5414</S> the destroyer<S>7843</S> to come<S>935</S> in unto your houses<S>1004</S> to smite<S>5062</S> you.
And ye shall observe<S>8104</S> this thing<S>1697</S> for an ordinance<S>2706</S> to thee and to thy sons<S>1121</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come<S>935</S> to the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> will give<S>5414</S> you, according as he hath promised<S>1696</S>, that ye shall keep<S>8104</S> this service<S>5656</S>.
And it shall come to pass, when your children<S>1121</S> shall say<S>559</S> unto you, What mean ye by this service<S>5656</S>?
That ye shall say<S>559</S>, It is the sacrifice<S>2077</S> of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> passover<S>6453</S>, who passed<S>6452</S> over the houses<S>1004</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, when he smote<S>5062</S> the Egyptians<S>4714</S>, and delivered<S>5337</S> our houses<S>1004</S>. And the people<S>5971</S> bowed the head<S>6915</S> and worshipped<S>7812</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went away<S>3212</S>, and did<S>6213</S> as the LORD<S>3068</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, so did<S>6213</S> they.
And it came to pass, that at midnight<S>2677</S> <S>3915</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> smote<S>5221</S> all the firstborn<S>1060</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, from the firstborn<S>1060</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> that sat<S>3427</S> on his throne<S>3678</S> unto the firstborn<S>1060</S> of the captive<S>7628</S> that was in the dungeon<S>1004</S> <S>953</S>; and all the firstborn<S>1060</S> of cattle<S>929</S>. <sup>dungeon: Heb. house of the pit</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> rose up<S>6965</S> in the night<S>3915</S>, he, and all his servants<S>5650</S>, and all the Egyptians<S>4714</S>; and there was a great<S>1419</S> cry<S>6818</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>; for there was not a house<S>1004</S> where there was not one dead<S>4191</S>.
And he called<S>7121</S> for Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> by night<S>3915</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Rise up<S>6965</S>, and get you forth<S>3318</S> from among<S>8432</S> my people<S>5971</S>, both ye and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; and go<S>3212</S>, serve<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, as ye have said<S>1696</S>.
Also take<S>3947</S> your flocks<S>6629</S> and your herds<S>1241</S>, as ye have said<S>1696</S>, and be gone<S>3212</S>; and bless<S>1288</S> me also.
And the Egyptians<S>4714</S> were urgent<S>2388</S> upon the people<S>5971</S>, that they might send<S>7971</S> them out of the land<S>776</S> in haste<S>4116</S>; for they said<S>559</S>, We be all dead<S>4191</S> men.
And the people<S>5971</S> took<S>5375</S> their dough<S>1217</S> before it was leavened<S>2556</S>, their kneadingtroughs<S>4863</S> being bound up<S>6887</S> in their clothes<S>8071</S> upon their shoulders<S>7926</S>. <sup>kneadingtroughs: or, dough</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>; and they borrowed<S>7592</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S> jewels<S>3627</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and jewels<S>3627</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, and raiment<S>8071</S>:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> gave<S>5414</S> the people<S>5971</S> favour<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the Egyptians<S>4714</S>, so that they lent<S>7592</S> unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled<S>5337</S> the Egyptians<S>4714</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> journeyed<S>5265</S> from Rameses<S>7486</S> to Succoth<S>5523</S>, about six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> thousand<S>505</S> on foot<S>7273</S> that were men<S>1397</S>, beside<S>905</S> children<S>2945</S>.
And a mixed<S>6154</S> multitude<S>7227</S> went up<S>5927</S> also with them; and flocks<S>6629</S>, and herds<S>1241</S>, even very<S>3966</S> much<S>3515</S> cattle<S>4735</S>. <sup>a mixed: Heb. a great mixture</sup>
And they baked<S>644</S> unleavened<S>4682</S> cakes<S>5692</S> of the dough<S>1217</S> which they brought forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, for it was not leavened<S>2556</S>; because they were thrust out<S>1644</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and could<S>3201</S> not tarry<S>4102</S>, neither had they prepared<S>6213</S> for themselves any victual<S>6720</S>.
Now the sojourning<S>4186</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, who dwelt<S>3427</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, was four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And it came to pass at the end<S>7093</S> of the four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> years<S>8141</S>, even the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S> it came to pass, that all the hosts<S>6635</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> went out<S>3318</S> from the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
It is a night<S>3915</S> to be much observed<S>8107</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> for bringing<S>3318</S> them out from the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>: this is that night<S>3915</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> to be observed<S>8107</S> of all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in their generations<S>1755</S>. <sup>a night: Heb. a night of observations</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, This is the ordinance<S>2708</S> of the passover<S>6453</S>: There shall no stranger<S>1121</S> <S>5236</S> eat<S>398</S> thereof:
But every man's<S>376</S> servant<S>5650</S> that is bought<S>4736</S> for money<S>3701</S>, when thou hast circumcised<S>4135</S> him, then shall he eat<S>398</S> thereof.
A foreigner<S>8453</S> and an hired servant<S>7916</S> shall not eat<S>398</S> thereof.

All the congregation<S>5712</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall keep<S>6213</S> it. <sup>keep: Heb. do it</sup>
And when a stranger<S>1616</S> shall sojourn<S>1481</S> with thee, and will keep<S>6213</S> the passover<S>6453</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>, let all his males<S>2145</S> be circumcised<S>4135</S>, and then let him come near<S>7126</S> and keep<S>6213</S> it; and he shall be as one that is born<S>249</S> in the land<S>776</S>: for no uncircumcised person<S>6189</S> shall eat<S>398</S> thereof.
One<S>259</S> law<S>8451</S> shall be to him that is homeborn<S>249</S>, and unto the stranger<S>1616</S> that sojourneth<S>1481</S> among<S>8432</S> you.
Thus did<S>6213</S> all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, so did<S>6213</S> they.
And it came to pass the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S>, that the LORD<S>3068</S> did bring<S>3318</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> by their armies<S>6635</S>.

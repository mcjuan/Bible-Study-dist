Jotham<S>3147</S> was twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. His mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> also was Jerushah<S>3388</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, according to all that his father<S>1</S> Uzziah<S>5818</S> did<S>6213</S>: howbeit he entered<S>935</S> not into the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. And the people<S>5971</S> did yet corruptly<S>7843</S>.
He built<S>1129</S> the high<S>5945</S> gate<S>8179</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and on the wall<S>2346</S> of Ophel<S>6077</S> he built<S>1129</S> much<S>7230</S>. <sup>Ophel: or, the tower</sup>
Moreover he built<S>1129</S> cities<S>5892</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the forests<S>2793</S> he built<S>1129</S> castles<S>1003</S> and towers<S>4026</S>.
He fought<S>3898</S> also with the king<S>4428</S> of the Ammonites<S>5984</S>, and prevailed<S>2388</S> against them. And the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> gave<S>5414</S> him the same year<S>8141</S> an hundred<S>3967</S> talents<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> measures<S>3734</S> of wheat<S>2406</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> of barley<S>8184</S>. So much did the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> pay<S>7725</S> unto<S>2063</S> him, both the second<S>8145</S> year<S>8141</S>, and the third<S>7992</S>. <sup>So: Heb. This</sup>
So Jotham<S>3147</S> became mighty<S>2388</S>, because he prepared<S>3559</S> his ways<S>1870</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>. <sup>prepared: or, established</sup>
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Jotham<S>3147</S>, and all his wars<S>4421</S>, and his ways<S>1870</S>, lo, they are written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and Judah<S>3063</S>.
He was five<S>2568</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> sixteen<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And Jotham<S>3147</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and they buried<S>6912</S> him in the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>: and Ahaz<S>271</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.

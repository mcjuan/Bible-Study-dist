To the chief Musician<S>5329</S> upon Mahalath<S>4257</S>, Maschil<S>4905</S>, A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>. The fool<S>5036</S> hath said<S>559</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, There is no God<S>430</S>. Corrupt<S>7843</S> are they, and have done abominable<S>8581</S> iniquity<S>5766</S>: there is none that doeth<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>.
God<S>430</S> looked down<S>8259</S> from heaven<S>8064</S> upon the children<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, to see<S>7200</S> if there were<S>3426</S> any that did understand<S>7919</S>, that did seek<S>1875</S> God<S>430</S>.
Every one of them is gone back<S>5472</S>: they are altogether<S>3162</S> become filthy<S>444</S>; there is none that doeth<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>, no, not one<S>259</S>.
Have the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S> no knowledge<S>3045</S>? who eat up<S>398</S> my people<S>5971</S> as they eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>: they have not called<S>7121</S> upon God<S>430</S>.
There were they in great<S>6343</S> fear<S>6342</S>, where no fear<S>6343</S> was: for God<S>430</S> hath scattered<S>6340</S> the bones<S>6106</S> of him that encampeth<S>2583</S> against thee: thou hast put them to shame<S>954</S>, because God<S>430</S> hath despised<S>3988</S> them. <sup>were: Heb. they feared a fear</sup>
Oh that<S>5414</S> the salvation<S>3444</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were come out of Zion<S>6726</S>! When God<S>430</S> bringeth back<S>7725</S> the captivity<S>7622</S> of his people<S>5971</S>, Jacob<S>3290</S> shall rejoice<S>1523</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> shall be glad<S>8055</S>. <sup>Oh that: Heb. Who will give salvation, etc</sup>

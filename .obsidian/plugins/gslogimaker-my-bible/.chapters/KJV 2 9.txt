Then the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Go<S>935</S> in unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and tell<S>1696</S> him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S>, Let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me.
For if thou refuse<S>3986</S> to let them go<S>7971</S>, and wilt hold<S>2388</S> them still,
Behold, the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is<S>1961</S> upon thy cattle<S>4735</S> which is in the field<S>7704</S>, upon the horses<S>5483</S>, upon the asses<S>2543</S>, upon the camels<S>1581</S>, upon the oxen<S>1241</S>, and upon the sheep<S>6629</S>: there shall be a very<S>3966</S> grievous<S>3515</S> murrain<S>1698</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> shall sever<S>6395</S> between the cattle<S>4735</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and the cattle<S>4735</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>: and there shall nothing<S>1697</S> die<S>4191</S> of all that is the children's<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> appointed<S>7760</S> a set time<S>4150</S>, saying<S>559</S>, To morrow<S>4279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> shall do<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> did<S>6213</S> that thing<S>1697</S> on the morrow<S>4283</S>, and all the cattle<S>4735</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> died<S>4191</S>: but of the cattle<S>4735</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> died<S>4191</S> not one<S>259</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> sent<S>7971</S>, and, behold, there was not one<S>259</S> of the cattle<S>4735</S> of the Israelites<S>3478</S> dead<S>4191</S>. And the heart<S>3820</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> was hardened<S>3513</S>, and he did not let the people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and unto Aaron<S>175</S>, Take<S>3947</S> to you handfuls<S>2651</S> <S>4393</S> of ashes<S>6368</S> of the furnace<S>3536</S>, and let Moses<S>4872</S> sprinkle<S>2236</S> it toward the heaven<S>8064</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And it shall become small dust<S>80</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and shall be a boil<S>7822</S> breaking forth<S>6524</S> with blains<S>76</S> upon man<S>120</S>, and upon beast<S>929</S>, throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And they took<S>3947</S> ashes<S>6368</S> of the furnace<S>3536</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>; and Moses<S>4872</S> sprinkled<S>2236</S> it up toward heaven<S>8064</S>; and it became a boil<S>7822</S> breaking forth<S>6524</S> with blains<S>76</S> upon man<S>120</S>, and upon beast<S>929</S>.
And the magicians<S>2748</S> could<S>3201</S> not stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Moses<S>4872</S> because<S>6440</S> of the boils<S>7822</S>; for the boil<S>7822</S> was upon the magicians<S>2748</S>, and upon all the Egyptians<S>4714</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hardened<S>2388</S> the heart<S>3820</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and he hearkened<S>8085</S> not unto them; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had spoken<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Rise up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and stand<S>3320</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of the Hebrews<S>5680</S>, Let my people<S>5971</S> go<S>7971</S>, that they may serve<S>5647</S> me.
For I will at this time<S>6471</S> send<S>7971</S> all my plagues<S>4046</S> upon thine heart<S>3820</S>, and upon thy servants<S>5650</S>, and upon thy people<S>5971</S>; that thou mayest know<S>3045</S> that there is none like me in all the earth<S>776</S>.
For now I will stretch out<S>7971</S> my hand<S>3027</S>, that I may smite<S>5221</S> thee and thy people<S>5971</S> with pestilence<S>1698</S>; and thou shalt be cut off<S>3582</S> from the earth<S>776</S>.
And in very<S>199</S> deed<S>5668</S> for this cause have I raised thee up<S>5975</S>, for to shew<S>7200</S> in thee my power<S>3581</S>; and that my name<S>8034</S> may be declared<S>5608</S> throughout all the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>raised: Heb. made thee stand</sup>
As yet exaltest<S>5549</S> thou thyself against my people<S>5971</S>, that thou wilt not let them go<S>7971</S>?
Behold, to morrow<S>4279</S> about this time<S>6256</S> I will cause it to rain<S>4305</S> a very<S>3966</S> grievous<S>3515</S> hail<S>1259</S>, such as hath not been<S>3644</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S> since<S>4480</S> the foundation<S>3117</S> <S>3245</S> thereof even until now.
Send<S>7971</S> therefore now, and gather<S>5756</S> thy cattle<S>4735</S>, and all that thou hast in the field<S>7704</S>; for upon every man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S> which shall be found<S>4672</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, and shall not be brought<S>622</S> home<S>1004</S>, the hail<S>1259</S> shall come down<S>3381</S> upon them, and they shall die<S>4191</S>.
He that feared<S>3373</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> among the servants<S>5650</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> made his servants<S>5650</S> and his cattle<S>4735</S> flee<S>5127</S> into the houses<S>1004</S>:
And he that regarded<S>7760</S> <S>3820</S> not the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> left<S>5800</S> his servants<S>5650</S> and his cattle<S>4735</S> in the field<S>7704</S>. <sup>regarded: Heb. set not his heart unto</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Stretch forth<S>5186</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>, that there may be hail<S>1259</S> in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, upon man<S>120</S>, and upon beast<S>929</S>, and upon every herb<S>6212</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, throughout the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> stretched forth<S>5186</S> his rod<S>4294</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> sent<S>5414</S> thunder<S>6963</S> and hail<S>1259</S>, and the fire<S>784</S> ran along<S>1980</S> upon the ground<S>776</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> rained<S>4305</S> hail<S>1259</S> upon the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
So there was hail<S>1259</S>, and fire<S>784</S> <S>3947</S> mingled<S>8432</S> with the hail<S>1259</S>, very<S>3966</S> grievous<S>3515</S>, such as there was none<S>3808</S> like it in all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> since it became a nation<S>1471</S>.
And the hail<S>1259</S> smote<S>5221</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> all that was in the field<S>7704</S>, both man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S>; and the hail<S>1259</S> smote<S>5221</S> every herb<S>6212</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> every tree<S>6086</S> of the field<S>7704</S>.
Only in the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>, where the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were, was there no hail<S>1259</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> sent<S>7971</S>, and called<S>7121</S> for Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, I have sinned<S>2398</S> this time<S>6471</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> is righteous<S>6662</S>, and I and my people<S>5971</S> are wicked<S>7563</S>.
Intreat<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> (for it is enough<S>7227</S>) that there be no more mighty<S>430</S> thunderings<S>6963</S> and hail<S>1259</S>; and I will let you go<S>7971</S>, and ye shall stay<S>5975</S> no longer<S>3254</S>. <sup>mighty: Heb. voices of God</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, As soon as I am gone out<S>3318</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, I will spread abroad<S>6566</S> my hands<S>3709</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; and the thunder<S>6963</S> shall cease<S>2308</S>, neither shall there be any more hail<S>1259</S>; that thou mayest know<S>3045</S> how that the earth<S>776</S> is the LORD'S<S>3068</S>.
But as for thee and thy servants<S>5650</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that ye will not yet fear<S>3372</S> <S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S>.
And the flax<S>6594</S> and the barley<S>8184</S> was smitten<S>5221</S>: for the barley<S>8184</S> was in the ear<S>24</S>, and the flax<S>6594</S> was bolled<S>1392</S>.
But the wheat<S>2406</S> and the rie<S>3698</S> were not smitten<S>5221</S>: for they<S>2007</S> were not grown up<S>648</S>. <sup>not grown: Heb. hidden or, dark</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> went out<S>3318</S> of the city<S>5892</S> from Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and spread abroad<S>6566</S> his hands<S>3709</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: and the thunders<S>6963</S> and hail<S>1259</S> ceased<S>2308</S>, and the rain<S>4306</S> was not poured<S>5413</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>.
And when Pharaoh<S>6547</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the rain<S>4306</S> and the hail<S>1259</S> and the thunders<S>6963</S> were ceased<S>2308</S>, he sinned<S>2398</S> yet more<S>3254</S>, and hardened<S>3513</S> his heart<S>3820</S>, he and his servants<S>5650</S>.
And the heart<S>3820</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> was hardened<S>2388</S>, neither would he let the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> go<S>7971</S>; as the LORD<S>3068</S> had spoken<S>1696</S> by<S>3027</S> Moses<S>4872</S>. <sup>by Moses: Heb. by the hand of Moses</sup>

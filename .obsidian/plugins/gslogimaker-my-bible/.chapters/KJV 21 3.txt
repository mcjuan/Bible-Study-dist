To every thing there is a season<S>2165</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to every purpose<S>2656</S> under the heaven<S>8064</S>:
A time<S>6256</S> to be born<S>3205</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to die<S>4191</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to plant<S>5193</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to pluck up<S>6131</S> that which is planted<S>5193</S>; <sup>to be: Heb. to bear</sup>
A time<S>6256</S> to kill<S>2026</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to heal<S>7495</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to break down<S>6555</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to build up<S>1129</S>;
A time<S>6256</S> to weep<S>1058</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to laugh<S>7832</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to mourn<S>5594</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to dance<S>7540</S>;
A time<S>6256</S> to cast away<S>7993</S> stones<S>68</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to gather<S>3664</S> stones<S>68</S> together<S>3664</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to embrace<S>2263</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to refrain<S>7368</S> from embracing<S>2263</S>; <sup>to refrain from: Heb. to be far from</sup>
A time<S>6256</S> to get<S>1245</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to lose<S>6</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to keep<S>8104</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to cast away<S>7993</S>; <sup>get: or, seek</sup>
A time<S>6256</S> to rend<S>7167</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to sew<S>8609</S>; a time<S>6256</S> to keep silence<S>2814</S>, and a time<S>6256</S> to speak<S>1696</S>;

What profit<S>3504</S> hath he that worketh<S>6213</S> in that wherein<S>834</S> he laboureth<S>6001</S>?
I have seen<S>7200</S> the travail<S>6045</S>, which God<S>430</S> hath given<S>5414</S> to the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S> to be exercised<S>6031</S> in it.
He hath made<S>6213</S> every thing beautiful<S>3303</S> in his time<S>6256</S>: also he hath set<S>5414</S> the world<S>5769</S> in their heart<S>3820</S>, so that<S>1097</S> no man<S>120</S> can find out<S>4672</S> the work<S>4639</S> that God<S>430</S> maketh<S>6213</S> from the beginning<S>7218</S> to the end<S>5490</S>.
I know<S>3045</S> that there is no good<S>2896</S> in them, but for a man to rejoice<S>8055</S>, and to do<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S> in his life<S>2416</S>.
And also that every man<S>120</S> should eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>, and enjoy<S>7200</S> the good<S>2896</S> of all his labour<S>5999</S>, it is the gift<S>4991</S> of God<S>430</S>.
I know<S>3045</S> that, whatsoever God<S>430</S> doeth<S>6213</S>, it shall be for ever<S>5769</S>: nothing<S>369</S> can be put<S>3254</S> to it, nor any thing taken<S>1639</S> from it: and God<S>430</S> doeth<S>6213</S> it, that men should fear<S>3372</S> before<S>6440</S> him.
That which hath been is now<S>3528</S>; and that which is to be hath already<S>3528</S> been; and God<S>430</S> requireth<S>1245</S> that which is past<S>7291</S>. <sup>that which is past: Heb. that which is driven away</sup>
And moreover I saw<S>7200</S> under the sun<S>8121</S> the place<S>4725</S> of judgment<S>4941</S>, that wickedness<S>7562</S> was there; and the place<S>4725</S> of righteousness<S>6664</S>, that iniquity<S>7562</S> was there.
I said<S>559</S> in mine heart<S>3820</S>, God<S>430</S> shall judge<S>8199</S> the righteous<S>6662</S> and the wicked<S>7563</S>: for there is a time<S>6256</S> there for every purpose<S>2656</S> and for every work<S>4639</S>.
I said<S>559</S> in mine heart<S>3820</S> concerning the estate<S>1700</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, that God<S>430</S> might manifest<S>1305</S> them, and that they might see<S>7200</S> that they<S>1992</S> themselves are beasts<S>929</S>. <sup>that God: or, that they might clear God, and see, etc</sup>
For that which befalleth<S>4745</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S> befalleth<S>4745</S> beasts<S>929</S>; even one thing<S>259</S> befalleth<S>4745</S> them: as the one dieth<S>4194</S>, so dieth<S>4194</S> the other<S>2088</S>; yea, they have all one<S>259</S> breath<S>7307</S>; so that a man<S>120</S> hath no preeminence<S>4195</S> above a beast<S>929</S>: for all is vanity<S>1892</S>.
All go<S>1980</S> unto one<S>259</S> place<S>4725</S>; all are of the dust<S>6083</S>, and all turn<S>7725</S> to dust<S>6083</S> again<S>7725</S>.
Who knoweth<S>3045</S> the spirit<S>7307</S> of man<S>1121</S> <S>120</S> that goeth<S>5927</S> upward<S>4605</S>, and the spirit<S>7307</S> of the beast<S>929</S> that goeth<S>3381</S> downward<S>4295</S> to the earth<S>776</S>? <sup>of man: Heb. of the sons of man</sup> <sup>goeth upward: Heb. is ascending, etc</sup>
Wherefore I perceive<S>7200</S> that there is nothing better<S>2896</S>, than that a man<S>120</S> should rejoice<S>8055</S> in his own works<S>4639</S>; for that is his portion<S>2506</S>: for who shall bring<S>935</S> him to see<S>7200</S> what shall be after<S>310</S> him?

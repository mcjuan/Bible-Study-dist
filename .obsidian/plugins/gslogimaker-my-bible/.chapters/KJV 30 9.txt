I saw<S>7200</S> the Lord<S>136</S> standing<S>5324</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>: and he said<S>559</S>, Smite<S>5221</S> the lintel of the door<S>3730</S>, that the posts<S>5592</S> may shake<S>7493</S>: and cut<S>1214</S> them in the head<S>7218</S>, all of them; and I will slay<S>2026</S> the last<S>319</S> of them with the sword<S>2719</S>: he that fleeth<S>5127</S> of them shall not flee away<S>5127</S>, and he that escapeth<S>6412</S> of them shall not be delivered<S>4422</S>. <sup>lintel: or, chapiter, or, knop</sup> <sup>cut: or, wound them</sup>
Though they dig<S>2864</S> into hell<S>7585</S>, thence shall mine hand<S>3027</S> take<S>3947</S> them; though they climb up<S>5927</S> to heaven<S>8064</S>, thence will I bring them down<S>3381</S>:
And though they hide<S>2244</S> themselves in the top<S>7218</S> of Carmel<S>3760</S>, I will search<S>2664</S> and take them out<S>3947</S> thence; and though they be hid<S>5641</S> from my sight<S>5869</S> in the bottom<S>7172</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>, thence will I command<S>6680</S> the serpent<S>5175</S>, and he shall bite<S>5391</S> them:
And though they go<S>3212</S> into captivity<S>7628</S> before<S>6440</S> their enemies<S>341</S>, thence will I command<S>6680</S> the sword<S>2719</S>, and it shall slay<S>2026</S> them: and I will set<S>7760</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S> upon them for evil<S>7451</S>, and not for good<S>2896</S>.
And the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> is he that toucheth<S>5060</S> the land<S>776</S>, and it shall melt<S>4127</S>, and all that dwell<S>3427</S> therein shall mourn<S>56</S>: and it shall rise up<S>5927</S> wholly like a flood<S>2975</S>; and shall be drowned<S>8257</S>, as by the flood<S>2975</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
It is he that buildeth<S>1129</S> his stories<S>4609</S> in the heaven<S>8064</S>, and hath founded<S>3245</S> his troop<S>92</S> in the earth<S>776</S>; he that calleth<S>7121</S> for the waters<S>4325</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>, and poureth them out<S>8210</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: The LORD<S>3068</S> is his name<S>8034</S>. <sup>stories: or, spheres: Heb. ascensions</sup> <sup>troop: or, bundle</sup>
Are ye not as children<S>1121</S> of the Ethiopians<S>3569</S> unto me, O children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>? saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.

Behold, the eyes<S>5869</S> of the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> are upon the sinful<S>2403</S> kingdom<S>4467</S>, and I will destroy<S>8045</S> it from off the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>; saving<S>657</S> that I will not utterly<S>8045</S> destroy<S>8045</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
For, lo, I will command<S>6680</S>, and I will sift<S>5128</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> among all nations<S>1471</S>, like as corn is sifted<S>5128</S> in a sieve<S>3531</S>, yet shall not the least grain<S>6872</S> fall<S>5307</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>sift: Heb. cause to move</sup> <sup>grain: Heb. stone</sup>

In that day<S>3117</S> will I raise up<S>6965</S> the tabernacle<S>5521</S> of David<S>1732</S> that is fallen<S>5307</S>, and close up<S>1443</S> the breaches<S>6556</S> thereof; and I will raise up<S>6965</S> his ruins<S>2034</S>, and I will build<S>1129</S> it as in the days<S>3117</S> of old<S>5769</S>: <sup>close: Heb. hedge, or, wall</sup>

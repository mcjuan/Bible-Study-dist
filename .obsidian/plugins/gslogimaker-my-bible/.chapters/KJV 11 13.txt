And, behold, there came<S>935</S> a man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> out of Judah<S>3063</S> by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto Bethel<S>1008</S>: and Jeroboam<S>3379</S> stood<S>5975</S> by the altar<S>4196</S> to burn incense<S>6999</S>. <sup>burn: or, offer</sup>
And he cried<S>7121</S> against the altar<S>4196</S> in the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O altar<S>4196</S>, altar<S>4196</S>, thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Behold, a child<S>1121</S> shall be born<S>3205</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S>, Josiah<S>2977</S> by name<S>8034</S>; and upon thee shall he offer<S>2076</S> the priests<S>3548</S> of the high places<S>1116</S> that burn incense<S>6999</S> upon thee, and men's<S>120</S> bones<S>6106</S> shall be burnt<S>8313</S> upon thee.
And he gave<S>5414</S> a sign<S>4159</S> the same day<S>3117</S>, saying<S>559</S>, This is the sign<S>4159</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath spoken<S>1696</S>; Behold, the altar<S>4196</S> shall be rent<S>7167</S>, and the ashes<S>1880</S> that are upon it shall be poured out<S>8210</S>.
And it came to pass, when king<S>4428</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S> heard<S>8085</S> the saying<S>1697</S> of the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, which had cried<S>7121</S> against the altar<S>4196</S> in Bethel<S>1008</S>, that he put forth<S>7971</S> his hand<S>3027</S> from the altar<S>4196</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Lay hold<S>8610</S> on him. And his hand<S>3027</S>, which he put forth<S>7971</S> against him, dried up<S>3001</S>, so that he could<S>3201</S> not pull it in again<S>7725</S> to him.
The altar<S>4196</S> also was rent<S>7167</S>, and the ashes<S>1880</S> poured out<S>8210</S> from the altar<S>4196</S>, according to the sign<S>4159</S> which the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> had given<S>5414</S> by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, Intreat<S>2470</S> now the face<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, and pray<S>6419</S> for me, that my hand<S>3027</S> may be restored me again<S>7725</S>. And the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> besought<S>2470</S> <S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the king's<S>4428</S> hand<S>3027</S> was restored him again<S>7725</S>, and became as it was before<S>7223</S>. <sup>the LORD, and: Heb. the face of the LORD, etc</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>1696</S> unto the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, Come<S>935</S> home<S>1004</S> with me, and refresh<S>5582</S> thyself, and I will give<S>5414</S> thee a reward<S>4991</S>.
And the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, If thou wilt give<S>5414</S> me half<S>2677</S> thine house<S>1004</S>, I will not go in<S>935</S> with thee, neither will I eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S> in this place<S>4725</S>:
For so was it charged<S>6680</S> me by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Eat<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S>, nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>, nor turn again<S>7725</S> by the same way<S>1870</S> that thou camest<S>1980</S>.
So he went<S>3212</S> another<S>312</S> way<S>1870</S>, and returned<S>7725</S> not by the way<S>1870</S> that he came<S>935</S> to Bethel<S>1008</S>.
Now there dwelt<S>3427</S> an<S>259</S> old<S>2205</S> prophet<S>5030</S> in Bethel<S>1008</S>; and his sons<S>1121</S> came<S>935</S> and told<S>5608</S> him all the works<S>4639</S> that the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> had done<S>6213</S> that day<S>3117</S> in Bethel<S>1008</S>: the words<S>1697</S> which he had spoken<S>1696</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, them they told<S>5608</S> also to their father<S>1</S>.
And their father<S>1</S> said<S>1696</S> unto them, What way<S>1870</S> went<S>1980</S> he? For his sons<S>1121</S> had seen<S>7200</S> what<S>335</S> way<S>1870</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> went<S>1980</S>, which came<S>935</S> from Judah<S>3063</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his sons<S>1121</S>, Saddle<S>2280</S> me the ass<S>2543</S>. So they saddled<S>2280</S> him the ass<S>2543</S>: and he rode<S>7392</S> thereon,
And went<S>3212</S> after<S>310</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, and found<S>4672</S> him sitting<S>3427</S> under an oak<S>424</S>: and he said<S>559</S> unto him, Art thou the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> that camest<S>935</S> from Judah<S>3063</S>? And he said<S>559</S>, I am.
Then he said<S>559</S> unto him, Come<S>3212</S> home<S>1004</S> with me, and eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, I may<S>3201</S> not return<S>7725</S> with thee, nor go in<S>935</S> with thee: neither will I eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S> with thee in this place<S>4725</S>:
For it was said<S>1697</S> to me by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, Thou shalt eat<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S> nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S> there, nor turn again<S>7725</S> to go<S>3212</S> by the way<S>1870</S> that thou camest<S>1980</S>. <sup>it: Heb. a word was</sup>
He said<S>559</S> unto him, I am a prophet<S>5030</S> also as thou art; and an angel<S>4397</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto me by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Bring him back<S>7725</S> with thee into thine house<S>1004</S>, that he may eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> and drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>. But he lied<S>3584</S> unto him.
So he went back<S>7725</S> with him, and did eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> in his house<S>1004</S>, and drank<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>.
And it came to pass, as they sat<S>3427</S> at the table<S>7979</S>, that the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto the prophet<S>5030</S> that brought him back<S>7725</S>:
And he cried<S>7121</S> unto the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> that came<S>935</S> from Judah<S>3063</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Forasmuch as<S>3282</S> thou hast disobeyed<S>4784</S> the mouth<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and hast not kept<S>8104</S> the commandment<S>4687</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> commanded<S>6680</S> thee,
But camest back<S>7725</S>, and hast eaten<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> and drunk<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S> in the place<S>4725</S>, of the which the LORD did say<S>1696</S> to thee, Eat<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S>, and drink<S>8354</S> no water<S>4325</S>; thy carcase<S>5038</S> shall not come<S>935</S> unto the sepulchre<S>6913</S> of thy fathers<S>1</S>.
And it came to pass, after<S>310</S> he had eaten<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, and after<S>310</S> he had drunk<S>8354</S>, that he saddled<S>2280</S> for him the ass<S>2543</S>, to wit, for the prophet<S>5030</S> whom he had brought back<S>7725</S>.
And when he was gone<S>3212</S>, a lion<S>738</S> met<S>4672</S> him by the way<S>1870</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> him: and his carcase<S>5038</S> was cast<S>7993</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, and the ass<S>2543</S> stood<S>5975</S> by<S>681</S> it, the lion<S>738</S> also stood<S>5975</S> by the carcase<S>5038</S>.
And, behold, men<S>582</S> passed by<S>5674</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> the carcase<S>5038</S> cast<S>7993</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, and the lion<S>738</S> standing<S>5975</S> by<S>681</S> the carcase<S>5038</S>: and they came<S>935</S> and told<S>1696</S> it in the city<S>5892</S> where the old<S>2205</S> prophet<S>5030</S> dwelt<S>3427</S>.
And when the prophet<S>5030</S> that brought him back<S>7725</S> from the way<S>1870</S> heard<S>8085</S> thereof, he said<S>559</S>, It is the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, who was disobedient<S>4784</S> unto the word<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: therefore the LORD<S>3068</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> him unto the lion<S>738</S>, which hath torn<S>7665</S> him, and slain<S>4191</S> him, according to the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which he spake<S>1696</S> unto him. <sup>torn: Heb. broken</sup>
And he spake<S>1696</S> to his sons<S>1121</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Saddle<S>2280</S> me the ass<S>2543</S>. And they saddled<S>2280</S> him.
And he went<S>3212</S> and found<S>4672</S> his carcase<S>5038</S> cast<S>7993</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, and the ass<S>2543</S> and the lion<S>738</S> standing<S>5975</S> by<S>681</S> the carcase<S>5038</S>: the lion<S>738</S> had not eaten<S>398</S> the carcase<S>5038</S>, nor torn<S>7665</S> the ass<S>2543</S>. <sup>torn: Heb. broken</sup>
And the prophet<S>5030</S> took up<S>5375</S> the carcase<S>5038</S> of the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, and laid<S>3240</S> it upon the ass<S>2543</S>, and brought it back<S>7725</S>: and the old<S>2205</S> prophet<S>5030</S> came<S>935</S> to the city<S>5892</S>, to mourn<S>5594</S> and to bury<S>6912</S> him.
And he laid<S>3240</S> his carcase<S>5038</S> in his own grave<S>6913</S>; and they mourned<S>5594</S> over him, saying, Alas<S>1945</S>, my brother<S>251</S>!
And it came to pass, after<S>310</S> he had buried<S>6912</S> him, that he spake<S>559</S> to his sons<S>1121</S>, saying<S>559</S>, When I am dead<S>4191</S>, then bury<S>6912</S> me in the sepulchre<S>6913</S> wherein the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> is buried<S>6912</S>; lay<S>3240</S> my bones<S>6106</S> beside<S>681</S> his bones<S>6106</S>:
For the saying<S>1697</S> which he cried<S>7121</S> by the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> against the altar<S>4196</S> in Bethel<S>1008</S>, and against all the houses<S>1004</S> of the high places<S>1116</S> which are in the cities<S>5892</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>, shall surely come to pass.
After<S>310</S> this thing<S>1697</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S> returned<S>7725</S> not from his evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>, but made<S>6213</S> again<S>7725</S> of the lowest<S>7098</S> of the people<S>5971</S> priests<S>3548</S> of the high places<S>1116</S>: whosoever would<S>2655</S>, he consecrated<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> him, and he became one of the priests<S>3548</S> of the high places<S>1116</S>. <sup>made: Heb. returned and made</sup> <sup>consecrated: Heb. filled his hand</sup>
And this thing<S>1697</S> became sin<S>2403</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S>, even to cut it off<S>3582</S>, and to destroy<S>8045</S> it from off the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>.

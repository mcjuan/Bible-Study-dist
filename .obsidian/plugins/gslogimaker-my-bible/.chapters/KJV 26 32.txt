And it came to pass in the twelfth<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S>, in the twelfth month<S>2320</S>, in the first<S>259</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, that the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, take up<S>5375</S> a lamentation<S>7015</S> for Pharaoh<S>6547</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto him, Thou art like<S>1819</S> a young lion<S>3715</S> of the nations<S>1471</S>, and thou art as a whale<S>8577</S> <S>8565</S> in the seas<S>3220</S>: and thou camest forth<S>1518</S> with thy rivers<S>5104</S>, and troubledst<S>1804</S> the waters<S>4325</S> with thy feet<S>7272</S>, and fouledst<S>7515</S> their rivers<S>5104</S>. <sup>whale: or, dragon</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; I will therefore spread out<S>6566</S> my net<S>7568</S> over thee with a company<S>6951</S> of many<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>; and they shall bring thee up<S>5927</S> in my net<S>2764</S>.
Then will I leave<S>5203</S> thee upon the land<S>776</S>, I will cast thee forth<S>2904</S> upon the open<S>6440</S> field<S>7704</S>, and will cause all the fowls<S>5775</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S> to remain<S>7931</S> upon thee, and I will fill<S>7646</S> the beasts<S>2416</S> of the whole earth<S>776</S> with thee.
And I will lay<S>5414</S> thy flesh<S>1320</S> upon the mountains<S>2022</S>, and fill<S>4390</S> the valleys<S>1516</S> with thy height<S>7419</S>.
I will also water<S>8248</S> with thy blood<S>1818</S> the land<S>776</S> wherein thou swimmest<S>6824</S>, even to the mountains<S>2022</S>; and the rivers<S>650</S> shall be full<S>4390</S> of thee. <sup>the land wherein: or, the land of thy swimming</sup>
And when I shall put thee out<S>3518</S>, I will cover<S>3680</S> the heaven<S>8064</S>, and make<S>6937</S> the stars<S>3556</S> thereof dark<S>6937</S>; I will cover<S>3680</S> the sun<S>8121</S> with a cloud<S>6051</S>, and the moon<S>3394</S> shall not give<S>215</S> her light<S>216</S>. <sup>put: or, extinguish thee</sup>
All the bright<S>3974</S> lights<S>216</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> will I make dark<S>6937</S> over thee, and set<S>5414</S> darkness<S>2822</S> upon thy land<S>776</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>. <sup>bright: Heb. lights of the light in heaven</sup> <sup>dark: Heb. them dark</sup>
I will also vex<S>3707</S> the hearts<S>3820</S> of many<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>, when I shall bring<S>935</S> thy destruction<S>7667</S> among the nations<S>1471</S>, into the countries<S>776</S> which thou hast not known<S>3045</S>. <sup>vex: Heb. provoke to anger, or, grief</sup>
Yea, I will make many<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S> amazed<S>8074</S> at thee, and their kings<S>4428</S> shall be horribly<S>8178</S> afraid<S>8175</S> for thee, when I shall brandish<S>5774</S> my sword<S>2719</S> before them<S>6440</S>; and they shall tremble<S>2729</S> at every moment<S>7281</S>, every man<S>376</S> for his own life<S>5315</S>, in the day<S>3117</S> of thy fall<S>4658</S>.
For thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; The sword<S>2719</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> shall come<S>935</S> upon thee.
By the swords<S>2719</S> of the mighty<S>1368</S> will I cause thy multitude<S>1995</S> to fall<S>5307</S>, the terrible<S>6184</S> of the nations<S>1471</S>, all of them: and they shall spoil<S>7703</S> the pomp<S>1347</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and all the multitude<S>1995</S> thereof shall be destroyed<S>8045</S>.
I will destroy<S>6</S> also all the beasts<S>929</S> thereof from<S>5921</S> beside the great<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S>; neither shall the foot<S>7272</S> of man<S>120</S> trouble<S>1804</S> them any more, nor the hoofs<S>6541</S> of beasts<S>929</S> trouble<S>1804</S> them.
Then will I make their waters<S>4325</S> deep<S>8257</S>, and cause their rivers<S>5104</S> to run<S>3212</S> like oil<S>8081</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>.
When I shall make<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> desolate<S>8077</S>, and the country<S>776</S> shall be destitute<S>8074</S> of that whereof it was full<S>4393</S>, when I shall smite<S>5221</S> all them that dwell<S>3427</S> therein, then shall they know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>destitute: Heb. desolate from the fulness thereof</sup>
This is the lamentation<S>7015</S> wherewith they shall lament<S>6969</S> her: the daughters<S>1323</S> of the nations<S>1471</S> shall lament<S>6969</S> her: they shall lament<S>6969</S> for her, even for Egypt<S>4714</S>, and for all her multitude<S>1995</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>.

And the LORD<S>3068</S> sent<S>7971</S> Nathan<S>5416</S> unto David<S>1732</S>. And he came<S>935</S> unto him, and said<S>559</S> unto him, There were two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> in one<S>259</S> city<S>5892</S>; the one<S>259</S> rich<S>6223</S>, and the other<S>259</S> poor<S>7326</S>.
The rich<S>6223</S> man had exceeding<S>3966</S> many<S>7235</S> flocks<S>6629</S> and herds<S>1241</S>:
But the poor<S>7326</S> man had nothing, save one<S>259</S> little<S>6996</S> ewe lamb<S>3535</S>, which he had bought<S>7069</S> and nourished up<S>2421</S>: and it grew up<S>1431</S> together<S>3162</S> with him, and with his children<S>1121</S>; it did eat<S>398</S> of his own meat<S>6595</S>, and drank<S>8354</S> of his own cup<S>3563</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> in his bosom<S>2436</S>, and was unto him as a daughter<S>1323</S>. <sup>meat: Heb. morsel</sup>
And there came<S>935</S> a traveller<S>1982</S> unto the rich<S>6223</S> man<S>376</S>, and he spared<S>2550</S> to take<S>3947</S> of his own flock<S>6629</S> and of his own herd<S>1241</S>, to dress<S>6213</S> for the wayfaring man<S>732</S> that was come<S>935</S> unto him; but took<S>3947</S> the poor<S>7326</S> man's<S>376</S> lamb<S>3535</S>, and dressed<S>6213</S> it for the man<S>376</S> that was come<S>935</S> to him.
And David's<S>1732</S> anger<S>639</S> was greatly<S>3966</S> kindled<S>2734</S> against the man<S>376</S>; and he said<S>559</S> to Nathan<S>5416</S>, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, the man<S>376</S> that hath done<S>6213</S> this thing shall surely<S>1121</S> die<S>4194</S>: <sup>shall: or, is worthy to die, or, is a son of death</sup>
And he shall restore<S>7999</S> the lamb<S>3535</S> fourfold<S>706</S>, because<S>6118</S> he did<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S>, and because<S>834</S> he had no pity<S>2550</S>.
And Nathan<S>5416</S> said<S>559</S> to David<S>1732</S>, Thou art the man<S>376</S>. Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, I anointed<S>4886</S> thee king<S>4428</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>, and I delivered<S>5337</S> thee out of the hand<S>3027</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>;
And I gave<S>5414</S> thee thy master's<S>113</S> house<S>1004</S>, and thy master's<S>113</S> wives<S>802</S> into thy bosom<S>2436</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> thee the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and of Judah<S>3063</S>; and if that had been too little<S>4592</S>, I would moreover have given<S>3254</S> unto thee such<S>2007</S> and such things<S>2007</S>.
Wherefore hast thou despised<S>959</S> the commandment<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to do<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in his sight<S>5869</S>? thou hast killed<S>5221</S> Uriah<S>223</S> the Hittite<S>2850</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>, and hast taken<S>3947</S> his wife<S>802</S> to be thy wife<S>802</S>, and hast slain<S>2026</S> him with the sword<S>2719</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>.
Now therefore the sword<S>2719</S> shall never<S>5704</S> <S>5769</S> depart<S>5493</S> from thine house<S>1004</S>; because<S>6118</S> thou hast despised<S>959</S> me, and hast taken<S>3947</S> the wife<S>802</S> of Uriah<S>223</S> the Hittite<S>2850</S> to be thy wife<S>802</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, Behold, I will raise up<S>6965</S> evil<S>7451</S> against thee out of thine own house<S>1004</S>, and I will take<S>3947</S> thy wives<S>802</S> before thine eyes<S>5869</S>, and give<S>5414</S> them unto thy neighbour<S>7453</S>, and he shall lie<S>7901</S> with thy wives<S>802</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of this sun<S>8121</S>.
For thou didst<S>6213</S> it secretly<S>5643</S>: but I will do<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S> before all Israel<S>3478</S>, and before the sun<S>8121</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto Nathan<S>5416</S>, I have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>. And Nathan<S>5416</S> said<S>559</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> also hath put away<S>5674</S> thy sin<S>2403</S>; thou shalt not die<S>4191</S>.
Howbeit<S>657</S>, because by this deed<S>1697</S> thou hast given<S>5006</S> great occasion<S>5006</S> to the enemies<S>341</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> to blaspheme<S>5006</S>, the child<S>1121</S> also that is born<S>3209</S> unto thee shall surely<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S>.
And Nathan<S>5416</S> departed<S>3212</S> unto his house<S>1004</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> struck<S>5062</S> the child<S>3206</S> that Uriah's<S>223</S> wife<S>802</S> bare<S>3205</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, and it was very sick<S>605</S>.
David<S>1732</S> therefore besought<S>1245</S> God<S>430</S> for the child<S>5288</S>; and David<S>1732</S> fasted<S>6684</S> <S>6685</S>, and went in<S>935</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> all night<S>3885</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>fasted: Heb. fasted a fast</sup>
And the elders<S>2205</S> of his house<S>1004</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went to him, to raise him up<S>6965</S> from the earth<S>776</S>: but he would<S>14</S> not, neither did he eat<S>1262</S> bread<S>3899</S> with them.
And it came to pass on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, that the child<S>3206</S> died<S>4191</S>. And the servants<S>5650</S> of David<S>1732</S> feared<S>3372</S> to tell<S>5046</S> him that the child<S>3206</S> was dead<S>4191</S>: for they said<S>559</S>, Behold, while the child<S>3206</S> was yet alive<S>2416</S>, we spake<S>1696</S> unto him, and he would not hearken<S>8085</S> unto our voice<S>6963</S>: how will he then<S>6213</S> vex<S>7451</S> himself<S>6213</S>, if we tell<S>559</S> him that the child<S>3206</S> is dead<S>4191</S>? <sup>vex: Heb. do hurt</sup>
But when David<S>1732</S> saw<S>7200</S> that his servants<S>5650</S> whispered<S>3907</S>, David<S>1732</S> perceived<S>995</S> that the child<S>3206</S> was dead<S>4191</S>: therefore David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto his servants<S>5650</S>, Is the child<S>3206</S> dead<S>4191</S>? And they said<S>559</S>, He is dead<S>4191</S>.
Then David<S>1732</S> arose<S>6965</S> from the earth<S>776</S>, and washed<S>7364</S>, and anointed<S>5480</S> himself, and changed<S>2498</S> his apparel<S>8071</S>, and came<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and worshipped<S>7812</S>: then he came<S>935</S> to his own house<S>1004</S>; and when he required<S>7592</S>, they set<S>7760</S> bread<S>3899</S> before him, and he did eat<S>398</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> his servants<S>5650</S> unto him, What thing<S>1697</S> is this that thou hast done<S>6213</S>? thou didst fast<S>6684</S> and weep<S>1058</S> for the child<S>3206</S>, while it was alive<S>2416</S>; but when the child<S>3206</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, thou didst rise<S>6965</S> and eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, While the child<S>3206</S> was yet alive<S>2416</S>, I fasted<S>6684</S> and wept<S>1058</S>: for I said<S>559</S>, Who can tell<S>3045</S> whether GOD<S>3068</S> will be gracious<S>2603</S> <S>2603</S> to me, that the child<S>3206</S> may live<S>2416</S>?
But now he is dead<S>4191</S>, wherefore should I fast<S>6684</S>? can<S>3201</S> I bring him back again<S>7725</S>? I shall go<S>1980</S> to him, but he shall not return<S>7725</S> to me.
And David<S>1732</S> comforted<S>5162</S> Bathsheba<S>1339</S> his wife<S>802</S>, and went in<S>935</S> unto her, and lay<S>7901</S> with her: and she bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and he called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Solomon<S>8010</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> loved<S>157</S> him.
And he sent<S>7971</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Nathan<S>5416</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>; and he called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Jedidiah<S>3041</S>, because of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>Jedidiah: that is, Beloved of the LORD</sup>
And Joab<S>3097</S> fought<S>3898</S> against Rabbah<S>7237</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and took<S>3920</S> the royal<S>4410</S> city<S>5892</S>.
And Joab<S>3097</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to David<S>1732</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I have fought<S>3898</S> against Rabbah<S>7237</S>, and have taken<S>3920</S> the city<S>5892</S> of waters<S>4325</S>.
Now therefore gather<S>622</S> the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S> together<S>622</S>, and encamp<S>2583</S> against the city<S>5892</S>, and take<S>3920</S> it: lest I take<S>3920</S> the city<S>5892</S>, and it be called<S>7121</S> after my name<S>8034</S>. <sup>it be called: Heb. my name be called upon it</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> gathered<S>622</S> all the people<S>5971</S> together<S>622</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to Rabbah<S>7237</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> against it, and took<S>3920</S> it.
And he took<S>3947</S> their king's<S>4428</S> crown<S>5850</S> from off his head<S>7218</S>, the weight<S>4948</S> whereof was a talent<S>3603</S> of gold<S>2091</S> with the precious<S>3368</S> stones<S>68</S>: and it was set on David's<S>1732</S> head<S>7218</S>. And he brought forth<S>3318</S> the spoil<S>7998</S> of the city<S>5892</S> in great<S>3966</S> abundance<S>7235</S>. <sup>in great: Heb. very great</sup>
And he brought forth<S>3318</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were therein, and put<S>7760</S> them under saws<S>4050</S>, and under harrows<S>2757</S> of iron<S>1270</S>, and under axes<S>4037</S> of iron<S>1270</S>, and made them pass<S>5674</S> through the brickkiln<S>4404</S>: and thus did<S>6213</S> he unto all the cities<S>5892</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>. So David<S>1732</S> and all the people<S>5971</S> returned<S>7725</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.

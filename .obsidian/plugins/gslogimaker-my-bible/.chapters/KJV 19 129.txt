A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S>. Many a time<S>7227</S> have they afflicted<S>6887</S> me from my youth<S>5271</S>, may Israel<S>3478</S> now say<S>559</S>: <sup>Many: or, Much</sup>
Many a time<S>7227</S> have they afflicted<S>6887</S> me from my youth<S>5271</S>: yet they have not prevailed<S>3201</S> against me. <sup>Many: or, Much</sup>
The plowers<S>2790</S> plowed<S>2790</S> upon my back<S>1354</S>: they made long<S>748</S> their furrows<S>4618</S> <S>4618</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is righteous<S>6662</S>: he hath cut asunder<S>7112</S> the cords<S>5688</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>.
Let them all be confounded<S>954</S> and turned<S>5472</S> back<S>268</S> that hate<S>8130</S> Zion<S>6726</S>.
Let them be as the grass<S>2682</S> upon the housetops<S>1406</S>, which withereth<S>3001</S> afore<S>6927</S> it groweth up<S>8025</S>:
Wherewith the mower<S>7114</S> filleth<S>4390</S> not his hand<S>3709</S>; nor he that bindeth sheaves<S>6014</S> his bosom<S>2683</S>.
Neither do they which go by<S>5674</S> say<S>559</S>, The blessing<S>1293</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> be upon you: we bless<S>1288</S> you in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.

He that dwelleth<S>3427</S> in the secret<S>5643</S> place of the most High<S>5945</S> shall abide<S>3885</S> under the shadow<S>6738</S> of the Almighty<S>7706</S>. <sup>abide: Heb. lodge</sup>
I will say<S>559</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, He is my refuge<S>4268</S> and my fortress<S>4686</S>: my God<S>430</S>; in him will I trust<S>982</S>.
Surely he shall deliver<S>5337</S> thee from the snare<S>6341</S> of the fowler<S>3353</S>, and from the noisome<S>1942</S> pestilence<S>1698</S>.
He shall cover<S>5526</S> thee with his feathers<S>84</S>, and under his wings<S>3671</S> shalt thou trust<S>2620</S>: his truth<S>571</S> shall be thy shield<S>6793</S> and buckler<S>5507</S>.
Thou shalt not be afraid<S>3372</S> for the terror<S>6343</S> by night<S>3915</S>; nor for the arrow<S>2671</S> that flieth<S>5774</S> by day<S>3119</S>;
Nor for the pestilence<S>1698</S> that walketh<S>1980</S> in darkness<S>652</S>; nor for the destruction<S>6986</S> that wasteth<S>7736</S> at noonday<S>6672</S>.
A thousand<S>505</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> at thy side<S>6654</S>, and ten thousand<S>7233</S> at thy right hand<S>3225</S>; but it shall not come nigh<S>5066</S> thee.
Only with thine eyes<S>5869</S> shalt thou behold<S>5027</S> and see<S>7200</S> the reward<S>8011</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>.
Because thou hast made<S>7760</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, which is my refuge<S>4268</S>, even the most High<S>5945</S>, thy habitation<S>4583</S>;
There shall no evil<S>7451</S> befall<S>579</S> thee, neither shall any plague<S>5061</S> come nigh<S>7126</S> thy dwelling<S>168</S>.
For he shall give his angels<S>4397</S> charge<S>6680</S> over thee, to keep<S>8104</S> thee in all thy ways<S>1870</S>.
They shall bear thee up<S>5375</S> in their hands<S>3709</S>, lest thou dash<S>5062</S> thy foot<S>7272</S> against a stone<S>68</S>.
Thou shalt tread<S>1869</S> upon the lion<S>7826</S> and adder<S>6620</S>: the young lion<S>3715</S> and the dragon<S>8577</S> shalt thou trample under feet<S>7429</S>. <sup>adder: or, asp</sup>
Because he hath set his love<S>2836</S> upon me, therefore will I deliver<S>6403</S> him: I will set him on high<S>7682</S>, because he hath known<S>3045</S> my name<S>8034</S>.
He shall call<S>7121</S> upon me, and I will answer<S>6030</S> him: I will be with him in trouble<S>6869</S>; I will deliver<S>2502</S> him, and honour<S>3513</S> him.
With long<S>753</S> life<S>3117</S> will I satisfy<S>7646</S> him, and shew<S>7200</S> him my salvation<S>3444</S>. <sup>long: Heb. length of days</sup>

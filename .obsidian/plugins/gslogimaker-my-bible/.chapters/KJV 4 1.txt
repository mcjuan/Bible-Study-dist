Only thou shalt not number<S>6485</S> the tribe<S>4294</S> of Levi<S>3878</S>, neither take<S>5375</S> the sum<S>7218</S> of them among<S>8432</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:
But thou shalt appoint<S>6485</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> over the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of testimony<S>5715</S>, and over all the vessels<S>3627</S> thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear<S>5375</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S>, and all the vessels<S>3627</S> thereof; and they shall minister<S>8334</S> unto it, and shall encamp<S>2583</S> round about<S>5439</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S>.
And when the tabernacle<S>4908</S> setteth forward<S>5265</S>, the Levites<S>3881</S> shall take it down<S>3381</S>: and when the tabernacle<S>4908</S> is to be pitched<S>2583</S>, the Levites<S>3881</S> shall set it up<S>6965</S>: and the stranger<S>2114</S> that cometh nigh<S>7131</S> shall be put to death<S>4191</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall pitch their tents<S>2583</S>, every man<S>376</S> by his own camp<S>4264</S>, and every man<S>376</S> by his own standard<S>1714</S>, throughout their hosts<S>6635</S>.
But the Levites<S>3881</S> shall pitch<S>2583</S> round about<S>5439</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of testimony<S>5715</S>, that there be no wrath<S>7110</S> upon the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and the Levites<S>3881</S> shall keep<S>8104</S> the charge<S>4931</S> of the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of testimony<S>5715</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> according to all that the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, so did<S>6213</S> they.

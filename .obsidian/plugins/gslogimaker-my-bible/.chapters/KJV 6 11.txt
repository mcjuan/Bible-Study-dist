And it came to pass, when Jabin<S>2985</S> king<S>4428</S> of Hazor<S>2674</S> had heard<S>8085</S> those things, that he sent<S>7971</S> to Jobab<S>3103</S> king<S>4428</S> of Madon<S>4068</S>, and to the king<S>4428</S> of Shimron<S>8110</S>, and to the king<S>4428</S> of Achshaph<S>407</S>,
And to the kings<S>4428</S> that were on the north<S>6828</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>, and of the plains<S>6160</S> south<S>5045</S> of Chinneroth<S>3672</S>, and in the valley<S>8219</S>, and in the borders<S>5299</S> of Dor<S>1756</S> on the west<S>3220</S>,
And to the Canaanite<S>3669</S> on the east<S>4217</S> and on the west<S>3220</S>, and to the Amorite<S>567</S>, and the Hittite<S>2850</S>, and the Perizzite<S>6522</S>, and the Jebusite<S>2983</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S>, and to the Hivite<S>2340</S> under Hermon<S>2768</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Mizpeh<S>4709</S>.
And they went out<S>3318</S>, they and all their hosts<S>4264</S> with them, much<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>, even as the sand<S>2344</S> that is upon the sea<S>3220</S> shore<S>8193</S> in multitude<S>7230</S>, with horses<S>5483</S> and chariots<S>7393</S> very<S>3966</S> many<S>7227</S>.
And when all these kings<S>4428</S> were met together<S>3259</S>, they came<S>935</S> and pitched<S>2583</S> together<S>3162</S> at the waters<S>4325</S> of Merom<S>4792</S>, to fight<S>3898</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>met: Heb. assembled by appointment</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Be not afraid<S>3372</S> because<S>6440</S> of them: for to morrow<S>4279</S> about this time<S>6256</S> will I deliver them up<S>5414</S> all slain<S>2491</S> before<S>6440</S> Israel<S>3478</S>: thou shalt hough<S>6131</S> their horses<S>5483</S>, and burn<S>8313</S> their chariots<S>4818</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
So Joshua<S>3091</S> came<S>935</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> of war<S>4421</S> with him, against them by the waters<S>4325</S> of Merom<S>4792</S> suddenly<S>6597</S>; and they fell upon<S>5307</S> them.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> delivered<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, who smote<S>5221</S> them, and chased<S>7291</S> them unto great<S>7227</S> Zidon<S>6721</S>, and unto Misrephothmaim<S>4956</S>, and unto the valley<S>1237</S> of Mizpeh<S>4708</S> eastward<S>4217</S>; and they smote<S>5221</S> them, until they left<S>7604</S> them none remaining<S>8300</S>. <sup>great Zidon: or, Zidonrabbah</sup> <sup>Misrephothmaim: or, Salt pits: Heb. Burnings of waters</sup>
And Joshua<S>3091</S> did<S>6213</S> unto them as the LORD<S>3068</S> bade<S>559</S> him: he houghed<S>6131</S> their horses<S>5483</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> their chariots<S>4818</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> at that time<S>6256</S> turned back<S>7725</S>, and took<S>3920</S> Hazor<S>2674</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> the king<S>4428</S> thereof with the sword<S>2719</S>: for Hazor<S>2674</S> beforetime<S>6440</S> was the head<S>7218</S> of all those kingdoms<S>4467</S>.
And they smote<S>5221</S> all the souls<S>5315</S> that were therein with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, utterly destroying<S>2763</S> them: there was not any left<S>3498</S> to breathe<S>5397</S>: and he burnt<S>8313</S> Hazor<S>2674</S> with fire<S>784</S>. <sup>any: Heb. any breath</sup>
And all the cities<S>5892</S> of those kings<S>4428</S>, and all the kings<S>4428</S> of them, did Joshua<S>3091</S> take<S>3920</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> them with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, and he utterly destroyed<S>2763</S> them, as Moses<S>4872</S> the servant<S>5650</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>.
But as for the cities<S>5892</S> that stood<S>5975</S> still in their strength<S>8510</S>, Israel<S>3478</S> burned<S>8313</S> none of them, save<S>2108</S> Hazor<S>2674</S> only; that did Joshua<S>3091</S> burn<S>8313</S>. <sup>in their: Heb. on their heap</sup>
And all the spoil<S>7998</S> of these cities<S>5892</S>, and the cattle<S>929</S>, the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> took for a prey<S>962</S> unto themselves; but every man<S>120</S> they smote<S>5221</S> with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, until they had destroyed<S>8045</S> them, neither left<S>7604</S> they any to breathe<S>5397</S>.
As the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S> his servant<S>5650</S>, so did Moses<S>4872</S> command<S>6680</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>, and so did<S>6213</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>; he left<S>5493</S> nothing<S>1697</S> undone<S>5493</S> of all that the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>. <sup>left: Heb. removed nothing</sup>
So Joshua<S>3091</S> took<S>3947</S> all that land<S>776</S>, the hills<S>2022</S>, and all the south country<S>5045</S>, and all the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>, and the valley<S>8219</S>, and the plain<S>6160</S>, and the mountain<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and the valley<S>8219</S> of the same;
Even from the mount<S>2022</S> Halak<S>2510</S>, that goeth up<S>5927</S> to Seir<S>8165</S>, even unto Baalgad<S>1171</S> in the valley<S>1237</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S> under mount<S>2022</S> Hermon<S>2768</S>: and all their kings<S>4428</S> he took<S>3920</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> them, and slew<S>4191</S> them. <sup>the mount: or, the smooth mountain</sup>
Joshua<S>3091</S> made<S>6213</S> war<S>4421</S> a long<S>7227</S> time<S>3117</S> with all those kings<S>4428</S>.
There was not a city<S>5892</S> that made peace<S>7999</S> with the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, save the Hivites<S>2340</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Gibeon<S>1391</S>: all other they took<S>3947</S> in battle<S>4421</S>.
For it was of the LORD<S>3068</S> to harden<S>2388</S> their hearts<S>3820</S>, that they should come against<S>7125</S> Israel<S>3478</S> in battle<S>4421</S>, that he might destroy them utterly<S>2763</S>, and that they might have no favour<S>8467</S>, but that he might destroy<S>8045</S> them, as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And at that time<S>6256</S> came<S>935</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>, and cut off<S>3772</S> the Anakims<S>6062</S> from the mountains<S>2022</S>, from Hebron<S>2275</S>, from Debir<S>1688</S>, from Anab<S>6024</S>, and from all the mountains<S>2022</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and from all the mountains<S>2022</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: Joshua<S>3091</S> destroyed them utterly<S>2763</S> with their cities<S>5892</S>.
There was none of the Anakims<S>6062</S> left<S>3498</S> in the land<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: only in Gaza<S>5804</S>, in Gath<S>1661</S>, and in Ashdod<S>795</S>, there remained<S>7604</S>.
So Joshua<S>3091</S> took<S>3947</S> the whole land<S>776</S>, according to all that the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>; and Joshua<S>3091</S> gave<S>5414</S> it for an inheritance<S>5159</S> unto Israel<S>3478</S> according to their divisions<S>4256</S> by their tribes<S>7626</S>. And the land<S>776</S> rested<S>8252</S> from war<S>4421</S>.

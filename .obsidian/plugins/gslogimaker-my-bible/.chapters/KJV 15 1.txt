Now in the first<S>259</S> year<S>8141</S> of Cyrus<S>3566</S> king<S>4428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S>, that the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> by the mouth<S>6310</S> of Jeremiah<S>3414</S> might be fulfilled<S>3615</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> stirred up<S>5782</S> the spirit<S>7307</S> of Cyrus<S>3566</S> king<S>4428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S>, that he made a proclamation<S>5674</S> <S>6963</S> throughout all his kingdom<S>4438</S>, and put it also in writing<S>4385</S>, saying<S>559</S>, <sup>made: Heb. caused a voice to pass</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> Cyrus<S>3566</S> king<S>4428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> hath given<S>5414</S> me all the kingdoms<S>4467</S> of the earth<S>776</S>; and he hath charged<S>6485</S> me to build<S>1129</S> him an house<S>1004</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, which is in Judah<S>3063</S>.
Who is there among you of all his people<S>5971</S>? his God<S>430</S> be with him, and let him go up<S>5927</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, which is in Judah<S>3063</S>, and build<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, (he is the God<S>430</S>,) which is in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And whosoever remaineth<S>7604</S> in any place<S>4725</S> where he sojourneth<S>1481</S>, let the men<S>582</S> of his place<S>4725</S> help<S>5375</S> him with silver<S>3701</S>, and with gold<S>2091</S>, and with goods<S>7399</S>, and with beasts<S>929</S>, beside the freewill offering<S>5071</S> for the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> that is in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>help: Heb. lift him up</sup>
Then rose up<S>6965</S> the chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S>, and the Levites<S>3881</S>, with all them whose spirit<S>7307</S> God<S>430</S> had raised<S>5782</S>, to go up<S>5927</S> to build<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> which is in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And all they that were about<S>5439</S> them strengthened<S>2388</S> their hands<S>3027</S> with vessels<S>3627</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, with gold<S>2091</S>, with goods<S>7399</S>, and with beasts<S>929</S>, and with precious things<S>4030</S>, beside all that was willingly offered<S>5068</S>. <sup>strengthened: that is, helped them</sup>
Also Cyrus<S>3566</S> the king<S>4428</S> brought forth<S>3318</S> the vessels<S>3627</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> had brought forth<S>3318</S> out of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and had put<S>5414</S> them in the house<S>1004</S> of his gods<S>430</S>;
Even those did Cyrus<S>3566</S> king<S>4428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S> bring forth<S>3318</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Mithredath<S>4990</S> the treasurer<S>1489</S>, and numbered<S>5608</S> them unto Sheshbazzar<S>8339</S>, the prince<S>5387</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
And this is the number<S>4557</S> of them: thirty<S>7970</S> chargers<S>105</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, a thousand<S>505</S> chargers<S>105</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, nine<S>8672</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> knives<S>4252</S>,
Thirty<S>7970</S> basons<S>3713</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, silver<S>3701</S> basons<S>3713</S> of a second<S>4932</S> sort four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> and ten<S>6235</S>, and other<S>312</S> vessels<S>3627</S> a thousand<S>505</S>.
All the vessels<S>3627</S> of gold<S>2091</S> and of silver<S>3701</S> were five<S>2568</S> thousand<S>505</S> and four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S>. All these did Sheshbazzar<S>8339</S> bring up<S>5927</S> with them of the captivity<S>1473</S> that were brought up<S>5927</S> from Babylon<S>894</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>the captivity: Heb. the transportation</sup>

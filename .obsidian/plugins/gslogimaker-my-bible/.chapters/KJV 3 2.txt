And when any<S>5315</S> will offer<S>7126</S> a meat<S>4503</S> offering<S>7133</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, his offering<S>7133</S> shall be of fine flour<S>5560</S>; and he shall pour<S>3332</S> oil<S>8081</S> upon it, and put<S>5414</S> frankincense<S>3828</S> thereon:
And he shall bring<S>935</S> it to Aaron's<S>175</S> sons<S>1121</S> the priests<S>3548</S>: and he shall take<S>7061</S> thereout<S>8033</S> his handful<S>7062</S> <S>4393</S> of the flour<S>5560</S> thereof, and of the oil<S>8081</S> thereof, with all the frankincense<S>3828</S> thereof; and the priest<S>3548</S> shall burn<S>6999</S> the memorial<S>234</S> of it upon the altar<S>4196</S>, to be an offering made by fire<S>801</S>, of a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>:
And the remnant<S>3498</S> of the meat offering<S>4503</S> shall be Aaron's<S>175</S> and his sons'<S>1121</S>: it is a thing most<S>6944</S> holy<S>6944</S> of the offerings<S>801</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> made by fire<S>801</S>.
And if thou bring<S>7126</S> an oblation<S>7133</S> of a meat offering<S>4503</S> baken<S>3989</S> in the oven<S>8574</S>, it shall be unleavened<S>4682</S> cakes<S>2471</S> of fine flour<S>5560</S> mingled<S>1101</S> with oil<S>8081</S>, or unleavened<S>4682</S> wafers<S>7550</S> anointed<S>4886</S> with oil<S>8081</S>.
And if thy oblation<S>7133</S> be a meat offering<S>4503</S> baken in a pan<S>4227</S>, it shall be of fine flour<S>5560</S> unleavened<S>4682</S>, mingled<S>1101</S> with oil<S>8081</S>. <sup>in a pan: or, on a flat plate, or, slice</sup>
Thou shalt part<S>6626</S> it in pieces<S>6595</S>, and pour<S>3332</S> oil<S>8081</S> thereon: it is a meat offering<S>4503</S>.
And if thy oblation<S>7133</S> be a meat offering<S>4503</S> baken in the fryingpan<S>4802</S>, it shall be made<S>6213</S> of fine flour<S>5560</S> with oil<S>8081</S>.
And thou shalt bring<S>935</S> the meat offering<S>4503</S> that is made<S>6213</S> of these things unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: and when it is presented<S>7126</S> unto the priest<S>3548</S>, he shall bring<S>5066</S> it unto the altar<S>4196</S>.
And the priest<S>3548</S> shall take<S>7311</S> from the meat offering<S>4503</S> a memorial<S>234</S> thereof, and shall burn<S>6999</S> it upon the altar<S>4196</S>: it is an offering made by fire<S>801</S>, of a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And that which is left<S>3498</S> of the meat offering<S>4503</S> shall be Aaron's<S>175</S> and his sons'<S>1121</S>: it is a thing most<S>6944</S> holy<S>6944</S> of the offerings<S>801</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> made by fire<S>801</S>.
No meat offering<S>4503</S>, which ye shall bring<S>7126</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, shall be made<S>6213</S> with leaven<S>2557</S>: for ye shall burn<S>6999</S> no leaven<S>7603</S>, nor any honey<S>1706</S>, in any offering<S>801</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> made by fire<S>801</S>.
As for the oblation<S>7133</S> of the firstfruits<S>7225</S>, ye shall offer<S>7126</S> them unto the LORD<S>3068</S>: but they shall not be burnt<S>5927</S> on the altar<S>4196</S> for a sweet<S>5207</S> savour<S>7381</S>. <sup>be burnt: Heb. ascend</sup>
And every oblation<S>7133</S> of thy meat offering<S>4503</S> shalt thou season<S>4414</S> with salt<S>4417</S>; neither shalt thou suffer the salt<S>4417</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of thy God<S>430</S> to be lacking<S>7673</S> from thy meat offering<S>4503</S>: with all thine offerings<S>7133</S> thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> salt<S>4417</S>.
And if thou offer<S>7126</S> a meat offering<S>4503</S> of thy firstfruits<S>1061</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, thou shalt offer<S>7126</S> for the meat offering<S>4503</S> of thy firstfruits<S>1061</S> green ears<S>24</S> of corn dried<S>7033</S> by the fire<S>784</S>, even corn beaten<S>1643</S> out of full ears<S>3759</S>.
And thou shalt put<S>5414</S> oil<S>8081</S> upon it, and lay<S>7760</S> frankincense<S>3828</S> thereon: it is a meat offering<S>4503</S>.
And the priest<S>3548</S> shall burn<S>6999</S> the memorial<S>234</S> of it, part of the beaten corn<S>1643</S> thereof, and part of the oil<S>8081</S> thereof, with all the frankincense<S>3828</S> thereof: it is an offering made by fire<S>801</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.

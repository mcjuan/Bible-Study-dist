And Saul<S>7586</S> spake<S>1696</S> to Jonathan<S>3129</S> his son<S>1121</S>, and to all his servants<S>5650</S>, that they should kill<S>4191</S> David<S>1732</S>.
But Jonathan<S>3083</S> Saul's<S>7586</S> son<S>1121</S> delighted<S>2654</S> much<S>3966</S> in David<S>1732</S>: and Jonathan<S>3083</S> told<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Saul<S>7586</S> my father<S>1</S> seeketh<S>1245</S> to kill<S>4191</S> thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed<S>8104</S> to thyself until the morning<S>1242</S>, and abide<S>3427</S> in a secret<S>5643</S> place, and hide<S>2244</S> thyself:
And I will go out<S>3318</S> and stand<S>5975</S> beside<S>3027</S> my father<S>1</S> in the field<S>7704</S> where thou art, and I will commune<S>1696</S> with my father<S>1</S> of thee; and what<S>4100</S> I see<S>7200</S>, that I will tell<S>5046</S> thee.
And Jonathan<S>3083</S> spake<S>1696</S> good<S>2896</S> of David<S>1732</S> unto Saul<S>7586</S> his father<S>1</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Let not the king<S>4428</S> sin<S>2398</S> against his servant<S>5650</S>, against David<S>1732</S>; because he hath not sinned<S>2398</S> against thee, and because his works<S>4639</S> have been to thee-ward very<S>3966</S> good<S>2896</S>:
For he did put<S>7760</S> his life<S>5315</S> in his hand<S>3709</S>, and slew<S>5221</S> the Philistine<S>6430</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> wrought<S>6213</S> a great<S>1419</S> salvation<S>8668</S> for all Israel<S>3478</S>: thou sawest<S>7200</S> it, and didst rejoice<S>8055</S>: wherefore then wilt thou sin<S>2398</S> against innocent<S>5355</S> blood<S>1818</S>, to slay<S>4191</S> David<S>1732</S> without a cause<S>2600</S>?
And Saul<S>7586</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto the voice<S>6963</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S>: and Saul<S>7586</S> sware<S>7650</S>, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, he shall not<S>518</S> be slain<S>4191</S>.
And Jonathan<S>3083</S> called<S>7121</S> David<S>1732</S>, and Jonathan<S>3083</S> shewed<S>5046</S> him all those things<S>1697</S>. And Jonathan<S>3083</S> brought<S>935</S> David<S>1732</S> to Saul<S>7586</S>, and he was in his presence<S>6440</S>, as in times past<S>865</S> <S>8032</S>. <sup>in times: Heb. yesterday, third day</sup>
And there was war<S>4421</S> again<S>3254</S>: and David<S>1732</S> went out<S>3318</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and slew<S>5221</S> them with a great<S>1419</S> slaughter<S>4347</S>; and they fled<S>5127</S> from<S>6440</S> him. <sup>him: Heb. his face</sup>
And the evil<S>7451</S> spirit<S>7307</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S> was upon Saul<S>7586</S>, as he sat<S>3427</S> in his house<S>1004</S> with his javelin<S>2595</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>: and David<S>1732</S> played<S>5059</S> with his hand<S>3027</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> sought<S>1245</S> to smite<S>5221</S> David<S>1732</S> even to the wall<S>7023</S> with the javelin<S>2595</S>; but he slipped away<S>6362</S> out of Saul's<S>7586</S> presence<S>6440</S>, and he smote<S>5221</S> the javelin<S>2595</S> into the wall<S>7023</S>: and David<S>1732</S> fled<S>5127</S>, and escaped<S>4422</S> that night<S>3915</S>.
Saul<S>7586</S> also sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> unto David's<S>1732</S> house<S>1004</S>, to watch<S>8104</S> him, and to slay<S>4191</S> him in the morning<S>1242</S>: and Michal<S>4324</S> David's<S>1732</S> wife<S>802</S> told<S>5046</S> him, saying<S>559</S>, If thou save<S>4422</S> not thy life<S>5315</S> to night<S>3915</S>, to morrow<S>4279</S> thou shalt be slain<S>4191</S>.
So Michal<S>4324</S> let<S>3381</S> David<S>1732</S> down<S>3381</S> through a window<S>2474</S>: and he went<S>3212</S>, and fled<S>1272</S>, and escaped<S>4422</S>.
And Michal<S>4324</S> took<S>3947</S> an image<S>8655</S>, and laid<S>7760</S> it in the bed<S>4296</S>, and put<S>7760</S> a pillow<S>3523</S> of goats'<S>5795</S> hair for his bolster<S>4763</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> it with a cloth<S>899</S>. <sup>image: Heb. teraphim</sup>
And when Saul<S>7586</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to take<S>3947</S> David<S>1732</S>, she said<S>559</S>, He is sick<S>2470</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> sent<S>7971</S> the messengers<S>4397</S> again to see<S>7200</S> David<S>1732</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Bring him up<S>5927</S> to me in the bed<S>4296</S>, that I may slay<S>4191</S> him.
And when the messengers<S>4397</S> were come in<S>935</S>, behold, there was an image<S>8655</S> in the bed<S>4296</S>, with a pillow<S>3523</S> of goats'<S>5795</S> hair for his bolster<S>4763</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S> unto Michal<S>4324</S>, Why hast thou deceived me so<S>7411</S>, and sent away<S>7971</S> mine enemy<S>341</S>, that he is escaped<S>4422</S>? And Michal<S>4324</S> answered<S>559</S> Saul<S>7586</S>, He said<S>559</S> unto me, Let me go<S>7971</S>; why should I kill<S>4191</S> thee?
So David<S>1732</S> fled<S>1272</S>, and escaped<S>4422</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Samuel<S>8050</S> to Ramah<S>7414</S>, and told<S>5046</S> him all that Saul<S>7586</S> had done<S>6213</S> to him. And he and Samuel<S>8050</S> went<S>3212</S> and dwelt<S>3427</S> in Naioth<S>5121</S>.
And it was told<S>5046</S> Saul<S>7586</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, David<S>1732</S> is at Naioth<S>5121</S> in Ramah<S>7414</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> to take<S>3947</S> David<S>1732</S>: and when they saw<S>7200</S> the company<S>3862</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S> prophesying<S>5012</S>, and Samuel<S>8050</S> standing<S>5975</S> as appointed<S>5324</S> over them, the Spirit<S>7307</S> of God<S>430</S> was upon the messengers<S>4397</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, and they also prophesied<S>5012</S>.
And when it was told<S>5046</S> Saul<S>7586</S>, he sent<S>7971</S> other<S>312</S> messengers<S>4397</S>, and they prophesied<S>5012</S> likewise. And Saul<S>7586</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> again<S>3254</S> the third<S>7992</S> time, and they prophesied<S>5012</S> also.
Then went<S>3212</S> he also to Ramah<S>7414</S>, and came<S>935</S> to a great<S>1419</S> well<S>953</S> that is in Sechu<S>7906</S>: and he asked<S>7592</S> and said<S>559</S>, Where<S>375</S> are Samuel<S>8050</S> and David<S>1732</S>? And one said<S>559</S>, Behold, they be at Naioth<S>5121</S> in Ramah<S>7414</S>.
And he went<S>3212</S> thither to Naioth<S>5121</S> in Ramah<S>7414</S>: and the Spirit<S>7307</S> of God<S>430</S> was upon him also, and he went<S>3212</S> on<S>1980</S>, and prophesied<S>5012</S>, until he came<S>935</S> to Naioth<S>5121</S> in Ramah<S>7414</S>.
And he stripped off<S>6584</S> his clothes<S>899</S> also<S>1571</S>, and prophesied<S>5012</S> before<S>6440</S> Samuel<S>8050</S> in like manner, and lay down<S>5307</S> naked<S>6174</S> all that day<S>3117</S> and all that night<S>3915</S>. Wherefore they say<S>559</S>, Is Saul<S>7586</S> also among the prophets<S>5030</S>? <sup>lay: Heb. fell</sup>

How doth the city<S>5892</S> sit<S>3427</S> solitary<S>910</S>, that was full<S>7227</S> of people<S>5971</S>! how is she become as a widow<S>490</S>! she that was great<S>7227</S> among the nations<S>1471</S>, and princess<S>8282</S> among the provinces<S>4082</S>, how is she become tributary<S>4522</S>!
She weepeth<S>1058</S> sore<S>1058</S> in the night<S>3915</S>, and her tears<S>1832</S> are on her cheeks<S>3895</S>: among all her lovers<S>157</S> she hath none to comfort<S>5162</S> her: all her friends<S>7453</S> have dealt treacherously<S>898</S> with her, they are become her enemies<S>341</S>.
Judah<S>3063</S> is gone into captivity<S>1540</S> because of affliction<S>6040</S>, and because of great<S>7230</S> servitude<S>5656</S>: she dwelleth<S>3427</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, she findeth<S>4672</S> no rest<S>4494</S>: all her persecutors<S>7291</S> overtook<S>5381</S> her between the straits<S>4712</S>. <sup>because of great: Heb. for the greatness of servitude</sup>
The ways<S>1870</S> of Zion<S>6726</S> do mourn<S>57</S>, because none come<S>935</S> to the solemn feasts<S>4150</S>: all her gates<S>8179</S> are desolate<S>8074</S>: her priests<S>3548</S> sigh<S>584</S>, her virgins<S>1330</S> are afflicted<S>3013</S>, and she is in bitterness<S>4843</S>.
Her adversaries<S>6862</S> are the chief<S>7218</S>, her enemies<S>341</S> prosper<S>7951</S>; for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath afflicted<S>3013</S> her for the multitude<S>7230</S> of her transgressions<S>6588</S>: her children<S>5768</S> are gone<S>1980</S> into captivity<S>7628</S> before<S>6440</S> the enemy<S>6862</S>.
And from the daughter<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S> all her beauty<S>1926</S> is departed<S>3318</S>: her princes<S>8269</S> are become like harts<S>354</S> that find<S>4672</S> no pasture<S>4829</S>, and they are gone<S>3212</S> without strength<S>3581</S> before<S>6440</S> the pursuer<S>7291</S>.
Jerusalem<S>3389</S> remembered<S>2142</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of her affliction<S>6040</S> and of her miseries<S>4788</S> all her pleasant things<S>4262</S> that she had in the days<S>3117</S> of old<S>6924</S>, when her people<S>5971</S> fell<S>5307</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the enemy<S>6862</S>, and none did help<S>5826</S> her: the adversaries<S>6862</S> saw<S>7200</S> her, and did mock<S>7832</S> at her sabbaths<S>4868</S>. <sup>pleasant: or, desirable</sup>
Jerusalem<S>3389</S> hath grievously<S>2399</S> sinned<S>2398</S>; therefore she is removed<S>5206</S>: all that honoured<S>3513</S> her despise<S>2107</S> her, because they have seen<S>7200</S> her nakedness<S>6172</S>: yea, she sigheth<S>584</S>, and turneth<S>7725</S> backward<S>268</S>. <sup>is: Heb. is become a removing, or, wandering</sup>
Her filthiness<S>2932</S> is in her skirts<S>7757</S>; she remembereth<S>2142</S> not her last end<S>319</S>; therefore she came down<S>3381</S> wonderfully<S>6382</S>: she had no comforter<S>5162</S>. O LORD<S>3068</S>, behold<S>7200</S> my affliction<S>6040</S>: for the enemy<S>341</S> hath magnified<S>1431</S> himself.
The adversary<S>6862</S> hath spread out<S>6566</S> his hand<S>3027</S> upon all her pleasant things<S>4261</S>: for she hath seen<S>7200</S> that the heathen<S>1471</S> entered<S>935</S> into her sanctuary<S>4720</S>, whom thou didst command<S>6680</S> that they should not enter<S>935</S> into thy congregation<S>6951</S>. <sup>pleasant: or, desirable</sup>
All her people<S>5971</S> sigh<S>584</S>, they seek<S>1245</S> bread<S>3899</S>; they have given<S>5414</S> their pleasant things<S>4261</S> <S>4262</S> for meat<S>400</S> to relieve<S>7725</S> the soul<S>5315</S>: see<S>7200</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, and consider<S>5027</S>; for I am become vile<S>2151</S>. <sup>to: or, to make the soul to come again</sup>

From above<S>4791</S> hath he sent<S>7971</S> fire<S>784</S> into my bones<S>6106</S>, and it prevaileth<S>7287</S> against them: he hath spread<S>6566</S> a net<S>7568</S> for my feet<S>7272</S>, he hath turned<S>7725</S> me back<S>268</S>: he hath made<S>5414</S> me desolate<S>8074</S> and faint<S>1739</S> all the day<S>3117</S>.
The yoke<S>5923</S> of my transgressions<S>6588</S> is bound<S>8244</S> by his hand<S>3027</S>: they are wreathed<S>8276</S>, and come up<S>5927</S> upon my neck<S>6677</S>: he hath made my strength<S>3581</S> to fall<S>3782</S>, the Lord<S>136</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> me into their hands<S>3027</S>, from whom I am not able<S>3201</S> to rise up<S>6965</S>.
The Lord<S>136</S> hath trodden under foot<S>5541</S> all my mighty<S>47</S> men in the midst<S>7130</S> of me: he hath called<S>7121</S> an assembly<S>4150</S> against me to crush<S>7665</S> my young men<S>970</S>: the Lord<S>136</S> hath trodden<S>1869</S> the virgin<S>1330</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, as in a winepress<S>1660</S>. <sup>the virgin: or, the winepress of the virgin, etc</sup>

Zion<S>6726</S> spreadeth forth<S>6566</S> her hands<S>3027</S>, and there is none to comfort<S>5162</S> her: the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> concerning Jacob<S>3290</S>, that his adversaries<S>6862</S> should be round about<S>5439</S> him: Jerusalem<S>3389</S> is as a menstruous woman<S>5079</S> among them.

Behold<S>7200</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>; for I am in distress<S>6887</S>: my bowels<S>4578</S> are troubled<S>2560</S>; mine heart<S>3820</S> is turned<S>2015</S> within<S>7130</S> me; for I have grievously<S>4784</S> rebelled<S>4784</S>: abroad<S>2351</S> the sword<S>2719</S> bereaveth<S>7921</S>, at home<S>1004</S> there is as death<S>4194</S>.

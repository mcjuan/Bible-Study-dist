And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto Jonah<S>3124</S> the second<S>8145</S> time, saying<S>559</S>,
Arise<S>6965</S>, go<S>3212</S> unto Nineveh<S>5210</S>, that great<S>1419</S> city<S>5892</S>, and preach<S>7121</S> unto it the preaching<S>7150</S> that I bid<S>1696</S> thee.
So Jonah<S>3124</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> unto Nineveh<S>5210</S>, according to the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. Now Nineveh<S>5210</S> was an exceeding<S>430</S> great<S>1419</S> city<S>5892</S> of three<S>7969</S> days'<S>3117</S> journey<S>4109</S>. <sup>exceeding: Heb. of God</sup>
And Jonah<S>3124</S> began<S>2490</S> to enter<S>935</S> into the city<S>5892</S> a<S>259</S> day's<S>3117</S> journey<S>4109</S>, and he cried<S>7121</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Yet forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S>, and Nineveh<S>5210</S> shall be overthrown<S>2015</S>.
So the people<S>582</S> of Nineveh<S>5210</S> believed<S>539</S> God<S>430</S>, and proclaimed<S>7121</S> a fast<S>6685</S>, and put<S>3847</S> on sackcloth<S>8242</S>, from the greatest<S>1419</S> of them even to the least<S>6996</S> of them.
For word<S>1697</S> came<S>5060</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> of Nineveh<S>5210</S>, and he arose<S>6965</S> from his throne<S>3678</S>, and he laid<S>5674</S> his robe<S>155</S> from him, and covered<S>3680</S> him with sackcloth<S>8242</S>, and sat<S>3427</S> in ashes<S>665</S>.
And he caused it to be proclaimed<S>2199</S> and published<S>559</S> through Nineveh<S>5210</S> by the decree<S>2940</S> of the king<S>4428</S> and his nobles<S>1419</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Let neither man<S>120</S> nor beast<S>929</S>, herd<S>1241</S> nor flock<S>6629</S>, taste<S>2938</S> any thing<S>3972</S>: let them not feed<S>7462</S>, nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>: <sup>published: Heb. said</sup> <sup>nobles: Heb. great men</sup>
But let man<S>120</S> and beast<S>929</S> be covered<S>3680</S> with sackcloth<S>8242</S>, and cry<S>7121</S> mightily<S>2394</S> unto God<S>430</S>: yea, let them turn<S>7725</S> every one<S>376</S> from his evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>, and from the violence<S>2555</S> that is in their hands<S>3709</S>.
Who can tell<S>3045</S> if God<S>430</S> will turn<S>7725</S> and repent<S>5162</S>, and turn away<S>7725</S> from his fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S>, that we perish<S>6</S> not?
And God<S>430</S> saw<S>7200</S> their works<S>4639</S>, that they turned<S>7725</S> from their evil<S>7451</S> way<S>1870</S>; and God<S>430</S> repented<S>5162</S> of the evil<S>7451</S>, that he had said<S>1696</S> that he would do<S>6213</S> unto them; and he did<S>6213</S> it not.

Now there was a certain<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> of Ramathaimzophim<S>7436</S>, of mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, and his name<S>8034</S> was Elkanah<S>511</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jeroham<S>3395</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Elihu<S>453</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Tohu<S>8459</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Zuph<S>6689</S>, an Ephrathite<S>673</S>:
And he had two<S>8147</S> wives<S>802</S>; the name<S>8034</S> of the one<S>259</S> was Hannah<S>2584</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of the other<S>8145</S> Peninnah<S>6444</S>: and Peninnah<S>6444</S> had children<S>3206</S>, but Hannah<S>2584</S> had no children<S>3206</S>.
And this<S>1931</S> man<S>376</S> went up<S>5927</S> out of his city<S>5892</S> yearly<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S> to worship<S>7812</S> and to sacrifice<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> in Shiloh<S>7887</S>. And the two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Eli<S>5941</S>, Hophni<S>2652</S> and Phinehas<S>6372</S>, the priests<S>3548</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, were there. <sup>yearly: Heb. from year to year</sup>
And when the time<S>3117</S> was that Elkanah<S>511</S> offered<S>2076</S>, he gave<S>5414</S> to Peninnah<S>6444</S> his wife<S>802</S>, and to all her sons<S>1121</S> and her daughters<S>1323</S>, portions<S>4490</S>:
But unto Hannah<S>2584</S> he gave<S>5414</S> a<S>259</S> worthy<S>639</S> portion<S>4490</S>; for he loved<S>157</S> Hannah<S>2584</S>: but the LORD<S>3068</S> had shut up<S>5462</S> her womb<S>7358</S>. <sup>worthy: or, double</sup>
And her adversary<S>6869</S> also provoked<S>3707</S> her sore<S>3708</S>, for to make her fret<S>7481</S>, because the LORD<S>3068</S> had shut<S>5462</S> up<S>1157</S> her womb<S>7358</S>. <sup>provoked: Heb. angered</sup>
And as he did<S>6213</S> so year<S>8141</S> by year<S>8141</S>, when<S>1767</S> she went up<S>5927</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, so she provoked<S>3707</S> her; therefore she wept<S>1058</S>, and did not eat<S>398</S>. <sup>when: or, from the time that she, etc: Heb. from her going up</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Elkanah<S>511</S> her husband<S>376</S> to her, Hannah<S>2584</S>, why weepest<S>1058</S> thou? and why eatest<S>398</S> thou not? and why is thy heart<S>3824</S> grieved<S>3415</S>? am not I better<S>2896</S> to thee than ten<S>6235</S> sons<S>1121</S>?
So Hannah<S>2584</S> rose up<S>6965</S> after<S>310</S> they had eaten<S>398</S> in Shiloh<S>7887</S>, and after<S>310</S> they had drunk<S>8354</S>. Now Eli<S>5941</S> the priest<S>3548</S> sat<S>3427</S> upon a seat<S>3678</S> by a post<S>4201</S> of the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And she was in bitterness<S>4751</S> of soul<S>5315</S>, and prayed<S>6419</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and wept<S>1058</S> sore<S>1058</S>. <sup>in: Heb. bitter of soul</sup>
And she vowed<S>5087</S> a vow<S>5088</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, if thou wilt indeed<S>7200</S> look<S>7200</S> on the affliction<S>6040</S> of thine handmaid<S>519</S>, and remember<S>2142</S> me, and not forget<S>7911</S> thine handmaid<S>519</S>, but wilt give<S>5414</S> unto thine handmaid<S>519</S> a man<S>582</S> child<S>2233</S>, then I will give<S>5414</S> him unto the LORD<S>3068</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>, and there shall no razor<S>4177</S> come<S>5927</S> upon his head<S>7218</S>. <sup>a man: Heb. seed of men</sup>
And it came to pass, as she continued<S>7235</S> praying<S>6419</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, that Eli<S>5941</S> marked<S>8104</S> her mouth<S>6310</S>. <sup>continued: Heb. multiplied to pray</sup>
Now Hannah<S>2584</S>, she spake<S>1696</S> in her heart<S>3820</S>; only her lips<S>8193</S> moved<S>5128</S>, but her voice<S>6963</S> was not heard<S>8085</S>: therefore Eli<S>5941</S> thought<S>2803</S> she had been drunken<S>7910</S>.
And Eli<S>5941</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken<S>7937</S>? put away<S>5493</S> thy wine<S>3196</S> from thee.
And Hannah<S>2584</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, No, my lord<S>113</S>, I am a woman<S>802</S> of a sorrowful<S>7186</S> spirit<S>7307</S>: I have drunk<S>8354</S> neither wine<S>3196</S> nor strong drink<S>7941</S>, but have poured out<S>8210</S> my soul<S>5315</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>of a sorrowful: Heb. hard of spirit</sup>
Count<S>5414</S> not thine handmaid<S>519</S> for<S>6440</S> a daughter<S>1323</S> of Belial<S>1100</S>: for out of the abundance<S>7230</S> of my complaint<S>7879</S> and grief<S>3708</S> have I spoken<S>1696</S> hitherto. <sup>complaint: or, meditation</sup>
Then Eli<S>5941</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S> in peace<S>7965</S>: and the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> grant<S>5414</S> thee thy petition<S>7596</S> that thou hast asked<S>7592</S> of him.
And she said<S>559</S>, Let thine handmaid<S>8198</S> find<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>. So the woman<S>802</S> went<S>3212</S> her way<S>1870</S>, and did eat<S>398</S>, and her countenance<S>6440</S> was no more sad.
And they rose up<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S> early<S>7925</S>, and worshipped<S>7812</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and returned<S>7725</S>, and came<S>935</S> to their house<S>1004</S> to Ramah<S>7414</S>: and Elkanah<S>511</S> knew<S>3045</S> Hannah<S>2584</S> his wife<S>802</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> remembered<S>2142</S> her.
Wherefore it came to pass, when the time<S>3117</S> was come<S>8622</S> about after Hannah<S>2584</S> had conceived<S>2029</S>, that she bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>, and called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Samuel<S>8050</S>, saying, Because I have asked<S>7592</S> him of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>when: Heb. in revolution of days</sup> <sup>Samuel: that is, Asked of God</sup>
And the man<S>376</S> Elkanah<S>511</S>, and all his house<S>1004</S>, went up<S>5927</S> to offer<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> the yearly<S>3117</S> sacrifice<S>2077</S>, and his vow<S>5088</S>.
But Hannah<S>2584</S> went not up<S>5927</S>; for she said<S>559</S> unto her husband<S>376</S>, I will not go up until the child<S>5288</S> be weaned<S>1580</S>, and then I will bring<S>935</S> him, that he may appear<S>7200</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and there abide<S>3427</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
And Elkanah<S>511</S> her husband<S>376</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Do<S>6213</S> what seemeth<S>5869</S> thee good<S>2896</S>; tarry<S>3427</S> until thou have weaned<S>1580</S> him; only the LORD<S>3068</S> establish<S>6965</S> his word<S>1697</S>. So the woman<S>802</S> abode<S>3427</S>, and gave her son<S>1121</S> suck<S>3243</S> until she weaned<S>1580</S> him.
And when she had weaned<S>1580</S> him, she took him up<S>5927</S> with her, with three<S>7969</S> bullocks<S>6499</S>, and one<S>259</S> ephah<S>374</S> of flour<S>7058</S>, and a bottle<S>5035</S> of wine<S>3196</S>, and brought<S>935</S> him unto the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in Shiloh<S>7887</S>: and the child<S>5288</S> was young<S>5288</S>.
And they slew<S>7819</S> a bullock<S>6499</S>, and brought<S>935</S> the child<S>5288</S> to Eli<S>5941</S>.
And she said<S>559</S>, Oh<S>994</S> my lord<S>113</S>, as thy soul<S>5315</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, my lord<S>113</S>, I am the woman<S>802</S> that stood<S>5324</S> by thee here, praying<S>6419</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
For this child<S>5288</S> I prayed<S>6419</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> me my petition<S>7596</S> which I asked<S>7592</S> of him:
Therefore also I have lent<S>7592</S> him to the LORD<S>3068</S>; as long as he liveth<S>3117</S> he shall be lent<S>7592</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>. And he worshipped<S>7812</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> there. <sup>lent him: or, returned him, whom I have obtained by petition</sup> <sup>he shall: or, he whom I have obtained by petition shall be returned</sup>

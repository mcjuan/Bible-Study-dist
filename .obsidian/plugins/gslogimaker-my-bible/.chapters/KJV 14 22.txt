And the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> made<S>4427</S> Ahaziah<S>274</S> his youngest<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S> king<S>4427</S> in his stead: for the band of men<S>1416</S> that came<S>935</S> with the Arabians<S>6163</S> to the camp<S>4264</S> had slain<S>2026</S> all the eldest<S>7223</S>. So Ahaziah<S>274</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoram<S>3088</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> reigned<S>4427</S>.
Forty<S>705</S> and two<S>8147</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> was Ahaziah<S>274</S> when he began to reign<S>4427</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> one<S>259</S> year<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. His mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> also was Athaliah<S>6271</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Omri<S>6018</S>.
He also walked<S>1980</S> in the ways<S>1870</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Ahab<S>256</S>: for his mother<S>517</S> was his counsellor<S>3289</S> to do wickedly<S>7561</S>.
Wherefore he did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> like the house<S>1004</S> of Ahab<S>256</S>: for they were his counsellors<S>3289</S> after<S>310</S> the death<S>4194</S> of his father<S>1</S> to his destruction<S>4889</S>.
He walked<S>1980</S> also after their counsel<S>6098</S>, and went<S>3212</S> with Jehoram<S>3088</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahab<S>256</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to war<S>4421</S> against Hazael<S>2371</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> at Ramothgilead<S>7433</S> <S>1568</S>: and the Syrians<S>7421</S> smote<S>5221</S> Joram<S>3141</S>.
And he returned<S>7725</S> to be healed<S>7495</S> in Jezreel<S>3157</S> because of the wounds<S>4347</S> which were given<S>5221</S> him at Ramah<S>7414</S>, when he fought<S>3898</S> with Hazael<S>2371</S> king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>. And Azariah<S>5838</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoram<S>3088</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> went down<S>3381</S> to see<S>7200</S> Jehoram<S>3088</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahab<S>256</S> at Jezreel<S>3157</S>, because he was sick<S>2470</S>. <sup>which: Heb. wherewith they wounded him</sup> <sup>Azariah: also called, Ahaziah, ver.I. or, Jehoahaz, ver.21.17.</sup>
And the destruction<S>8395</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S> was of God<S>430</S> by coming<S>935</S> to Joram<S>3141</S>: for when he was come<S>935</S>, he went out<S>3318</S> with Jehoram<S>3088</S> against Jehu<S>3058</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nimshi<S>5250</S>, whom the LORD<S>3068</S> had anointed<S>4886</S> to cut off<S>3772</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Ahab<S>256</S>. <sup>destruction: Heb. treading down</sup>
And it came to pass, that, when Jehu<S>3058</S> was executing judgment<S>8199</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of Ahab<S>256</S>, and found<S>4672</S> the princes<S>8269</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and the sons<S>1121</S> of the brethren<S>251</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S>, that ministered<S>8334</S> to Ahaziah<S>274</S>, he slew<S>2026</S> them.
And he sought<S>1245</S> Ahaziah<S>274</S>: and they caught<S>3920</S> him, (for he was hid<S>2244</S> in Samaria<S>8111</S>,) and brought<S>935</S> him to Jehu<S>3058</S>: and when they had slain<S>4191</S> him, they buried<S>6912</S> him: Because, said<S>559</S> they, he is the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S>, who sought<S>1875</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with all his heart<S>3824</S>. So the house<S>1004</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S> had no power<S>3581</S> to keep<S>6113</S> still the kingdom<S>4467</S>.
But when Athaliah<S>6271</S> the mother<S>517</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S> saw<S>7200</S> that her son<S>1121</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, she arose<S>6965</S> and destroyed<S>1696</S> all the seed<S>2233</S> royal<S>4467</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
But Jehoshabeath<S>3090</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of the king<S>4428</S>, took<S>3947</S> Joash<S>3101</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S>, and stole<S>1589</S> him from among<S>8432</S> the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> that were slain<S>4191</S>, and put<S>5414</S> him and his nurse<S>3243</S> in a bedchamber<S>2315</S> <S>4296</S>. So Jehoshabeath<S>3090</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of king<S>4428</S> Jehoram<S>3088</S>, the wife<S>802</S> of Jehoiada<S>3077</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, (for she was the sister<S>269</S> of Ahaziah<S>274</S>,) hid<S>5641</S> him from<S>6440</S> Athaliah<S>6271</S>, so that she slew<S>4191</S> him not.
And he was with them hid<S>2244</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> six<S>8337</S> years<S>8141</S>: and Athaliah<S>6271</S> reigned<S>4427</S> over the land<S>776</S>.

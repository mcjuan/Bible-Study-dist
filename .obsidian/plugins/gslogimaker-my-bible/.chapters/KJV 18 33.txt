Wherefore<S>199</S>, Job<S>347</S>, I pray thee, hear<S>8085</S> my speeches<S>4405</S>, and hearken<S>238</S> to all my words<S>1697</S>.
Behold, now I have opened<S>6605</S> my mouth<S>6310</S>, my tongue<S>3956</S> hath spoken<S>1696</S> in my mouth<S>2441</S>. <sup>in my mouth: Heb. in my palate</sup>
My words<S>561</S> shall be of the uprightness<S>3476</S> of my heart<S>3820</S>: and my lips<S>8193</S> shall utter<S>4448</S> knowledge<S>1847</S> clearly<S>1305</S>.
The Spirit<S>7307</S> of God<S>410</S> hath made<S>6213</S> me, and the breath<S>5397</S> of the Almighty<S>7706</S> hath given me life<S>2421</S>.
If thou canst<S>3201</S> answer<S>7725</S> me, set thy words in order<S>6186</S> before<S>6440</S> me, stand up<S>3320</S>.
Behold, I am according to thy wish<S>6310</S> in God's<S>410</S> stead: I also am formed<S>7169</S> out of the clay<S>2563</S>. <sup>wish: Heb. mouth</sup> <sup>formed: Heb. cut</sup>
Behold, my terror<S>367</S> shall not make thee afraid<S>1204</S>, neither shall my hand<S>405</S> be heavy<S>3513</S> upon thee.
Surely thou hast spoken<S>559</S> in mine hearing<S>241</S>, and I have heard<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of thy words<S>4405</S>, saying, <sup>hearing: Heb. ears</sup>
I am clean<S>2134</S> without transgression<S>6588</S>, I am innocent<S>2643</S>; neither is there iniquity<S>5771</S> in me.
Behold, he findeth<S>4672</S> occasions<S>8569</S> against me, he counteth<S>2803</S> me for his enemy<S>341</S>,
He putteth<S>7760</S> my feet<S>7272</S> in the stocks<S>5465</S>, he marketh<S>8104</S> all my paths<S>734</S>.
Behold, in this thou art not just<S>6663</S>: I will answer<S>6030</S> thee, that God<S>433</S> is greater<S>7235</S> than man<S>582</S>.
Why dost thou strive<S>7378</S> against him? for he giveth not account<S>6030</S> of any of his matters<S>1697</S>. <sup>he giveth: Heb. he answereth not</sup>
For God<S>410</S> speaketh<S>1696</S> once<S>259</S>, yea twice<S>8147</S>, yet man perceiveth<S>7789</S> it not.
In a dream<S>2472</S>, in a vision<S>2384</S> of the night<S>3915</S>, when deep<S>8639</S> sleep falleth<S>5307</S> upon men<S>582</S>, in slumberings<S>8572</S> upon the bed<S>4904</S>;
Then he openeth<S>1540</S> the ears<S>241</S> of men<S>582</S>, and sealeth<S>2856</S> their instruction<S>4561</S>, <sup>he: Heb. he revealeth, or, uncovereth</sup>
That he may withdraw<S>5493</S> man<S>120</S> from his purpose<S>4639</S>, and hide<S>3680</S> pride<S>1466</S> from man<S>1397</S>. <sup>purpose: Heb. work</sup>
He keepeth back<S>2820</S> his soul<S>5315</S> from the pit<S>7845</S>, and his life<S>2416</S> from perishing<S>5674</S> by the sword<S>7973</S>. <sup>from perishing: Heb. from passing</sup>
He is chastened<S>3198</S> also with pain<S>4341</S> upon his bed<S>4904</S>, and the multitude<S>7230</S> <S>7379</S> of his bones<S>6106</S> with strong<S>386</S> pain:
So that his life<S>2416</S> abhorreth<S>2092</S> bread<S>3899</S>, and his soul<S>5315</S> dainty<S>8378</S> meat<S>3978</S>. <sup>dainty: Heb. meat of desire</sup>
His flesh<S>1320</S> is consumed away<S>3615</S>, that it cannot be seen<S>7210</S>; and his bones<S>6106</S> that were not seen<S>7200</S> stick out<S>8192</S> <S>8205</S>.
Yea, his soul<S>5315</S> draweth near<S>7126</S> unto the grave<S>7845</S>, and his life<S>2416</S> to the destroyers<S>4191</S>.
If there<S>3426</S> be a messenger<S>4397</S> with him, an interpreter<S>3887</S>, one<S>259</S> among a thousand<S>505</S>, to shew<S>5046</S> unto man<S>120</S> his uprightness<S>3476</S>:
Then he is gracious<S>2603</S> unto him, and saith<S>559</S>, Deliver<S>6308</S> him from going down<S>3381</S> to the pit<S>7845</S>: I have found<S>4672</S> a ransom<S>3724</S>. <sup>a ransom: or, an atonement</sup>
His flesh<S>1320</S> shall be fresher<S>7375</S> than a child's<S>5290</S>: he shall return<S>7725</S> to the days<S>3117</S> of his youth<S>5934</S>: <sup>a child's: Heb. childhood</sup>
He shall pray<S>6279</S> unto God<S>433</S>, and he will be favourable<S>7521</S> unto him: and he shall see<S>7200</S> his face<S>6440</S> with joy<S>8643</S>: for he will render<S>7725</S> unto man<S>582</S> his righteousness<S>6666</S>.
He looketh<S>7789</S> upon men<S>582</S>, and if any say<S>559</S>, I have sinned<S>2398</S>, and perverted<S>5753</S> that which was right<S>3477</S>, and it profited<S>7737</S> me not; <sup>He: or, He shall look upon men, and say</sup>
He will deliver<S>6299</S> his soul<S>5315</S> from going<S>5674</S> into the pit<S>7845</S>, and his life<S>2416</S> shall see<S>7200</S> the light<S>216</S>. <sup>He: or, He hath delivered my soul, etc, and my life</sup>
Lo, all these things worketh<S>6466</S> God<S>410</S> oftentimes<S>6471</S> <S>7969</S> with man<S>1397</S>, <sup>oftentimes: Heb. twice and thrice</sup>
To bring back<S>7725</S> his soul<S>5315</S> from the pit<S>7845</S>, to be enlightened<S>215</S> with the light<S>216</S> of the living<S>2416</S>.
Mark well<S>7181</S>, O Job<S>347</S>, hearken<S>8085</S> unto me: hold thy peace<S>2790</S>, and I will speak<S>1696</S>.
If thou hast<S>3426</S> any thing to say<S>4405</S>, answer<S>7725</S> me: speak<S>1696</S>, for I desire<S>2654</S> to justify<S>6663</S> thee.
If not, hearken<S>8085</S> unto me: hold thy peace<S>2790</S>, and I shall teach<S>502</S> thee wisdom<S>2451</S>.

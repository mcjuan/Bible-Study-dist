And the men<S>376</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> gathered themselves together<S>6817</S>, and went<S>5674</S> northward<S>6828</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto Jephthah<S>3316</S>, Wherefore passedst thou over<S>5674</S> to fight<S>3898</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and didst not call<S>7121</S> us to go<S>3212</S> with thee? we will burn<S>8313</S> thine house<S>1004</S> upon thee with fire<S>784</S>. <sup>gathered: Heb. were called</sup>
And Jephthah<S>3316</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, I and my people<S>5971</S> were<S>1961</S> at great<S>3966</S> strife<S>376</S> <S>7379</S> with the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>; and when I called<S>2199</S> you, ye delivered<S>3467</S> me not out of their hands<S>3027</S>.
And when I saw<S>7200</S> that ye delivered<S>3467</S> me not, I put<S>7760</S> my life<S>5315</S> in my hands<S>3709</S>, and passed over<S>5674</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> delivered<S>5414</S> them into my hand<S>3027</S>: wherefore then are ye come up<S>5927</S> unto me this day<S>3117</S>, to fight<S>3898</S> against me?
Then Jephthah<S>3316</S> gathered together<S>6908</S> all the men<S>582</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with Ephraim<S>669</S>: and the men<S>582</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S> smote<S>5221</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, because they said<S>559</S>, Ye Gileadites<S>1568</S> are fugitives<S>6412</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> among<S>8432</S> the Ephraimites<S>669</S>, and among<S>8432</S> the Manassites<S>4519</S>.
And the Gileadites<S>1568</S> took<S>3920</S> the passages<S>4569</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> before the Ephraimites<S>669</S>: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites<S>669</S> which were escaped<S>6412</S> said<S>559</S>, Let me go over<S>5674</S>; that the men<S>582</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite<S>673</S>? If he said<S>559</S>, Nay;
Then said<S>559</S> they unto him, Say<S>559</S> now Shibboleth<S>7641</S>: and he said<S>559</S> Sibboleth<S>5451</S>: for he could not frame<S>3559</S> to pronounce<S>1696</S> it right<S>3559</S>. Then they took<S>270</S> him, and slew<S>7819</S> him at the passages<S>4569</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>: and there fell<S>5307</S> at that time<S>6256</S> of the Ephraimites<S>669</S> forty<S>705</S> and two<S>8147</S> thousand<S>505</S>.
And Jephthah<S>3316</S> judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> six<S>8337</S> years<S>8141</S>. Then died<S>4191</S> Jephthah<S>3316</S> the Gileadite<S>1569</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in one of the cities<S>5892</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And after<S>310</S> him Ibzan<S>78</S> of Bethlehem<S>1035</S> judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he had thirty<S>7970</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and thirty<S>7970</S> daughters<S>1323</S>, whom he sent<S>7971</S> abroad<S>2351</S>, and took<S>935</S> in thirty<S>7970</S> daughters<S>1323</S> from abroad<S>2351</S> for his sons<S>1121</S>. And he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>.
Then died<S>4191</S> Ibzan<S>78</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> at Bethlehem<S>1035</S>.
And after<S>310</S> him Elon<S>356</S>, a Zebulonite<S>2075</S>, judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S>; and he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> ten<S>6235</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And Elon<S>356</S> the Zebulonite<S>2075</S> died<S>4191</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in Aijalon<S>357</S> in the country<S>776</S> of Zebulun<S>2074</S>.
And after<S>310</S> him Abdon<S>5658</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hillel<S>1985</S>, a Pirathonite<S>6553</S>, judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he had forty<S>705</S> sons<S>1121</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> nephews<S>1121</S> <S>1121</S>, that rode<S>7392</S> on threescore and ten<S>7657</S> ass colts<S>5895</S>: and he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> eight<S>8083</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>nephews: Heb. sons' sons</sup>
And Abdon<S>5658</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hillel<S>1985</S> the Pirathonite<S>6553</S> died<S>4191</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in Pirathon<S>6552</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, in the mount<S>2022</S> of the Amalekites<S>6003</S>.

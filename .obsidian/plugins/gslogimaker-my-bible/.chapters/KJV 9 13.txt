Saul<S>7586</S> reigned<S>4427</S> one year<S>1121</S> <S>8141</S>; and when he had reigned<S>4427</S> two<S>8147</S> years<S>8141</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>, <sup>reigned one: Heb. the son of one year in his reigning</sup>
Saul<S>7586</S> chose<S>977</S> him three<S>7969</S> thousand<S>505</S> men of Israel<S>3478</S>; whereof two thousand<S>505</S> were with Saul<S>7586</S> in Michmash<S>4363</S> and in mount<S>2022</S> Bethel<S>1008</S>, and a thousand<S>505</S> were with Jonathan<S>3129</S> in Gibeah<S>1390</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>: and the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S> he sent<S>7971</S> every man<S>376</S> to his tent<S>168</S>.
And Jonathan<S>3129</S> smote<S>5221</S> the garrison<S>5333</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> that was in Geba<S>1387</S>, and the Philistines<S>6430</S> heard<S>8085</S> of it. And Saul<S>7586</S> blew<S>8628</S> the trumpet<S>7782</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Let the Hebrews<S>5680</S> hear<S>8085</S>. <sup>Geba: or, the hill</sup>
And all Israel<S>3478</S> heard<S>8085</S> say<S>559</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> had smitten<S>5221</S> a garrison<S>5333</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and that Israel<S>3478</S> also was had in abomination<S>887</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>. And the people<S>5971</S> were called together<S>6817</S> after<S>310</S> Saul<S>7586</S> to Gilgal<S>1537</S>. <sup>was: Heb. did stink</sup>
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered themselves together<S>622</S> to fight<S>3898</S> with Israel<S>3478</S>, thirty<S>7970</S> thousand<S>505</S> chariots<S>7393</S>, and six<S>8337</S> thousand<S>505</S> horsemen<S>6571</S>, and people<S>5971</S> as the sand<S>2344</S> which is on the sea<S>3220</S> shore<S>8193</S> in multitude<S>7230</S>: and they came up<S>5927</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> in Michmash<S>4363</S>, eastward<S>6926</S> from Bethaven<S>1007</S>.
When the men<S>376</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> saw<S>7200</S> that they were in a strait<S>6887</S>, (for the people<S>5971</S> were distressed<S>5065</S>,) then the people<S>5971</S> did hide<S>2244</S> themselves in caves<S>4631</S>, and in thickets<S>2337</S>, and in rocks<S>5553</S>, and in high places<S>6877</S>, and in pits<S>953</S>.
And some of the Hebrews<S>5680</S> went over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> to the land<S>776</S> of Gad<S>1410</S> and Gilead<S>1568</S>. As for Saul<S>7586</S>, he was yet in Gilgal<S>1537</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> followed<S>310</S> him trembling<S>2729</S>. <sup>followed: Heb. trembled after him</sup>
And he tarried<S>3176</S> <S>3176</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, according to the set time<S>4150</S> that Samuel<S>8050</S> had appointed: but Samuel<S>8050</S> came<S>935</S> not to Gilgal<S>1537</S>; and the people<S>5971</S> were scattered<S>6327</S> from him.
And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S>, Bring hither<S>5066</S> a burnt offering<S>5930</S> to me, and peace offerings<S>8002</S>. And he offered<S>5927</S> the burnt offering<S>5930</S>.
And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end<S>3615</S> of offering<S>5927</S> the burnt offering<S>5930</S>, behold, Samuel<S>8050</S> came<S>935</S>; and Saul<S>7586</S> went out<S>3318</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him, that he might salute<S>1288</S> him. <sup>salute: Heb. bless</sup>
And Samuel<S>8050</S> said<S>559</S>, What hast thou done<S>6213</S>? And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S>, Because I saw<S>7200</S> that the people<S>5971</S> were scattered<S>5310</S> from me, and that thou camest<S>935</S> not within the days<S>3117</S> appointed<S>4150</S>, and that the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered themselves together<S>622</S> at Michmash<S>4363</S>;
Therefore said<S>559</S> I, The Philistines<S>6430</S> will come down<S>3381</S> now upon me to Gilgal<S>1537</S>, and I have not made supplication<S>2470</S> unto<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: I forced<S>662</S> myself therefore, and offered<S>5927</S> a burnt offering<S>5930</S>. <sup>made: Heb. intreated the face</sup>
And Samuel<S>8050</S> said<S>559</S> to Saul<S>7586</S>, Thou hast done foolishly<S>5528</S>: thou hast not kept<S>8104</S> the commandment<S>4687</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, which he commanded<S>6680</S> thee: for now would the LORD<S>3068</S> have established<S>3559</S> thy kingdom<S>4467</S> upon Israel<S>3478</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
But now thy kingdom<S>4467</S> shall not continue<S>6965</S>: the LORD<S>3068</S> hath sought<S>1245</S> him a man<S>376</S> after his own heart<S>3824</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> him to be captain<S>5057</S> over his people<S>5971</S>, because thou hast not kept<S>8104</S> that which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> thee.
And Samuel<S>8050</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and gat him up<S>5927</S> from Gilgal<S>1537</S> unto Gibeah<S>1390</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>. And Saul<S>7586</S> numbered<S>6485</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were present<S>4672</S> with him, about six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S>. <sup>present: Heb. found</sup>
And Saul<S>7586</S>, and Jonathan<S>3129</S> his son<S>1121</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> that were present<S>4672</S> with them, abode<S>3427</S> in Gibeah<S>1387</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>: but the Philistines<S>6430</S> encamped<S>2583</S> in Michmash<S>4363</S>. <sup>present: Heb. found</sup> <sup>Gibeah: Heb. Geba</sup>
And the spoilers<S>7843</S> came out<S>3318</S> of the camp<S>4264</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> in three<S>7969</S> companies<S>7218</S>: one<S>259</S> company<S>7218</S> turned<S>6437</S> unto the way<S>1870</S> that leadeth to Ophrah<S>6084</S>, unto the land<S>776</S> of Shual<S>7777</S>:
And another<S>259</S> company<S>7218</S> turned<S>6437</S> the way<S>1870</S> to Bethhoron<S>1032</S>: and another<S>259</S> company<S>7218</S> turned<S>6437</S> to the way<S>1870</S> of the border<S>1366</S> that looketh<S>8259</S> to the valley<S>1516</S> of Zeboim<S>6650</S> toward the wilderness<S>4057</S>.
Now there was no smith<S>2796</S> found<S>4672</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: for the Philistines<S>6430</S> said<S>559</S>, Lest the Hebrews<S>5680</S> make<S>6213</S> them swords<S>2719</S> or spears<S>2595</S>:
But all the Israelites<S>3478</S> went down<S>3381</S> to the Philistines<S>6430</S>, to sharpen<S>3913</S> every man<S>376</S> his share<S>4282</S>, and his coulter<S>855</S>, and his axe<S>7134</S>, and his mattock<S>4281</S>.
Yet they had a file<S>6477</S> <S>6310</S> for the mattocks<S>4281</S>, and for the coulters<S>855</S>, and for the forks<S>7969</S> <S>7053</S>, and for the axes<S>7134</S>, and to sharpen<S>5324</S> the goads<S>1861</S>. <sup>a file: Heb. a file with mouths</sup> <sup>sharpen: Heb. to set</sup>
So it came to pass in the day<S>3117</S> of battle<S>4421</S>, that there was neither sword<S>2719</S> nor spear<S>2595</S> found<S>4672</S> in the hand<S>3027</S> of any of the people<S>5971</S> that were with Saul<S>7586</S> and Jonathan<S>3129</S>: but with Saul<S>7586</S> and with Jonathan<S>3129</S> his son<S>1121</S> was there found<S>4672</S>.
And the garrison<S>4673</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> went out<S>3318</S> to the passage<S>4569</S> of Michmash<S>4363</S>. <sup>garrison: or, standing camp</sup>

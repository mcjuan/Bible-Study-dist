And after<S>310</S> Abimelech<S>40</S> there arose<S>6965</S> to defend<S>3467</S> Israel<S>3478</S> Tola<S>8439</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Puah<S>6312</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Dodo<S>1734</S>, a man<S>376</S> of Issachar<S>3485</S>; and he dwelt<S>3427</S> in Shamir<S>8069</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>. <sup>defend: or, deliver: Heb. save</sup>
And he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S>, and died<S>4191</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in Shamir<S>8069</S>.
And after<S>310</S> him arose<S>6965</S> Jair<S>2971</S>, a Gileadite<S>1569</S>, and judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and two<S>8147</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And he had thirty<S>7970</S> sons<S>1121</S> that rode<S>7392</S> on thirty<S>7970</S> ass colts<S>5895</S>, and they had thirty<S>7970</S> cities<S>5892</S>, which are called<S>7121</S> Havothjair<S>2334</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>, which are in the land<S>776</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>. <sup>Havothjair: or, the villages of Jair</sup>
And Jair<S>2971</S> died<S>4191</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> in Camon<S>7056</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> again<S>3254</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and served<S>5647</S> Baalim<S>1168</S>, and Ashtaroth<S>6252</S>, and the gods<S>430</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, and the gods<S>430</S> of Zidon<S>6721</S>, and the gods<S>430</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, and the gods<S>430</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and the gods<S>430</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and forsook<S>5800</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and served<S>5647</S> not him.
And the anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was hot<S>2734</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>, and he sold<S>4376</S> them into the hands<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and into the hands<S>3027</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>.
And that year<S>8141</S> they vexed<S>7492</S> and oppressed<S>7533</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: eighteen<S>8083</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>, all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> that were on the other side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> in the land<S>776</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, which is in Gilead<S>1568</S>. <sup>oppressed: Heb. crushed</sup>
Moreover the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> passed over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> to fight<S>3898</S> also against Judah<S>3063</S>, and against Benjamin<S>1144</S>, and against the house<S>1004</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>; so that Israel<S>3478</S> was sore<S>3966</S> distressed<S>3334</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> cried<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, We have sinned<S>2398</S> against thee, both because we have forsaken<S>5800</S> our God<S>430</S>, and also served<S>5647</S> Baalim<S>1168</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians<S>4714</S>, and from the Amorites<S>567</S>, from the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>, and from the Philistines<S>6430</S>?
The Zidonians<S>6722</S> also, and the Amalekites<S>6002</S>, and the Maonites<S>4584</S>, did oppress<S>3905</S> you; and ye cried<S>6817</S> to me, and I delivered<S>3467</S> you out of their hand<S>3027</S>.
Yet ye have forsaken<S>5800</S> me, and served<S>5647</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>: wherefore I will deliver<S>3467</S> you no more<S>3254</S>.
Go<S>3212</S> and cry<S>2199</S> unto the gods<S>430</S> which ye have chosen<S>977</S>; let them<S>1992</S> deliver<S>3467</S> you in the time<S>6256</S> of your tribulation<S>6869</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, We have sinned<S>2398</S>: do<S>6213</S> thou unto us whatsoever seemeth<S>5869</S> good<S>2896</S> unto thee; deliver<S>5337</S> us only, we pray thee, this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>seemeth: Heb. is good in thine eyes</sup>
And they put away<S>5493</S> the strange<S>5236</S> gods<S>430</S> from among<S>7130</S> them, and served<S>5647</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and his soul<S>5315</S> was grieved<S>7114</S> for the misery<S>5999</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>strange: Heb. gods of strangers</sup> <sup>grieved: Heb. shortened</sup>
Then the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> were gathered together<S>6817</S>, and encamped<S>2583</S> in Gilead<S>1568</S>. And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> assembled themselves together<S>622</S>, and encamped<S>2583</S> in Mizpeh<S>4709</S>. <sup>gathered: Heb. cried</sup>
And the people<S>5971</S> and princes<S>8269</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S> said<S>559</S> one<S>376</S> to another<S>7453</S>, What man<S>376</S> is he that will begin<S>2490</S> to fight<S>3898</S> against the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S>? he shall be head<S>7218</S> over all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>.

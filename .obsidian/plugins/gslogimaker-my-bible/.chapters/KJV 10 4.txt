And when Saul's<S>7586</S> son<S>1121</S> heard<S>8085</S> that Abner<S>74</S> was dead<S>4191</S> in Hebron<S>2275</S>, his hands<S>3027</S> were feeble<S>7503</S>, and all the Israelites<S>3478</S> were troubled<S>926</S>.
And Saul's<S>7586</S> son<S>1121</S> had<S>1961</S> two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> that were captains<S>8269</S> of bands<S>1416</S>: the name<S>8034</S> of the one<S>259</S> was Baanah<S>1196</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of the other<S>8145</S> Rechab<S>7394</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S> a Beerothite<S>886</S>, of the children<S>1121</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>: (for Beeroth<S>881</S> also was reckoned<S>2803</S> to Benjamin<S>1144</S>: <sup>other: Heb. second</sup>
And the Beerothites<S>886</S> fled<S>1272</S> to Gittaim<S>1664</S>, and were sojourners<S>1481</S> there until this day<S>3117</S>.)
And Jonathan<S>3083</S>, Saul's<S>7586</S> son<S>1121</S>, had a son<S>1121</S> that was lame<S>5223</S> of his feet<S>7272</S>. He was five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when the tidings<S>8052</S> came<S>935</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> and Jonathan<S>3083</S> out of Jezreel<S>3157</S>, and his nurse<S>539</S> took him up<S>5375</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>: and it came to pass, as she made haste<S>2648</S> to flee<S>5127</S>, that he fell<S>5307</S>, and became lame<S>6452</S>. And his name<S>8034</S> was Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>. <sup>Mephibosheth: or, Meribbaal</sup>
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S> the Beerothite<S>886</S>, Rechab<S>7394</S> and Baanah<S>1196</S>, went<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> about the heat<S>2527</S> of the day<S>3117</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of Ishbosheth<S>378</S>, who lay<S>7901</S> on a bed<S>4904</S> at noon<S>6672</S>.
And they came thither<S>935</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, as though they would have fetched<S>3947</S> wheat<S>2406</S>; and they smote<S>5221</S> him under the fifth<S>2570</S> rib: and Rechab<S>7394</S> and Baanah<S>1196</S> his brother<S>251</S> escaped<S>4422</S>.
For when they came<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S>, he lay<S>7901</S> on his bed<S>4296</S> in his bedchamber<S>2315</S> <S>4904</S>, and they smote<S>5221</S> him, and slew<S>4191</S> him, and beheaded<S>5493</S> him, and took<S>3947</S> his head<S>7218</S>, and gat them away<S>3212</S> through<S>1870</S> the plain<S>6160</S> all night<S>3915</S>.
And they brought<S>935</S> the head<S>7218</S> of Ishbosheth<S>378</S> unto David<S>1732</S> to Hebron<S>2275</S>, and said<S>559</S> to the king<S>4428</S>, Behold the head<S>7218</S> of Ishbosheth<S>378</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> thine enemy<S>341</S>, which sought<S>1245</S> thy life<S>5315</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> hath<S>5414</S> avenged<S>5360</S> my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S> this day<S>3117</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, and of his seed<S>2233</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> answered<S>6030</S> Rechab<S>7394</S> and Baanah<S>1196</S> his brother<S>251</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S> the Beerothite<S>886</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, who hath redeemed<S>6299</S> my soul<S>5315</S> out of all adversity<S>6869</S>,
When one told<S>5046</S> me, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, Saul<S>7586</S> is dead<S>4191</S>, thinking to have brought<S>5869</S> good tidings<S>1319</S>, I took hold<S>270</S> of him, and slew<S>2026</S> him in Ziklag<S>6860</S>, who thought that I would have given<S>5414</S> him a reward for his tidings<S>1309</S>: <sup>thinking: Heb. he was in his own eyes as a bringer, etc</sup> <sup>who: or, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings</sup>
How much more, when wicked<S>7563</S> men<S>582</S> have slain<S>2026</S> a righteous<S>6662</S> person<S>376</S> in his own house<S>1004</S> upon his bed<S>4904</S>? shall I not therefore now require<S>1245</S> his blood<S>1818</S> of your hand<S>3027</S>, and take you away<S>1197</S> from the earth<S>776</S>?
And David<S>1732</S> commanded<S>6680</S> his young men<S>5288</S>, and they slew<S>2026</S> them, and cut off<S>7112</S> their hands<S>3027</S> and their feet<S>7272</S>, and hanged them up<S>8518</S> over the pool<S>1295</S> in Hebron<S>2275</S>. But they took<S>3947</S> the head<S>7218</S> of Ishbosheth<S>378</S>, and buried<S>6912</S> it in the sepulchre<S>6913</S> of Abner<S>74</S> in Hebron<S>2275</S>.

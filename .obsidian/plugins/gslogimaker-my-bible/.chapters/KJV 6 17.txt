There was also a lot<S>1486</S> for the tribe<S>4294</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>; for he was the firstborn<S>1060</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>; to wit, for Machir<S>4353</S> the firstborn<S>1060</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, the father<S>1</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>: because he was a man<S>376</S> of war<S>4421</S>, therefore he had Gilead<S>1568</S> and Bashan<S>1316</S>.
There was also a lot for the rest<S>3498</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> by their families<S>4940</S>; for the children<S>1121</S> of Abiezer<S>44</S>, and for the children<S>1121</S> of Helek<S>2507</S>, and for the children<S>1121</S> of Asriel<S>844</S>, and for the children<S>1121</S> of Shechem<S>7928</S>, and for the children<S>1121</S> of Hepher<S>2660</S>, and for the children<S>1121</S> of Shemida<S>8061</S>: these were the male<S>2145</S> children<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S> by their families<S>4940</S>.
But Zelophehad<S>6765</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Hepher<S>2660</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Machir<S>4353</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, had no sons<S>1121</S>, but daughters<S>1323</S>: and these are the names<S>8034</S> of his daughters<S>1323</S>, Mahlah<S>4244</S>, and Noah<S>5270</S>, Hoglah<S>2295</S>, Milcah<S>4435</S>, and Tirzah<S>8656</S>.
And they came near<S>7126</S> before<S>6440</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and before<S>6440</S> Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S>, and before<S>6440</S> the princes<S>5387</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S> to give<S>5414</S> us an inheritance<S>5159</S> among<S>8432</S> our brethren<S>251</S>. Therefore according to the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> he gave<S>5414</S> them an inheritance<S>5159</S> among<S>8432</S> the brethren<S>251</S> of their father<S>1</S>.
And there fell<S>5307</S> ten<S>6235</S> portions<S>2256</S> to Manasseh<S>4519</S>, beside the land<S>776</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S> and Bashan<S>1316</S>, which were on the other side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>;
Because the daughters<S>1323</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> had<S>5157</S> an inheritance<S>5159</S> among<S>8432</S> his sons<S>1121</S>: and the rest<S>3498</S> of Manasseh's<S>4519</S> sons<S>1121</S> had the land<S>776</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And the coast<S>1366</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> was from Asher<S>836</S> to Michmethah<S>4366</S>, that lieth before<S>6440</S> Shechem<S>7927</S>; and the border<S>1366</S> went along<S>1980</S> on the right hand<S>3225</S> unto the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Entappuah<S>5887</S>.
Now Manasseh<S>4519</S> had the land<S>776</S> of Tappuah<S>8599</S>: but Tappuah<S>8599</S> on the border<S>1366</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> belonged to the children<S>1121</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>;
And the coast<S>1366</S> descended<S>3381</S> unto the river<S>5158</S> Kanah<S>7071</S>, southward<S>5045</S> of the river<S>5158</S>: these cities<S>5892</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S> are among<S>8432</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>: the coast<S>1366</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> also was on the north side<S>6828</S> of the river<S>5158</S>, and the outgoings<S>8444</S> of it were at the sea<S>3220</S>: <sup>river Kanah: or, brook of reeds</sup>
Southward<S>5045</S> it was Ephraim's<S>669</S>, and northward<S>6828</S> it was Manasseh's<S>4519</S>, and the sea<S>3220</S> is his border<S>1366</S>; and they met together<S>6293</S> in Asher<S>836</S> on the north<S>6828</S>, and in Issachar<S>3485</S> on the east<S>4217</S>.
And Manasseh<S>4519</S> had in Issachar<S>3485</S> and in Asher<S>836</S> Bethshean<S>1052</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and Ibleam<S>2991</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Dor<S>1756</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Endor<S>5874</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Taanach<S>8590</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Megiddo<S>4023</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, even three<S>7969</S> countries<S>5316</S>.
Yet the children<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> could<S>3201</S> not drive out<S>3423</S> the inhabitants of those cities<S>5892</S>; but the Canaanites<S>3669</S> would<S>2974</S> dwell<S>3427</S> in that land<S>776</S>.
Yet it came to pass, when the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were waxen strong<S>2388</S>, that they put<S>5414</S> the Canaanites<S>3669</S> to tribute<S>4522</S>; but did not utterly<S>3423</S> drive them out<S>3423</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Why hast thou given<S>5414</S> me but one<S>259</S> lot<S>1486</S> and one<S>259</S> portion<S>2256</S> to inherit<S>5159</S>, seeing I am a great<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>, forasmuch as<S>5704</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> hath blessed<S>1288</S> me hitherto<S>3541</S>?
And Joshua<S>3091</S> answered<S>559</S> them, If thou be a great<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>, then get thee up<S>5927</S> to the wood<S>3293</S> country, and cut down<S>1254</S> for thyself there in the land<S>776</S> of the Perizzites<S>6522</S> and of the giants<S>7497</S>, if mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S> be too narrow<S>213</S> for thee. <sup>giants: or, Rephaims</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S>, The hill<S>2022</S> is not enough<S>4672</S> for us: and all the Canaanites<S>3669</S> that dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of the valley<S>6010</S> have chariots<S>7393</S> of iron<S>1270</S>, both they who are of Bethshean<S>1052</S> and her towns<S>1323</S>, and they who are of the valley<S>6010</S> of Jezreel<S>3157</S>.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> spake<S>559</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, even to Ephraim<S>669</S> and to Manasseh<S>4519</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thou art a great<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S>, and hast great<S>1419</S> power<S>3581</S>: thou shalt not have one<S>259</S> lot<S>1486</S> only:
But the mountain<S>2022</S> shall be thine; for it is a wood<S>3293</S>, and thou shalt cut it down<S>1254</S>: and the outgoings<S>8444</S> of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out<S>3423</S> the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, though they have iron<S>1270</S> chariots<S>7393</S>, and though they be strong<S>2389</S>.

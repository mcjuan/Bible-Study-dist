And in that day<S>3117</S> thou shalt say<S>559</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, I will praise<S>3034</S> thee: though thou wast angry<S>599</S> with me, thine anger<S>639</S> is turned away<S>7725</S>, and thou comfortedst<S>5162</S> me.
Behold, God<S>410</S> is my salvation<S>3444</S>; I will trust<S>982</S>, and not be afraid<S>6342</S>: for the LORD<S>3050</S> JEHOVAH<S>3068</S> is my strength<S>5797</S> and my song<S>2176</S>; he also is become my salvation<S>3444</S>.
Therefore with joy<S>8342</S> shall ye draw<S>7579</S> water<S>4325</S> out of the wells<S>4599</S> of salvation<S>3444</S>.
And in that day<S>3117</S> shall ye say<S>559</S>, Praise<S>3034</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, call<S>7121</S> upon his name<S>8034</S>, declare<S>3045</S> his doings<S>5949</S> among the people<S>5971</S>, make mention<S>2142</S> that his name<S>8034</S> is exalted<S>7682</S>. <sup>call: or, proclaim</sup>

Cry out<S>6670</S> and shout<S>7442</S>, thou inhabitant<S>3427</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>: for great<S>1419</S> is the Holy One<S>6918</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of thee. <sup>inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress</sup>

Now it came to pass, when Sanballat<S>5571</S>, and Tobiah<S>2900</S>, and Geshem<S>1654</S> the Arabian<S>6163</S>, and the rest<S>3499</S> of our enemies<S>341</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that I had builded<S>1129</S> the wall<S>2346</S>, and that there was no breach<S>6556</S> left<S>3498</S> therein; (though<S>1571</S> <S>5704</S> at that time<S>6256</S> I had not set up<S>5975</S> the doors<S>1817</S> upon the gates<S>8179</S>;)
That Sanballat<S>5571</S> and Geshem<S>1654</S> sent<S>7971</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>, Come<S>3212</S>, let us meet<S>3259</S> together<S>3162</S> in some one of the villages<S>3715</S> in the plain<S>1237</S> of Ono<S>207</S>. But they thought<S>2803</S> to do<S>6213</S> me mischief<S>7451</S>.
And I sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> unto them, saying<S>559</S>, I am doing<S>6213</S> a great<S>1419</S> work<S>4399</S>, so that I cannot<S>3201</S> come down<S>3381</S>: why should the work<S>4399</S> cease<S>7673</S>, whilst<S>834</S> I leave<S>7503</S> it, and come down<S>3381</S> to you?
Yet they sent<S>7971</S> unto me four<S>702</S> times<S>6471</S> after this sort<S>1697</S>; and I answered<S>7725</S> them after the same manner<S>1697</S>.
Then sent<S>7971</S> Sanballat<S>5571</S> his servant<S>5288</S> unto me in like manner<S>1697</S> the fifth<S>2549</S> time<S>6471</S> with an open<S>6605</S> letter<S>107</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>;
Wherein was written<S>3789</S>, It is reported<S>8085</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, and Gashmu<S>1654</S> saith<S>559</S> it, that thou and the Jews<S>3064</S> think<S>2803</S> to rebel<S>4775</S>: for which cause<S>3651</S> thou buildest<S>1129</S> the wall<S>2346</S>, that thou mayest be<S>1933</S> their king<S>4428</S>, according to these words<S>1697</S>. <sup>Gashmu: or, Geshem</sup>
And thou hast also appointed<S>5975</S> prophets<S>5030</S> to preach<S>7121</S> of thee at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, saying<S>559</S>, There is a king<S>4428</S> in Judah<S>3063</S>: and now shall it be reported<S>8085</S> to the king<S>4428</S> according to these words<S>1697</S>. Come<S>3212</S> now therefore, and let us take counsel<S>3289</S> together<S>3162</S>.
Then I sent<S>7971</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, There are<S>1961</S> no such things<S>1697</S> done<S>1961</S> as thou sayest<S>559</S>, but thou feignest<S>908</S> them out of thine own heart<S>3820</S>.
For they all made us afraid<S>3372</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Their hands<S>3027</S> shall be weakened<S>7503</S> from the work<S>4399</S>, that it be not done<S>6213</S>. Now therefore, O God, strengthen<S>2388</S> my hands<S>3027</S>.
Afterward I came<S>935</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of Shemaiah<S>8098</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Delaiah<S>1806</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Mehetabeel<S>4105</S>, who was shut up<S>6113</S>; and he said<S>559</S>, Let us meet together<S>3259</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, within<S>8432</S> the temple<S>1964</S>, and let us shut<S>5462</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the temple<S>1964</S>: for they will come<S>935</S> to slay<S>2026</S> thee; yea, in the night<S>3915</S> will they come<S>935</S> to slay<S>2026</S> thee.
And I said<S>559</S>, Should such<S>3644</S> a man<S>376</S> as I flee<S>1272</S>? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go<S>935</S> into the temple<S>1964</S> to save his life<S>2425</S>? I will not go in<S>935</S>.
And, lo, I perceived<S>5234</S> that God<S>430</S> had not sent<S>7971</S> him; but that he pronounced<S>1696</S> this prophecy<S>5016</S> against me: for Tobiah<S>2900</S> and Sanballat<S>5571</S> had hired<S>7936</S> him.
Therefore was he hired<S>7936</S>, that I should be afraid<S>3372</S>, and do so<S>6213</S>, and sin<S>2398</S>, and that they might have matter for an evil<S>7451</S> report<S>8034</S>, that they might reproach<S>2778</S> me.
My God<S>430</S>, think<S>2142</S> thou upon Tobiah<S>2900</S> and Sanballat<S>5571</S> according to these their works<S>4639</S>, and on the prophetess<S>5031</S> Noadiah<S>5129</S>, and the rest<S>3499</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S>, that would have put me in fear<S>3372</S>.
So the wall<S>2346</S> was finished<S>7999</S> in the twenty<S>6242</S> and fifth<S>2568</S> day of the month Elul<S>435</S>, in fifty<S>2572</S> and two<S>8147</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies<S>341</S> heard<S>8085</S> thereof, and all the heathen<S>1471</S> that were about us<S>5439</S> saw<S>7200</S> these things, they were much<S>3966</S> cast down<S>5307</S> in their own eyes<S>5869</S>: for they perceived<S>3045</S> that this work<S>4399</S> was wrought<S>6213</S> of our God<S>430</S>.
Moreover in those days<S>3117</S> the nobles<S>2715</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> sent<S>1980</S> many<S>7235</S> letters<S>107</S> unto Tobiah<S>2900</S>, and the letters of Tobiah<S>2900</S> came<S>935</S> unto them. <sup>sent: Heb. multiplied their letters passing to Tobiah</sup>
For there were many<S>7227</S> in Judah<S>3063</S> sworn<S>1167</S> <S>7621</S> unto him, because he was the son in law<S>2860</S> of Shechaniah<S>7935</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Arah<S>733</S>; and his son<S>1121</S> Johanan<S>3076</S> had taken<S>3947</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Meshullam<S>4918</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Berechiah<S>1296</S>.
Also they reported<S>559</S> his good deeds<S>2896</S> before<S>6440</S> me, and uttered<S>3318</S> my words<S>1697</S> to him. And Tobiah<S>2900</S> sent<S>7971</S> letters<S>107</S> to put me in fear<S>3372</S>. <sup>words: or, matters</sup>

And it came to pass after<S>310</S> these things<S>1697</S>, that one told<S>559</S> Joseph<S>3130</S>, Behold, thy father<S>1</S> is sick<S>2470</S>: and he took<S>3947</S> with him his two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S>, Manasseh<S>4519</S> and Ephraim<S>669</S>.
And one told<S>5046</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold, thy son<S>1121</S> Joseph<S>3130</S> cometh<S>935</S> unto thee: and Israel<S>3478</S> strengthened<S>2388</S> himself, and sat<S>3427</S> upon the bed<S>4296</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, God<S>410</S> Almighty<S>7706</S> appeared<S>7200</S> unto me at Luz<S>3870</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and blessed<S>1288</S> me,
And said<S>559</S> unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful<S>6509</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S> thee, and I will make<S>5414</S> of thee a multitude<S>6951</S> of people<S>5971</S>; and will give<S>5414</S> this land<S>776</S> to thy seed<S>2233</S> after thee<S>310</S> for an everlasting<S>5769</S> possession<S>272</S>.
And now thy two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S>, Ephraim<S>669</S> and Manasseh<S>4519</S>, which were born<S>3205</S> unto thee in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> before<S>5704</S> I came<S>935</S> unto thee into Egypt<S>4714</S>, are mine; as Reuben<S>7205</S> and Simeon<S>8095</S>, they shall be mine.
And thy issue<S>4138</S>, which thou begettest<S>3205</S> after<S>310</S> them, shall be thine, and shall be called<S>7121</S> after<S>5921</S> the name<S>8034</S> of their brethren<S>251</S> in their inheritance<S>5159</S>.
And as for me, when I came<S>935</S> from Padan<S>6307</S>, Rachel<S>7354</S> died<S>4191</S> by me in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, when<S>5750</S> yet there was but a little<S>3530</S> way<S>776</S> to come<S>935</S> unto Ephrath<S>672</S>: and I buried her<S>6912</S> there in the way<S>1870</S> of Ephrath<S>672</S>; the same is Bethlehem<S>1035</S>.
And Israel<S>3478</S> beheld<S>7200</S> Joseph's<S>3130</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Who are these?
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, They are my sons<S>1121</S>, whom God<S>430</S> hath given<S>5414</S> me in this place. And he said<S>559</S>, Bring them<S>3947</S>, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless<S>1288</S> them.
Now the eyes<S>5869</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were dim<S>3513</S> for age<S>2207</S>, so that he could<S>3201</S> not see<S>7200</S>. And he brought them near<S>5066</S> unto him; and he kissed<S>5401</S> them, and embraced<S>2263</S> them. <sup>dim: Heb. heavy</sup>
And Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, I had not thought<S>6419</S> to see<S>7200</S> thy face<S>6440</S>: and, lo, God<S>430</S> hath shewed<S>7200</S> me also thy seed<S>2233</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> brought them out<S>3318</S> from between<S>5973</S> his knees<S>1290</S>, and he bowed<S>7812</S> himself with his face<S>639</S> to the earth<S>776</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> took<S>3947</S> them both<S>8147</S>, Ephraim<S>669</S> in his right hand<S>3225</S> toward Israel's<S>3478</S> left hand<S>8040</S>, and Manasseh<S>4519</S> in his left hand<S>8040</S> toward Israel's<S>3478</S> right hand<S>3225</S>, and brought them near<S>5066</S> unto him.
And Israel<S>3478</S> stretched out<S>7971</S> his right hand<S>3225</S>, and laid<S>7896</S> it upon Ephraim's<S>669</S> head<S>7218</S>, who was the younger<S>6810</S>, and his left hand<S>8040</S> upon Manasseh's<S>4519</S> head<S>7218</S>, guiding<S>7919</S> his hands<S>3027</S> wittingly<S>7919</S>; for Manasseh<S>4519</S> was the firstborn<S>1060</S>.
And he blessed<S>1288</S> Joseph<S>3130</S>, and said<S>559</S>, God<S>430</S>, before<S>6440</S> whom my fathers<S>1</S> Abraham<S>85</S> and Isaac<S>3327</S> did walk<S>1980</S>, the God<S>430</S> which fed<S>7462</S> me all my life long<S>5750</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>,
The Angel<S>4397</S> which redeemed<S>1350</S> me from all evil<S>7451</S>, bless<S>1288</S> the lads<S>5288</S>; and let my name<S>8034</S> be named<S>7121</S> on them, and the name<S>8034</S> of my fathers<S>1</S> Abraham<S>85</S> and Isaac<S>3327</S>; and let them grow<S>1711</S> into a multitude<S>7230</S> in the midst<S>7130</S> of the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>grow: Heb. as fishes do increase</sup>
And when Joseph<S>3130</S> saw<S>7200</S> that his father<S>1</S> laid<S>7896</S> his right<S>3225</S> hand<S>3027</S> upon the head<S>7218</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, it displeased<S>3415</S> <S>5869</S> him: and he held up<S>8551</S> his father's<S>1</S> hand<S>3027</S>, to remove<S>5493</S> it from Ephraim's<S>669</S> head<S>7218</S> unto Manasseh's<S>4519</S> head<S>7218</S>. <sup>displeased: was evil in his eyes</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S>, Not so, my father<S>1</S>: for this is the firstborn<S>1060</S>; put<S>7760</S> thy right hand<S>3225</S> upon his head<S>7218</S>.
And his father<S>1</S> refused<S>3985</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I know<S>3045</S> it, my son<S>1121</S>, I know<S>3045</S> it: he also shall become a people<S>5971</S>, and he also shall be great<S>1431</S>: but truly<S>199</S> his younger<S>6996</S> brother<S>251</S> shall be greater<S>1431</S> than he, and his seed<S>2233</S> shall become a multitude<S>4393</S> of nations<S>1471</S>. <sup>multitude: Heb. fulness</sup>
And he blessed<S>1288</S> them that day<S>3117</S>, saying<S>559</S>, In thee shall Israel<S>3478</S> bless<S>1288</S>, saying<S>559</S>, God<S>430</S> make<S>7760</S> thee as Ephraim<S>669</S> and as Manasseh<S>4519</S>: and he set<S>7760</S> Ephraim<S>669</S> before<S>6440</S> Manasseh<S>4519</S>.
And Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, Behold, I die<S>4191</S>: but God<S>430</S> shall be with you, and bring you again<S>7725</S> unto the land<S>776</S> of your fathers<S>1</S>.
Moreover I have given<S>5414</S> to thee one<S>259</S> portion<S>7926</S> above thy brethren<S>251</S>, which I took<S>3947</S> out of the hand<S>3027</S> of the Amorite<S>567</S> with my sword<S>2719</S> and with my bow<S>7198</S>.

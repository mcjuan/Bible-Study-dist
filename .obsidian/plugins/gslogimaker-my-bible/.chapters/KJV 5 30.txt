And it shall come to pass, when all these things<S>1697</S> are come<S>935</S> upon thee, the blessing<S>1293</S> and the curse<S>7045</S>, which I have set<S>5414</S> before<S>6440</S> thee, and thou shalt call<S>7725</S> them to mind<S>3824</S> among all the nations<S>1471</S>, whither the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath driven<S>5080</S> thee,
And shalt return<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, and shalt obey<S>8085</S> his voice<S>6963</S> according to all that I command<S>6680</S> thee this day<S>3117</S>, thou and thy children<S>1121</S>, with all thine heart<S>3824</S>, and with all thy soul<S>5315</S>;
That then the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> will turn<S>7725</S> thy captivity<S>7622</S>, and have compassion<S>7355</S> upon thee, and will return<S>7725</S> and gather<S>6908</S> thee from all the nations<S>5971</S>, whither the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath scattered<S>6327</S> thee.
If any of thine be driven out<S>5080</S> unto the outmost<S>7097</S> parts of heaven<S>8064</S>, from thence will the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> gather<S>6908</S> thee, and from thence will he fetch<S>3947</S> thee:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> will bring<S>935</S> thee into the land<S>776</S> which thy fathers<S>1</S> possessed<S>3423</S>, and thou shalt possess<S>3423</S> it; and he will do thee good<S>3190</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S> thee above thy fathers<S>1</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> will circumcise<S>4135</S> thine heart<S>3824</S>, and the heart<S>3824</S> of thy seed<S>2233</S>, to love<S>157</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> with all thine heart<S>3824</S>, and with all thy soul<S>5315</S>, that thou mayest live<S>2416</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> will put<S>5414</S> all these curses<S>423</S> upon thine enemies<S>341</S>, and on them that hate<S>8130</S> thee, which persecuted<S>7291</S> thee.
And thou shalt return<S>7725</S> and obey<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and do<S>6213</S> all his commandments<S>4687</S> which I command<S>6680</S> thee this day<S>3117</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> will make thee plenteous<S>3498</S> in every work<S>4639</S> of thine hand<S>3027</S>, in the fruit<S>6529</S> of thy body<S>990</S>, and in the fruit<S>6529</S> of thy cattle<S>929</S>, and in the fruit<S>6529</S> of thy land<S>127</S>, for good<S>2896</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> will again<S>7725</S> rejoice<S>7797</S> over thee for good<S>2896</S>, as he rejoiced<S>7797</S> over thy fathers<S>1</S>:
If thou shalt hearken<S>8085</S> unto the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, to keep<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S> and his statutes<S>2708</S> which are written<S>3789</S> in this book<S>5612</S> of the law<S>8451</S>, and if thou turn<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> with all thine heart<S>3824</S>, and with all thy soul<S>5315</S>.
For this commandment<S>4687</S> which I command<S>6680</S> thee this day<S>3117</S>, it is not hidden<S>6381</S> from thee, neither is it far off<S>7350</S>.
It is not in heaven<S>8064</S>, that thou shouldest say<S>559</S>, Who shall go up<S>5927</S> for us to heaven<S>8064</S>, and bring<S>3947</S> it unto us, that we may hear<S>8085</S> it, and do<S>6213</S> it?
Neither is it beyond<S>5676</S> the sea<S>3220</S>, that thou shouldest say<S>559</S>, Who shall go<S>5674</S> over<S>5676</S> the sea<S>3220</S> for us, and bring<S>3947</S> it unto us, that we may hear<S>8085</S> it, and do<S>6213</S> it?
But the word<S>1697</S> is very<S>3966</S> nigh<S>7138</S> unto thee, in thy mouth<S>6310</S>, and in thy heart<S>3824</S>, that thou mayest do<S>6213</S> it.
See<S>7200</S>, I have set<S>5414</S> before<S>6440</S> thee this day<S>3117</S> life<S>2416</S> and good<S>2896</S>, and death<S>4194</S> and evil<S>7451</S>;
In that I command<S>6680</S> thee this day<S>3117</S> to love<S>157</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, to walk<S>3212</S> in his ways<S>1870</S>, and to keep<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S> and his statutes<S>2708</S> and his judgments<S>4941</S>, that thou mayest live<S>2421</S> and multiply<S>7235</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> shall bless<S>1288</S> thee in the land<S>776</S> whither thou goest<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it.
But if thine heart<S>3824</S> turn away<S>6437</S>, so that thou wilt not hear<S>8085</S>, but shalt be drawn away<S>5080</S>, and worship<S>7812</S> other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> them;
I denounce<S>5046</S> unto you this day<S>3117</S>, that ye shall surely<S>6</S> perish<S>6</S>, and that ye shall not prolong<S>748</S> your days<S>3117</S> upon the land<S>127</S>, whither thou passest over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> to go<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it.
I call<S>5749</S> heaven<S>8064</S> and earth<S>776</S> to record<S>5749</S> this day<S>3117</S> against you, that I have set<S>5414</S> before<S>6440</S> you life<S>2416</S> and death<S>4194</S>, blessing<S>1293</S> and cursing<S>7045</S>: therefore choose<S>977</S> life<S>2416</S>, that both thou and thy seed<S>2233</S> may live<S>2421</S>:
That thou mayest love<S>157</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, and that thou mayest obey<S>8085</S> his voice<S>6963</S>, and that thou mayest cleave<S>1692</S> unto him: for he is thy life<S>2416</S>, and the length<S>753</S> of thy days<S>3117</S>: that thou mayest dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>127</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto thy fathers<S>1</S>, to Abraham<S>85</S>, to Isaac<S>3327</S>, and to Jacob<S>3290</S>, to give<S>5414</S> them.

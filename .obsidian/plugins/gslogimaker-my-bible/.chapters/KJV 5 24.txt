When a man<S>376</S> hath taken<S>3947</S> a wife<S>802</S>, and married<S>1166</S> her, and it come to pass that she find<S>4672</S> no favour<S>2580</S> in his eyes<S>5869</S>, because he hath found<S>4672</S> some<S>1697</S> uncleanness<S>6172</S> in her: then let him write<S>3789</S> her a bill<S>5612</S> of divorcement<S>3748</S>, and give<S>5414</S> it in her hand<S>3027</S>, and send<S>7971</S> her out of his house<S>1004</S>. <sup>some: Heb. matter of nakedness</sup> <sup>divorcement: Heb. cutting off</sup>
And when she is departed out<S>3318</S> of his house<S>1004</S>, she may go<S>1980</S> and be another<S>312</S> man's<S>376</S> wife.
And if the latter<S>314</S> husband<S>376</S> hate<S>8130</S> her, and write<S>3789</S> her a bill<S>5612</S> of divorcement<S>3748</S>, and giveth<S>5414</S> it in her hand<S>3027</S>, and sendeth<S>7971</S> her out of his house<S>1004</S>; or if the latter<S>314</S> husband<S>376</S> die<S>4191</S>, which took<S>3947</S> her to be his wife<S>802</S>;
Her former<S>7223</S> husband<S>1167</S>, which sent her away<S>7971</S>, may<S>3201</S> not take<S>3947</S> her again<S>7725</S> to be his wife<S>802</S>, after<S>310</S> that she is defiled<S>2930</S>; for that is abomination<S>8441</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and thou shalt not cause the land<S>776</S> to sin<S>2398</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee for an inheritance<S>5159</S>.
When a man<S>376</S> hath taken<S>3947</S> a new<S>2319</S> wife<S>802</S>, he shall not go out<S>3318</S> to war<S>6635</S>, neither shall he be charged<S>5674</S> with any business<S>1697</S>: but he shall be free<S>5355</S> at home<S>1004</S> one<S>259</S> year<S>8141</S>, and shall cheer up<S>8055</S> his wife<S>802</S> which he hath taken<S>3947</S>. <sup>neither: Heb. not any thing shall pass upon him</sup>
No man shall take<S>2254</S> the nether<S>7347</S> or the upper millstone<S>7393</S> to pledge<S>2254</S>: for he taketh<S>2254</S> a man's life<S>5315</S> to pledge<S>2254</S>.
If a man<S>376</S> be found<S>4672</S> stealing<S>1589</S> any<S>5315</S> of his brethren<S>251</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and maketh merchandise<S>6014</S> of him, or selleth<S>4376</S> him; then that thief<S>1590</S> shall die<S>4191</S>; and thou shalt put<S>1197</S> evil<S>7451</S> away<S>1197</S> from among<S>7130</S> you.
Take heed<S>8104</S> in the plague<S>5061</S> of leprosy<S>6883</S>, that thou observe<S>8104</S> diligently<S>3966</S>, and do<S>6213</S> according to all that the priests<S>3548</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> shall teach<S>3384</S> you: as I commanded<S>6680</S> them, so ye shall observe<S>8104</S> to do<S>6213</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> what the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> did<S>6213</S> unto Miriam<S>4813</S> by the way<S>1870</S>, after that ye were come forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
When thou dost lend<S>5383</S> thy brother<S>7453</S> any<S>3972</S> thing<S>4859</S>, thou shalt not go<S>935</S> into his house<S>1004</S> to fetch<S>5670</S> his pledge<S>5667</S>. <sup>lend: Heb. lend the loan of any thing to, etc</sup>
Thou shalt stand<S>5975</S> abroad<S>2351</S>, and the man<S>376</S> to whom thou dost lend<S>5383</S> shall bring out<S>3318</S> the pledge<S>5667</S> abroad<S>2351</S> unto thee.
And if the man<S>376</S> be poor<S>6041</S>, thou shalt not sleep<S>7901</S> with his pledge<S>5667</S>:
In any case<S>7725</S> thou shalt deliver<S>7725</S> him the pledge<S>5667</S> again<S>7725</S> when the sun<S>8121</S> goeth down<S>935</S>, that he may sleep<S>7901</S> in his own raiment<S>8008</S>, and bless<S>1288</S> thee: and it shall be righteousness<S>6666</S> unto thee before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>.
Thou shalt not oppress<S>6231</S> an hired servant<S>7916</S> that is poor<S>6041</S> and needy<S>34</S>, whether he be of thy brethren<S>251</S>, or of thy strangers<S>1616</S> that are in thy land<S>776</S> within thy gates<S>8179</S>:
At his day<S>3117</S> thou shalt give<S>5414</S> him his hire<S>7939</S>, neither shall the sun<S>8121</S> go down<S>935</S> upon it; for he is poor<S>6041</S>, and setteth<S>5375</S> his heart<S>5315</S> upon it: lest he cry<S>7121</S> against thee unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and it be sin<S>2399</S> unto thee. <sup>setteth: Heb. lifteth his soul unto it</sup>
The fathers<S>1</S> shall not be put to death<S>4191</S> for the children<S>1121</S>, neither shall the children<S>1121</S> be put to death<S>4191</S> for the fathers<S>1</S>: every man<S>376</S> shall be put to death<S>4191</S> for his own sin<S>2399</S>.
Thou shalt not pervert<S>5186</S> the judgment<S>4941</S> of the stranger<S>1616</S>, nor of the fatherless<S>3490</S>; nor take<S>2254</S> a widow's<S>490</S> raiment<S>899</S> to pledge<S>2254</S>:
But thou shalt remember<S>2142</S> that thou wast a bondman<S>5650</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> redeemed<S>6299</S> thee thence: therefore I command<S>6680</S> thee to do<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S>.
When thou cuttest down<S>7114</S> thine harvest<S>7105</S> in thy field<S>7704</S>, and hast forgot<S>7911</S> a sheaf<S>6016</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, thou shalt not go again<S>7725</S> to fetch<S>3947</S> it: it shall be for the stranger<S>1616</S>, for the fatherless<S>3490</S>, and for the widow<S>490</S>: that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> may bless<S>1288</S> thee in all the work<S>4639</S> of thine hands<S>3027</S>.
When thou beatest<S>2251</S> thine olive tree<S>2132</S>, thou shalt not go over the boughs<S>6286</S> again<S>310</S>: it shall be for the stranger<S>1616</S>, for the fatherless<S>3490</S>, and for the widow<S>490</S>. <sup>go: Heb. bough it after thee</sup>

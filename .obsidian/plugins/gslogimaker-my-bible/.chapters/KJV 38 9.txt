The burden<S>4853</S> of the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Hadrach<S>2317</S>, and Damascus<S>1834</S> shall be the rest<S>4496</S> thereof: when the eyes<S>5869</S> of man<S>120</S>, as of all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, shall be toward the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Hamath<S>2574</S> also shall border<S>1379</S> thereby; Tyrus<S>6865</S>, and Zidon<S>6721</S>, though it be very<S>3966</S> wise<S>2449</S>.
And Tyrus<S>6865</S> did build<S>1129</S> herself a strong hold<S>4692</S>, and heaped up<S>6651</S> silver<S>3701</S> as the dust<S>6083</S>, and fine gold<S>2742</S> as the mire<S>2916</S> of the streets<S>2351</S>.
Behold, the Lord<S>136</S> will cast her out<S>3423</S>, and he will smite<S>5221</S> her power<S>2428</S> in the sea<S>3220</S>; and she shall be devoured<S>398</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
Ashkelon<S>831</S> shall see<S>7200</S> it, and fear<S>3372</S>; Gaza<S>5804</S> also shall see it, and be very<S>3966</S> sorrowful<S>2342</S>, and Ekron<S>6138</S>; for her expectation<S>4007</S> shall be ashamed<S>3001</S>; and the king<S>4428</S> shall perish<S>6</S> from Gaza<S>5804</S>, and Ashkelon<S>831</S> shall not be inhabited<S>3427</S>.
And a bastard<S>4464</S> shall dwell<S>3427</S> in Ashdod<S>795</S>, and I will cut off<S>3772</S> the pride<S>1347</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>.
And I will take away<S>5493</S> his blood<S>1818</S> out of his mouth<S>6310</S>, and his abominations<S>8251</S> from between his teeth<S>8127</S>: but he that remaineth<S>7604</S>, even he, shall be for our God<S>430</S>, and he shall be as a governor<S>441</S> in Judah<S>3063</S>, and Ekron<S>6138</S> as a Jebusite<S>2983</S>. <sup>blood: Heb. bloods</sup>
And I will encamp<S>2583</S> about mine house<S>1004</S> because of the army<S>4675</S>, because of him that passeth by<S>5674</S>, and because of him that returneth<S>7725</S>: and no oppressor<S>5065</S> shall pass through<S>5674</S> them any more: for now have I seen<S>7200</S> with mine eyes<S>5869</S>.
Rejoice<S>1523</S> greatly<S>3966</S>, O daughter<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>; shout<S>7321</S>, O daughter<S>1323</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: behold, thy King<S>4428</S> cometh<S>935</S> unto thee: he is just<S>6662</S>, and having salvation<S>3467</S>; lowly<S>6041</S>, and riding<S>7392</S> upon an ass<S>2543</S>, and upon a colt<S>5895</S> the foal<S>1121</S> of an ass<S>860</S>. <sup>having: or, saving himself</sup>
And I will cut off<S>3772</S> the chariot<S>7393</S> from Ephraim<S>669</S>, and the horse<S>5483</S> from Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and the battle<S>4421</S> bow<S>7198</S> shall be cut off<S>3772</S>: and he shall speak<S>1696</S> peace<S>7965</S> unto the heathen<S>1471</S>: and his dominion<S>4915</S> shall be from sea<S>3220</S> even to sea<S>3220</S>, and from the river<S>5104</S> even to the ends<S>657</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
As for thee also, by the blood<S>1818</S> of thy covenant<S>1285</S> I have sent forth<S>7971</S> thy prisoners<S>615</S> out of the pit<S>953</S> wherein is no water<S>4325</S>. <sup>by: or, whose covenant is by blood</sup>
Turn<S>7725</S> you to the strong hold<S>1225</S>, ye prisoners<S>615</S> of hope<S>8615</S>: even to day<S>3117</S> do I declare<S>5046</S> that I will render<S>7725</S> double<S>4932</S> unto thee;
When I have bent<S>1869</S> Judah<S>3063</S> for me, filled<S>4390</S> the bow<S>7198</S> with Ephraim<S>669</S>, and raised up<S>5782</S> thy sons<S>1121</S>, O Zion<S>6726</S>, against thy sons<S>1121</S>, O Greece<S>3120</S>, and made<S>7760</S> thee as the sword<S>2719</S> of a mighty man<S>1368</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> shall be seen<S>7200</S> over them, and his arrow<S>2671</S> shall go forth<S>3318</S> as the lightning<S>1300</S>: and the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> shall blow<S>8628</S> the trumpet<S>7782</S>, and shall go<S>1980</S> with whirlwinds<S>5591</S> of the south<S>8486</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> shall defend<S>1598</S> them; and they shall devour<S>398</S>, and subdue<S>3533</S> with sling<S>7050</S> stones<S>68</S>; and they shall drink<S>8354</S>, and make a noise<S>1993</S> as through wine<S>3196</S>; and they shall be filled<S>4390</S> like bowls<S>4219</S>, and as the corners<S>2106</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>. <sup>with: or, the stones of the sling</sup> <sup>be: or, fill both the bowls, etc</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S> shall save<S>3467</S> them in that day<S>3117</S> as the flock<S>6629</S> of his people<S>5971</S>: for they shall be as the stones<S>68</S> of a crown<S>5145</S>, lifted up as an ensign<S>5264</S> upon his land<S>127</S>.
For how great is his goodness<S>2898</S>, and how great is his beauty<S>3308</S>! corn<S>1715</S> shall make the young men<S>970</S> cheerful<S>5107</S>, and new wine<S>8492</S> the maids<S>1330</S>. <sup>cheerful: or, grow, or, speak</sup>

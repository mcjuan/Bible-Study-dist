And David<S>1732</S> numbered<S>6485</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were with him, and set<S>7760</S> captains<S>8269</S> of thousands<S>505</S> and captains<S>8269</S> of hundreds<S>3967</S> over them.
And David<S>1732</S> sent forth<S>7971</S> a third part<S>7992</S> of the people<S>5971</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Joab<S>3097</S>, and a third part<S>7992</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Abishai<S>52</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zeruiah<S>6870</S>, Joab's<S>3097</S> brother<S>251</S>, and a third part<S>7992</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Ittai<S>863</S> the Gittite<S>1663</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, I will surely<S>3318</S> go forth<S>3318</S> with you myself<S>589</S> also.
But the people<S>5971</S> answered<S>559</S>, Thou shalt not go forth<S>3318</S>: for if we flee<S>5127</S> away<S>5127</S>, they will not care<S>7760</S> <S>3820</S> for us; neither if half<S>2677</S> of us die<S>4191</S>, will they care<S>7760</S> <S>3820</S> for us: but now thou art worth<S>3644</S> ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> of us: therefore now it is better<S>2896</S> that thou succour<S>5826</S> <S>5826</S> us out of the city<S>5892</S>. <sup>care: Heb. set their heart on us</sup> <sup>worth: Heb. as ten thousand of us</sup> <sup>succour: Heb. be to succour or help</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, What seemeth<S>5869</S> you best<S>3190</S> I will do<S>6213</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> stood<S>5975</S> by the gate<S>8179</S> side<S>3027</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S> came out<S>3318</S> by hundreds<S>3967</S> and by thousands<S>505</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Joab<S>3097</S> and Abishai<S>52</S> and Ittai<S>863</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Deal gently<S>328</S> for my sake with the young man<S>5288</S>, even with Absalom<S>53</S>. And all the people<S>5971</S> heard<S>8085</S> when the king<S>4428</S> gave all the captains<S>8269</S> charge<S>6680</S> concerning<S>1697</S> Absalom<S>53</S>.
So the people<S>5971</S> went out<S>3318</S> into the field<S>7704</S> against<S>7125</S> Israel<S>3478</S>: and the battle<S>4421</S> was in the wood<S>3293</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>;
Where the people<S>5971</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were slain<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> the servants<S>5650</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and there was there a great<S>1419</S> slaughter<S>4046</S> that day<S>3117</S> of twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> men.
For the battle<S>4421</S> was there scattered<S>6327</S> over the face<S>6440</S> of all the country<S>776</S>: and the wood<S>3293</S> devoured<S>398</S> more<S>7235</S> people<S>5971</S> that day<S>3117</S> than the sword<S>2719</S> devoured<S>398</S>. <sup>devoured: Heb. multiplied to devour</sup>
And Absalom<S>53</S> met<S>7122</S> the servants<S>6440</S> <S>5650</S> of David<S>1732</S>. And Absalom<S>53</S> rode<S>7392</S> upon a mule<S>6505</S>, and the mule<S>6505</S> went<S>935</S> under the thick boughs<S>7730</S> of a great<S>1419</S> oak<S>424</S>, and his head<S>7218</S> caught hold<S>2388</S> of the oak<S>424</S>, and he was taken up<S>5414</S> between the heaven<S>8064</S> and the earth<S>776</S>; and the mule<S>6505</S> that was under him went away<S>5674</S>.
And a certain<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> saw<S>7200</S> it, and told<S>5046</S> Joab<S>3097</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold, I saw<S>7200</S> Absalom<S>53</S> hanged<S>8518</S> in an oak<S>424</S>.
And Joab<S>3097</S> said<S>559</S> unto the man<S>376</S> that told<S>5046</S> him, And, behold, thou sawest<S>7200</S> him, and why didst thou not smite<S>5221</S> him there to the ground<S>776</S>? and I would have given<S>5414</S> thee ten<S>6235</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S>, and a<S>259</S> girdle<S>2290</S>.
And the man<S>376</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joab<S>3097</S>, Though<S>3863</S> I should receive<S>8254</S> a thousand<S>505</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S> in mine hand<S>3709</S>, yet would I not put forth<S>7971</S> mine hand<S>3027</S> against the king's<S>4428</S> son<S>1121</S>: for in our hearing<S>241</S> the king<S>4428</S> charged<S>6680</S> thee and Abishai<S>52</S> and Ittai<S>863</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Beware<S>8104</S> that none touch the young man<S>5288</S> Absalom<S>53</S>. <sup>receive: Heb. weigh upon mine hand</sup> <sup>Beware: Heb. Beware whosoever ye be of, etc</sup>
Otherwise<S>176</S> I should have wrought<S>6213</S> falsehood<S>8267</S> against mine own life<S>5315</S>: for there is no matter<S>1697</S> hid<S>3582</S> from the king<S>4428</S>, and thou thyself wouldest have set<S>3320</S> thyself against me.
Then said<S>559</S> Joab<S>3097</S>, I may not tarry<S>3176</S> thus with thee<S>6440</S>. And he took<S>3947</S> three<S>7969</S> darts<S>7626</S> in his hand<S>3709</S>, and thrust<S>8628</S> them through the heart<S>3820</S> of Absalom<S>53</S>, while he was yet alive<S>2416</S> in the midst of the oak<S>424</S>. <sup>with: Heb. before thee</sup> <sup>midst: Heb. heart</sup>
And ten<S>6235</S> young men<S>5288</S> that bare<S>5375</S> Joab's<S>3097</S> armour<S>3627</S> compassed about<S>5437</S> and smote<S>5221</S> Absalom<S>53</S>, and slew<S>4191</S> him.
And Joab<S>3097</S> blew<S>8628</S> the trumpet<S>7782</S>, and the people<S>5971</S> returned<S>7725</S> from pursuing<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> Israel<S>3478</S>: for Joab<S>3097</S> held back<S>2820</S> the people<S>5971</S>.
And they took<S>3947</S> Absalom<S>53</S>, and cast<S>7993</S> him into a great<S>1419</S> pit<S>6354</S> in the wood<S>3293</S>, and laid<S>5324</S> a very<S>3966</S> great<S>1419</S> heap<S>1530</S> of stones<S>68</S> upon him: and all Israel<S>3478</S> fled<S>5127</S> every one<S>376</S> to his tent<S>168</S>.
Now Absalom<S>53</S> in his lifetime<S>2416</S> had taken<S>3947</S> and reared up<S>5324</S> for himself a pillar<S>4678</S>, which is in the king's<S>4428</S> dale<S>6010</S>: for he said<S>559</S>, I have no son<S>1121</S> to keep my name<S>8034</S> in remembrance<S>2142</S>: and he called<S>7121</S> the pillar<S>4678</S> after his own name<S>8034</S>: and it is called<S>7121</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>, Absalom's<S>53</S> place<S>3027</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Ahimaaz<S>290</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S>, Let me now run<S>7323</S>, and bear<S>1319</S> the king<S>4428</S> tidings<S>1319</S>, how that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath avenged<S>8199</S> him of his enemies<S>3027</S> <S>341</S>. <sup>avenged: Heb. judged him from the hand, etc</sup>
And Joab<S>3097</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Thou<S>376</S> shalt not bear tidings<S>1309</S> this day<S>3117</S>, but thou shalt bear tidings<S>1319</S> another<S>312</S> day<S>3117</S>: but this day<S>3117</S> thou shalt bear no tidings<S>1319</S>, because the king's<S>4428</S> son<S>1121</S> is dead<S>4191</S>. <sup>bear tidings this: Heb. be a man of tidings, etc</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Joab<S>3097</S> to Cushi<S>3569</S>, Go<S>3212</S> tell<S>5046</S> the king<S>4428</S> what thou hast seen<S>7200</S>. And Cushi<S>3569</S> bowed<S>7812</S> himself unto Joab<S>3097</S>, and ran<S>7323</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Ahimaaz<S>290</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S> yet again<S>3254</S> to Joab<S>3097</S>, But howsoever<S>4100</S>, let me, I pray thee, also run<S>7323</S> after<S>310</S> Cushi<S>3569</S>. And Joab<S>3097</S> said<S>559</S>, Wherefore wilt thou run<S>7323</S>, my son<S>1121</S>, seeing that thou hast no tidings<S>1309</S> ready<S>4672</S>? <sup>howsoever: Heb. be what may</sup> <sup>ready: or, convenient</sup>
But howsoever, said he, let me run<S>7323</S>. And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Run<S>7323</S>. Then Ahimaaz<S>290</S> ran<S>7323</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the plain<S>3603</S>, and overran<S>5674</S> Cushi<S>3569</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> sat<S>3427</S> between the two<S>8147</S> gates<S>8179</S>: and the watchman<S>6822</S> went up<S>3212</S> to the roof<S>1406</S> over the gate<S>8179</S> unto the wall<S>2346</S>, and lifted up<S>5375</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>, and looked<S>7200</S>, and behold a man<S>376</S> running<S>7323</S> alone.
And the watchman<S>6822</S> cried<S>7121</S>, and told<S>5046</S> the king<S>4428</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, If he be alone, there is tidings<S>1309</S> in his mouth<S>6310</S>. And he came<S>3212</S> apace<S>1980</S>, and drew near<S>7131</S>.
And the watchman<S>6822</S> saw<S>7200</S> another<S>312</S> man<S>376</S> running<S>7323</S>: and the watchman<S>6822</S> called<S>7121</S> unto the porter<S>7778</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold another man<S>376</S> running<S>7323</S> alone. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, He also bringeth tidings<S>1319</S>.
And the watchman<S>6822</S> said<S>559</S>, Me thinketh<S>7200</S> the running<S>4794</S> of the foremost<S>7223</S> is like the running<S>4794</S> of Ahimaaz<S>290</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, He is a good<S>2896</S> man<S>376</S>, and cometh<S>935</S> with good<S>2896</S> tidings<S>1309</S>. <sup>Me: Heb. I see the running</sup>
And Ahimaaz<S>290</S> called<S>7121</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, All is well<S>7965</S>. And he fell down<S>7812</S> to the earth<S>776</S> upon his face<S>639</S> before the king<S>4428</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>, which hath delivered up<S>5462</S> the men<S>582</S> that lifted up<S>5375</S> their hand<S>3027</S> against my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>. <sup>All: or, Peace be to thee: Heb.

And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Is the young man<S>5288</S> Absalom<S>53</S> safe<S>7965</S>? And Ahimaaz<S>290</S> answered<S>559</S>, When Joab<S>3097</S> sent<S>7971</S> the king's<S>4428</S> servant<S>5650</S>, and me thy servant<S>5650</S>, I saw<S>7200</S> a great<S>1419</S> tumult<S>1995</S>, but I knew<S>3045</S> not what it was. <sup>Is: Heb.

And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Turn aside<S>5437</S>, and stand<S>3320</S> here<S>3541</S>. And he turned aside<S>5437</S>, and stood still<S>5975</S>.
And, behold, Cushi<S>3569</S> came<S>935</S>; and Cushi<S>3569</S> said<S>559</S>, Tidings<S>1319</S>, my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath avenged<S>8199</S> thee this day<S>3117</S> of all them<S>3027</S> that rose up<S>6965</S> against thee. <sup>Tidings: Heb.

And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto Cushi<S>3569</S>, Is the young man<S>5288</S> Absalom<S>53</S> safe<S>7965</S>? And Cushi<S>3569</S> answered<S>559</S>, The enemies<S>341</S> of my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and all that rise<S>6965</S> against thee to do thee hurt<S>7451</S>, be as that young man<S>5288</S> is.
And the king<S>4428</S> was much moved<S>7264</S>, and went up<S>5927</S> to the chamber<S>5944</S> over the gate<S>8179</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>: and as he went<S>3212</S>, thus he said<S>559</S>, O my son<S>1121</S> Absalom<S>53</S>, my son<S>1121</S>, my son<S>1121</S> Absalom<S>53</S>! would God I had died<S>4191</S> for thee<S>5414</S>, O Absalom<S>53</S>, my son<S>1121</S>, my son<S>1121</S>!

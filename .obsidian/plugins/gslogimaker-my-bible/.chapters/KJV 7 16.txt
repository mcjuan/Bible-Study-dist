Then went<S>3212</S> Samson<S>8123</S> to Gaza<S>5804</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> there an harlot<S>802</S> <S>2181</S>, and went in<S>935</S> unto her. <sup>harlot: Heb. a woman an harlot</sup>
And it was told the Gazites<S>5841</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Samson<S>8123</S> is come<S>935</S> hither. And they compassed him in<S>5437</S>, and laid wait<S>693</S> for him all night<S>3915</S> in the gate<S>8179</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and were quiet<S>2790</S> all the night<S>3915</S>, saying<S>559</S>, In the morning<S>1242</S>, when it is day<S>216</S>, we shall kill<S>2026</S> him. <sup>quiet: Heb. silent</sup>
And Samson<S>8123</S> lay<S>7901</S> till midnight<S>2677</S> <S>3915</S>, and arose<S>6965</S> at midnight<S>2677</S> <S>3915</S>, and took<S>270</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and the two<S>8147</S> posts<S>4201</S>, and went away<S>5265</S> with them, bar<S>1280</S> and all, and put<S>7760</S> them upon his shoulders<S>3802</S>, and carried them up<S>5927</S> to the top<S>7218</S> of an hill<S>2022</S> that is before<S>6440</S> Hebron<S>2275</S>. <sup>bar: Heb. with the bar</sup>
And it came to pass afterward<S>310</S>, that he loved<S>157</S> a woman<S>802</S> in the valley<S>5158</S> of Sorek<S>7796</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Delilah<S>1807</S>. <sup>in: or, by the brook</sup>
And the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> came up<S>5927</S> unto her, and said<S>559</S> unto her, Entice<S>6601</S> him, and see<S>7200</S> wherein his great<S>1419</S> strength<S>3581</S> lieth, and by what means we may prevail<S>3201</S> against him, that we may bind<S>631</S> him to afflict<S>6031</S> him: and we will give<S>5414</S> thee every one<S>376</S> of us eleven hundred<S>505</S> <S>3967</S> pieces of silver<S>3701</S>. <sup>afflict: or, humble</sup>
And Delilah<S>1807</S> said<S>559</S> to Samson<S>8123</S>, Tell<S>5046</S> me, I pray thee, wherein thy great<S>1419</S> strength<S>3581</S> lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound<S>631</S> to afflict<S>6031</S> thee.
And Samson<S>8123</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, If they bind<S>631</S> me with seven<S>7651</S> green<S>3892</S> withs<S>3499</S> that were never dried<S>2717</S>, then shall I be weak<S>2470</S>, and be as another<S>259</S> man<S>120</S>. <sup>green: or, new cords: Heb. moist</sup> <sup>another: Heb. one</sup>
Then the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> brought up<S>5927</S> to her seven<S>7651</S> green<S>3892</S> withs<S>3499</S> which had not been dried<S>2717</S>, and she bound<S>631</S> him with them. <sup>green: or, new cords: Heb. moist</sup>
Now there were men lying in wait<S>693</S>, abiding<S>3427</S> with her in the chamber<S>2315</S>. And she said<S>559</S> unto him, The Philistines<S>6430</S> be upon thee, Samson<S>8123</S>. And he brake<S>5423</S> the withs<S>3499</S>, as a thread<S>6616</S> of tow<S>5296</S> is broken<S>5423</S> when it toucheth<S>7306</S> the fire<S>784</S>. So his strength<S>3581</S> was not known<S>3045</S>. <sup>toucheth: Heb. smelleth</sup>
And Delilah<S>1807</S> said<S>559</S> unto Samson<S>8123</S>, Behold, thou hast mocked<S>2048</S> me, and told<S>1696</S> me lies<S>3577</S>: now tell<S>5046</S> me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound<S>631</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto her, If they bind<S>631</S> me fast<S>631</S> with new<S>2319</S> ropes<S>5688</S> that never were occupied<S>4399</S> <S>6213</S>, then shall I be weak<S>2470</S>, and be as another<S>259</S> man<S>120</S>. <sup>that never: Heb. wherewith work hath not been done</sup>
Delilah<S>1807</S> therefore took<S>3947</S> new<S>2319</S> ropes<S>5688</S>, and bound<S>631</S> him therewith, and said<S>559</S> unto him, The Philistines<S>6430</S> be upon thee, Samson<S>8123</S>. And there were liers in wait<S>693</S> abiding<S>3427</S> in the chamber<S>2315</S>. And he brake<S>5423</S> them from off his arms<S>2220</S> like a thread<S>2339</S>.
And Delilah<S>1807</S> said<S>559</S> unto Samson<S>8123</S>, Hitherto<S>2008</S> thou hast mocked<S>2048</S> me, and told<S>1696</S> me lies<S>3577</S>: tell<S>5046</S> me wherewith thou mightest be bound<S>631</S>. And he said<S>559</S> unto her, If thou weavest<S>707</S> the seven<S>7651</S> locks<S>4253</S> of my head<S>7218</S> with the web<S>4545</S>.
And she fastened<S>8628</S> it with the pin<S>3489</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, The Philistines<S>6430</S> be upon thee, Samson<S>8123</S>. And he awaked<S>3364</S> out of his sleep<S>8142</S>, and went away<S>5265</S> with the pin<S>3489</S> of the beam<S>708</S>, and with the web<S>4545</S>.
And she said<S>559</S> unto him, How<S>349</S> canst thou say<S>559</S>, I love<S>157</S> thee, when thine heart<S>3820</S> is not with me? thou hast mocked<S>2048</S> me these three<S>7969</S> times<S>6471</S>, and hast not told<S>5046</S> me wherein thy great<S>1419</S> strength<S>3581</S> lieth.
And it came to pass, when she pressed<S>6693</S> him daily<S>3117</S> with her words<S>1697</S>, and urged<S>509</S> him, so that his soul<S>5315</S> was vexed<S>7114</S> unto death<S>4191</S>; <sup>vexed: Heb. shortened</sup>
That he told<S>5046</S> her all his heart<S>3820</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto her, There hath not come<S>5927</S> a razor<S>4177</S> upon mine head<S>7218</S>; for I have been a Nazarite<S>5139</S> unto God<S>430</S> from my mother's<S>517</S> womb<S>990</S>: if I be shaven<S>1548</S>, then my strength<S>3581</S> will go<S>5493</S> from me, and I shall become weak<S>2470</S>, and be like any other man<S>120</S>.
And when Delilah<S>1807</S> saw<S>7200</S> that he had told<S>5046</S> her all his heart<S>3820</S>, she sent<S>7971</S> and called<S>7121</S> for the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Come up<S>5927</S> this once<S>6471</S>, for he hath shewed<S>5046</S> me all his heart<S>3820</S>. Then the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> came up<S>5927</S> unto her, and brought<S>5927</S> money<S>3701</S> in their hand<S>3027</S>.
And she made him sleep<S>3462</S> upon her knees<S>1290</S>; and she called<S>7121</S> for a man<S>376</S>, and she caused him to shave off<S>1548</S> the seven<S>7651</S> locks<S>4253</S> of his head<S>7218</S>; and she began<S>2490</S> to afflict<S>6031</S> him, and his strength<S>3581</S> went<S>5493</S> from him.
And she said<S>559</S>, The Philistines<S>6430</S> be upon thee, Samson<S>8123</S>. And he awoke<S>3364</S> out of his sleep<S>8142</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I will go out<S>3318</S> as at other times before<S>6471</S>, and shake<S>5287</S> myself. And he wist<S>3045</S> not that the LORD<S>3068</S> was departed<S>5493</S> from him.
But the Philistines<S>6430</S> took<S>270</S> him, and put out<S>5365</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>, and brought him down<S>3381</S> to Gaza<S>5804</S>, and bound<S>631</S> him with fetters of brass<S>5178</S>; and he did grind<S>2912</S> in the prison<S>631</S> house<S>1004</S>. <sup>put out: Heb. bored out</sup>
Howbeit the hair<S>8181</S> of his head<S>7218</S> began<S>2490</S> to grow again<S>6779</S> after<S>834</S> he was shaven<S>1548</S>. <sup>after: or, as when he was shaven</sup>
Then the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered them together<S>622</S> for to offer<S>2076</S> a great<S>1419</S> sacrifice<S>2077</S> unto Dagon<S>1712</S> their god<S>430</S>, and to rejoice<S>8057</S>: for they said<S>559</S>, Our god<S>430</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> Samson<S>8123</S> our enemy<S>341</S> into our hand<S>3027</S>.
And when the people<S>5971</S> saw<S>7200</S> him, they praised<S>1984</S> their god<S>430</S>: for they said<S>559</S>, Our god<S>430</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> into our hands<S>3027</S> our enemy<S>341</S>, and the destroyer<S>2717</S> of our country<S>776</S>, which slew<S>2491</S> many<S>7235</S> of us. <sup>which: Heb. and who multiplied our slain</sup>
And it came to pass, when their hearts<S>3820</S> were merry<S>2896</S>, that they said<S>559</S>, Call<S>7121</S> for Samson<S>8123</S>, that he may make us sport<S>7832</S>. And they called<S>7121</S> for Samson<S>8123</S> out of the prison<S>631</S> house<S>1004</S>; and he made them<S>6440</S> sport<S>6711</S>: and they set<S>5975</S> him between the pillars<S>5982</S>. <sup>them: Heb. before them</sup>
And Samson<S>8123</S> said<S>559</S> unto the lad<S>5288</S> that held<S>2388</S> him by the hand<S>3027</S>, Suffer<S>3240</S> me that I may feel<S>4184</S> <S>3237</S> the pillars<S>5982</S> whereupon the house<S>1004</S> standeth<S>3559</S>, that I may lean<S>8172</S> upon them.
Now the house<S>1004</S> was full<S>4390</S> of men<S>582</S> and women<S>802</S>; and all the lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> were there; and there were upon the roof<S>1406</S> about three<S>7969</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S> and women<S>802</S>, that beheld<S>7200</S> while Samson<S>8123</S> made sport<S>7832</S>.
And Samson<S>8123</S> called<S>7121</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, remember<S>2142</S> me, I pray thee, and strengthen<S>2388</S> me, I pray thee, only this once<S>6471</S>, O God<S>430</S>, that I may be at once<S>259</S> avenged<S>5358</S> <S>5359</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> for my two<S>8147</S> eyes<S>5869</S>.
And Samson<S>8123</S> took hold<S>3943</S> of the two<S>8147</S> middle<S>8432</S> pillars<S>5982</S> upon which the house<S>1004</S> stood<S>3559</S>, and on which it was borne up<S>5564</S>, of the one<S>259</S> with his right hand<S>3225</S>, and of the other<S>259</S> with his left<S>8040</S>. <sup>on which: or, he leaned on them</sup>
And Samson<S>8123</S> said<S>559</S>, Let me die<S>4191</S> <S>5315</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>. And he bowed<S>5186</S> himself with all his might<S>3581</S>; and the house<S>1004</S> fell<S>5307</S> upon the lords<S>5633</S>, and upon all the people<S>5971</S> that were therein. So the dead<S>4191</S> which he slew<S>4191</S> at his death<S>4194</S> were more<S>7227</S> than they which he slew<S>4191</S> in his life<S>2416</S>. <sup>me: Heb. my soul</sup>
Then his brethren<S>251</S> and all the house<S>1004</S> of his father<S>1</S> came down<S>3381</S>, and took<S>5375</S> him, and brought him up<S>5927</S>, and buried<S>6912</S> him between Zorah<S>6881</S> and Eshtaol<S>847</S> in the buryingplace<S>6913</S> of Manoah<S>4495</S> his father<S>1</S>. And he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S> twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S>.

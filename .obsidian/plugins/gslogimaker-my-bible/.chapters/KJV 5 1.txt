These be the words<S>1697</S> which Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto all Israel<S>3478</S> on this side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, in the plain<S>6160</S> over against<S>4136</S> the Red<S>5489</S> sea, between Paran<S>6290</S>, and Tophel<S>8603</S>, and Laban<S>3837</S>, and Hazeroth<S>2698</S>, and Dizahab<S>1774</S>. <sup>the Red: or, Zuph</sup>
( There are eleven<S>259</S> <S>6240</S> days'<S>3117</S> journey from Horeb<S>2722</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Seir<S>8165</S> unto Kadeshbarnea<S>6947</S>.)
And it came to pass in the fortieth<S>705</S> year<S>8141</S>, in the eleventh<S>6249</S> <S>6240</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the first<S>259</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, that Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, according unto all that the LORD<S>3068</S> had given him in commandment<S>6680</S> unto them;
After<S>310</S> he had slain<S>5221</S> Sihon<S>5511</S> the king<S>4428</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> in Heshbon<S>2809</S>, and Og<S>5747</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Bashan<S>1316</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> at Astaroth<S>6252</S> in Edrei<S>154</S>:
On this side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, in the land<S>776</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, began<S>2974</S> Moses<S>4872</S> to declare<S>874</S> this law<S>8451</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
The LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto us in Horeb<S>2722</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Ye have dwelt<S>3427</S> long enough<S>7227</S> in this mount<S>2022</S>:
Turn<S>6437</S> you, and take your journey<S>5265</S>, and go<S>935</S> to the mount<S>2022</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, and unto all the places nigh<S>7934</S> thereunto, in the plain<S>6160</S>, in the hills<S>2022</S>, and in the vale<S>8219</S>, and in the south<S>5045</S>, and by the sea<S>3220</S> side<S>2348</S>, to the land<S>776</S> of the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, and unto Lebanon<S>3844</S>, unto the great<S>1419</S> river<S>5104</S>, the river<S>5104</S> Euphrates<S>6578</S>. <sup>all: Heb. all his neighbours</sup>
Behold<S>7200</S>, I have set<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> before<S>6440</S> you: go<S>935</S> in and possess<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto your fathers<S>1</S>, Abraham<S>85</S>, Isaac<S>3327</S>, and Jacob<S>3290</S>, to give<S>5414</S> unto them and to their seed<S>2233</S> after<S>310</S> them. <sup>set: Heb. given</sup>
And I spake<S>559</S> unto you at that time<S>6256</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I am not able<S>3201</S> to bear<S>5375</S> you myself alone<S>905</S>:
The LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> hath multiplied<S>7235</S> you, and, behold, ye are this day<S>3117</S> as the stars<S>3556</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> for multitude<S>7230</S>.
(The LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of your fathers<S>1</S> make you a thousand<S>505</S> times<S>6471</S> so many more as<S>3254</S> ye are, and bless<S>1288</S> you, as he hath promised<S>1696</S> you!)
How<S>349</S> can I myself alone bear<S>5375</S> your cumbrance<S>2960</S>, and your burden<S>4853</S>, and your strife<S>7379</S>?
Take<S>3051</S> you wise<S>2450</S> men<S>582</S>, and understanding<S>995</S>, and known<S>3045</S> among your tribes<S>7626</S>, and I will make<S>7760</S> them rulers<S>7218</S> over you. <sup>Take: Heb. Give</sup>
And ye answered<S>6030</S> me, and said<S>559</S>, The thing<S>1697</S> which thou hast spoken<S>1696</S> is good<S>2896</S> for us to do<S>6213</S>.
So I took<S>3947</S> the chief<S>7218</S> of your tribes<S>7626</S>, wise<S>2450</S> men<S>582</S>, and known<S>3045</S>, and made<S>5414</S> them heads<S>7218</S> over you, captains<S>8269</S> over thousands<S>505</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over hundreds<S>3967</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over fifties<S>2572</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over tens<S>6235</S>, and officers<S>7860</S> among your tribes<S>7626</S>. <sup>made: Heb. gave</sup>
And I charged<S>6680</S> your judges<S>8199</S> at that time<S>6256</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> the causes between your brethren<S>251</S>, and judge<S>8199</S> righteously<S>6664</S> between every man<S>376</S> and his brother<S>251</S>, and the stranger<S>1616</S> that is with him.
Ye shall not respect<S>5234</S> persons<S>6440</S> in judgment<S>4941</S>; but ye shall hear<S>8085</S> the small<S>6996</S> as well as the great<S>1419</S>; ye shall not be afraid<S>1481</S> of the face<S>6440</S> of man<S>376</S>; for the judgment<S>4941</S> is God's<S>430</S>: and the cause<S>1697</S> that is too hard<S>7185</S> for you, bring<S>7126</S> it unto me, and I will hear<S>8085</S> it. <sup>respect: Heb. acknowledge faces</sup>
And I commanded<S>6680</S> you at that time<S>6256</S> all the things<S>1697</S> which ye should do<S>6213</S>.
And when we departed<S>5265</S> from Horeb<S>2722</S>, we went through<S>3212</S> all that great<S>1419</S> and terrible<S>3372</S> wilderness<S>4057</S>, which ye saw<S>7200</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the mountain<S>2022</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> commanded<S>6680</S> us; and we came<S>935</S> to Kadeshbarnea<S>6947</S>.
And I said<S>559</S> unto you, Ye are come<S>935</S> unto the mountain<S>2022</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> doth give<S>5414</S> unto us.
Behold<S>7200</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath set<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> before<S>6440</S> thee: go up<S>5927</S> and possess<S>3423</S> it, as the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of thy fathers<S>1</S> hath said<S>1696</S> unto thee; fear<S>3372</S> not, neither be discouraged<S>2865</S>.
And ye came near<S>7126</S> unto me every one of you, and said<S>559</S>, We will send<S>7971</S> men<S>582</S> before<S>6440</S> us, and they shall search us out<S>2658</S> the land<S>776</S>, and bring<S>7725</S> us word<S>1697</S> again<S>7725</S> by what way<S>1870</S> we must go up<S>5927</S>, and into what cities<S>5892</S> we shall come<S>935</S>.
And the saying<S>1697</S> pleased me well<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S>: and I took<S>3947</S> twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> men<S>582</S> of you, one<S>259</S> of a tribe<S>376</S> <S>7626</S>:
And they turned<S>6437</S> and went up<S>5927</S> into the mountain<S>2022</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto the valley<S>5158</S> of Eshcol<S>812</S>, and searched it out<S>7270</S>.
And they took<S>3947</S> of the fruit<S>6529</S> of the land<S>776</S> in their hands<S>3027</S>, and brought it down<S>3381</S> unto us, and brought<S>7725</S> us word<S>1697</S> again<S>7725</S>, and said<S>559</S>, It is a good<S>2896</S> land<S>776</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> doth give<S>5414</S> us.
Notwithstanding ye would<S>14</S> not go up<S>5927</S>, but rebelled<S>4784</S> against the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>:
And ye murmured<S>7279</S> in your tents<S>168</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Because the LORD<S>3068</S> hated<S>8135</S> us, he hath brought us forth<S>3318</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, to deliver<S>5414</S> us into the hand<S>3027</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, to destroy<S>8045</S> us.
Whither shall we go up<S>5927</S>? our brethren<S>251</S> have discouraged<S>4549</S> our heart<S>3824</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The people<S>5971</S> is greater<S>1419</S> and taller<S>7311</S> than we; the cities<S>5892</S> are great<S>1419</S> and walled up<S>1219</S> to heaven<S>8064</S>; and moreover we have seen<S>7200</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of the Anakims<S>6062</S> there. <sup>discouraged: Heb. melted</sup>
Then I said<S>559</S> unto you, Dread<S>6206</S> not, neither be afraid<S>3372</S> of them.
The LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> which goeth<S>1980</S> before<S>6440</S> you, he shall fight<S>3898</S> for you, according to all that he did<S>6213</S> for you in Egypt<S>4714</S> before your eyes<S>5869</S>;
And in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, where thou hast seen<S>7200</S> how that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> bare<S>5375</S> thee, as a man<S>376</S> doth bear<S>5375</S> his son<S>1121</S>, in all the way<S>1870</S> that ye went<S>1980</S>, until ye came<S>935</S> into this place<S>4725</S>.
Yet in this thing<S>1697</S> ye did not believe<S>539</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>,
Who went<S>1980</S> in the way<S>1870</S> before<S>6440</S> you, to search you out<S>8446</S> a place<S>4725</S> to pitch your tents<S>2583</S> in, in fire<S>784</S> by night<S>3915</S>, to shew<S>7200</S> you by what way<S>1870</S> ye should go<S>3212</S>, and in a cloud<S>6051</S> by day<S>3119</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> heard<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of your words<S>1697</S>, and was wroth<S>7107</S>, and sware<S>7650</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Surely there shall not one<S>376</S> of these men<S>582</S> of this evil<S>7451</S> generation<S>1755</S> see<S>7200</S> that good<S>2896</S> land<S>776</S>, which I sware<S>7650</S> to give<S>5414</S> unto your fathers<S>1</S>,
Save<S>2108</S> Caleb<S>3612</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jephunneh<S>3312</S>; he shall see<S>7200</S> it, and to him will I give<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> that<S>834</S> he hath trodden upon<S>1869</S>, and to his children<S>1121</S>, because he hath wholly<S>4390</S> followed<S>310</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>wholly: Heb. fulfilled to go after</sup>
Also the LORD<S>3068</S> was angry<S>599</S> with me for your sakes<S>1558</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thou also shalt not go<S>935</S> in thither<S>8033</S>.
But Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S>, which standeth<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> thee, he shall go in<S>935</S> thither: encourage<S>2388</S> him: for he shall cause Israel<S>3478</S> to inherit<S>5157</S> it.
Moreover your little ones<S>2945</S>, which ye said<S>559</S> should be a prey<S>957</S>, and your children<S>1121</S>, which in that day<S>3117</S> had no knowledge<S>3045</S> between good<S>2896</S> and evil<S>7451</S>, they shall go in<S>935</S> thither, and unto them will I give<S>5414</S> it, and they shall possess<S>3423</S> it.
But as for you, turn<S>6437</S> you, and take your journey<S>5265</S> into the wilderness<S>4057</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>.
Then ye answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto me, We have sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S>, we will go up<S>5927</S> and fight<S>3898</S>, according to all that the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> commanded<S>6680</S> us. And when ye had girded<S>2296</S> on every man<S>376</S> his weapons<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S>, ye were ready<S>1951</S> to go up<S>5927</S> into the hill<S>2022</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Say<S>559</S> unto them, Go not up<S>5927</S>, neither fight<S>3898</S>; for I am not among<S>7130</S> you; lest ye be smitten<S>5062</S> before<S>6440</S> your enemies<S>341</S>.
So I spake<S>1696</S> unto you; and ye would not hear<S>8085</S>, but rebelled<S>4784</S> against the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and went<S>5927</S> presumptuously<S>2102</S> up<S>5927</S> into the hill<S>2022</S>. <sup>went: Heb. ye were presumptuous, and went up</sup>
And the Amorites<S>567</S>, which dwelt<S>3427</S> in that mountain<S>2022</S>, came out<S>3318</S> against<S>7125</S> you, and chased<S>7291</S> you, as bees<S>1682</S> do<S>6213</S>, and destroyed<S>3807</S> you in Seir<S>8165</S>, even unto Hormah<S>2767</S>.
And ye returned<S>7725</S> and wept<S>1058</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; but the LORD<S>3068</S> would not hearken<S>8085</S> to your voice<S>6963</S>, nor give ear<S>238</S> unto you.
So ye abode<S>3427</S> in Kadesh<S>6946</S> many<S>7227</S> days<S>3117</S>, according unto the days<S>3117</S> that ye abode<S>3427</S> there.

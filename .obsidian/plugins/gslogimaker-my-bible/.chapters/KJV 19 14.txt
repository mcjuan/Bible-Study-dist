To the chief Musician<S>5329</S>, A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>. The fool<S>5036</S> hath said<S>559</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, There is no God<S>430</S>. They are corrupt<S>7843</S>, they have done abominable<S>8581</S> works<S>5949</S>, there is none that doeth<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> looked down<S>8259</S> from heaven<S>8064</S> upon the children<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, to see<S>7200</S> if there<S>3426</S> were any that did understand<S>7919</S>, and seek<S>1875</S> God<S>430</S>.
They are all gone aside<S>5493</S>, they are all together<S>3162</S> become filthy<S>444</S>: there is none that doeth<S>6213</S> good<S>2896</S>, no, not one<S>259</S>. <sup>filthy: Heb. stinking</sup>
Have all the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S> no knowledge<S>3045</S>? who eat up<S>398</S> my people<S>5971</S> as they eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, and call<S>7121</S> not upon the LORD<S>3068</S>.
There were they in great<S>6343</S> fear<S>6342</S>: for God<S>430</S> is in the generation<S>1755</S> of the righteous<S>6662</S>. <sup>were: Heb. they feared a fear</sup>
Ye have shamed<S>954</S> the counsel<S>6098</S> of the poor<S>6041</S>, because the LORD<S>3068</S> is his refuge<S>4268</S>.
Oh that<S>5414</S> the salvation<S>3444</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were come out of Zion<S>6726</S>! when the LORD<S>3068</S> bringeth back<S>7725</S> the captivity<S>7622</S> of his people<S>5971</S>, Jacob<S>3290</S> shall rejoice<S>1523</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> shall be glad<S>8055</S>. <sup>Oh: Heb. Who will give</sup>

And God<S>430</S> blessed<S>1288</S> Noah<S>5146</S> and his sons<S>1121</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Be fruitful<S>6509</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S>, and replenish<S>4390</S> the earth<S>776</S>.
And the fear of you<S>4172</S> and the dread of you<S>2844</S> shall be upon every beast<S>2416</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and upon every fowl<S>5775</S> of the air<S>8064</S>, upon all that moveth<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>127</S>, and upon all the fishes<S>1709</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>; into your hand<S>3027</S> are they delivered<S>5414</S>.
Every moving thing<S>7431</S> that liveth<S>2416</S> shall be meat<S>402</S> for you; even as the green<S>3418</S> herb<S>6212</S> have I given<S>5414</S> you all things.
But<S>389</S> flesh<S>1320</S> with the life<S>5315</S> thereof, which is the blood<S>1818</S> thereof, shall ye not eat<S>398</S>.
And surely<S>389</S> your blood<S>1818</S> of your lives<S>5315</S> will I require<S>1875</S>; at the hand<S>3027</S> of every beast<S>2416</S> will I require it<S>1875</S>, and at the hand<S>3027</S> of man<S>120</S>; at the hand<S>3027</S> of every man's<S>376</S> brother<S>251</S> will I require<S>1875</S> the life<S>5315</S> of man<S>120</S>.
Whoso sheddeth<S>8210</S> man's<S>120</S> blood<S>1818</S>, by man<S>120</S> shall his blood<S>1818</S> be shed<S>8210</S>: for in the image<S>6754</S> of God<S>430</S> made<S>6213</S> he man<S>120</S>.
And you, be ye fruitful<S>6509</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S>; bring forth abundantly<S>8317</S> in the earth<S>776</S>, and multiply<S>7235</S> therein.
And God<S>430</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S>, and to his sons<S>1121</S> with him, saying<S>559</S>,
And I, behold, I establish<S>6965</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> with you, and with your seed<S>2233</S> after you<S>310</S>;
And with every living<S>2416</S> creature<S>5315</S> that is with you, of the fowl<S>5775</S>, of the cattle<S>929</S>, and of every beast<S>2416</S> of the earth<S>776</S> with you; from all that go out<S>3318</S> of the ark<S>8392</S>, to every beast<S>2416</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
And I will establish<S>6965</S> my covenant<S>1285</S> with you; neither shall all flesh<S>1320</S> be cut off<S>3772</S> any more by the waters<S>4325</S> of a flood<S>3999</S>; neither shall there any more be a flood<S>3999</S> to destroy<S>7843</S> the earth<S>776</S>.
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, This is the token<S>226</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> which I<S>589</S> make<S>5414</S> between me and you and every living<S>2416</S> creature<S>5315</S> that is with you, for perpetual<S>5769</S> generations<S>1755</S>:
I do set<S>5414</S> my bow<S>7198</S> in the cloud<S>6051</S>, and it shall be for a token<S>226</S> of a covenant<S>1285</S> between me and the earth<S>776</S>.
And it shall come to pass, when I bring<S>6049</S> a cloud<S>6051</S> over the earth<S>776</S>, that the bow<S>7198</S> shall be seen<S>7200</S> in the cloud<S>6051</S>:
And I will remember<S>2142</S> my covenant<S>1285</S>, which is between me and you and every living<S>2416</S> creature<S>5315</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S>; and the waters<S>4325</S> shall no more<S>5750</S> become a flood<S>3999</S> to destroy<S>7843</S> all flesh<S>1320</S>.
And the bow<S>7198</S> shall be in the cloud<S>6051</S>; and I will look upon it<S>7200</S>, that I may remember<S>2142</S> the everlasting<S>5769</S> covenant<S>1285</S> between<S>996</S> God<S>430</S> and<S>996</S> every living<S>2416</S> creature<S>5315</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S> that is upon the earth<S>776</S>.
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S>, This is the token<S>226</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, which I have established<S>6965</S> between me and all flesh<S>1320</S> that is upon the earth<S>776</S>.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Noah<S>5146</S>, that went forth<S>3318</S> of the ark<S>8392</S>, were Shem<S>8035</S>, and Ham<S>2526</S>, and Japheth<S>3315</S>: and Ham<S>2526</S> <S>1931</S> is the father<S>1</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>. <sup>Canaan: Heb. Chenaan</sup>
These are the three<S>7969</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Noah<S>5146</S>: and of them was the whole earth<S>776</S> overspread<S>5310</S>.
And Noah<S>5146</S> began<S>2490</S> to be an husbandman<S>376</S> <S>127</S>, and he planted<S>5193</S> a vineyard<S>3754</S>:
And he drank<S>8354</S> of the wine<S>3196</S>, and was drunken<S>7937</S>; and he was uncovered<S>1540</S> within<S>8432</S> his tent<S>168</S>.
And Ham<S>2526</S>, the father<S>1</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, saw<S>7200</S> the nakedness<S>6172</S> of his father<S>1</S>, and told<S>5046</S> his two<S>8147</S> brethren<S>251</S> without<S>2351</S>.
And Shem<S>8035</S> and Japheth<S>3315</S> took<S>3947</S> a garment<S>8071</S>, and laid<S>7760</S> it upon both<S>8147</S> their shoulders<S>7926</S>, and went<S>3212</S> backward<S>322</S>, and covered<S>3680</S> the nakedness<S>6172</S> of their father<S>1</S>; and their faces<S>6440</S> were backward<S>322</S>, and they saw<S>7200</S> not their father's<S>1</S> nakedness<S>6172</S>.
And Noah<S>5146</S> awoke<S>3364</S> from his wine<S>3196</S>, and knew<S>3045</S> what his younger<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S> had done<S>6213</S> unto him.
And he said<S>559</S>, Cursed<S>779</S> be Canaan<S>3667</S>; a servant<S>5650</S> of servants<S>5650</S> shall he be unto his brethren<S>251</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Shem<S>8035</S>; and Canaan<S>3667</S> shall be<S>1961</S> his servant<S>5650</S>. <sup>his servant: or, servant to them</sup>
God<S>430</S> shall enlarge<S>6601</S> Japheth<S>3315</S>, and he shall dwell<S>7931</S> in the tents<S>168</S> of Shem<S>8035</S>; and Canaan<S>3667</S> shall be his servant<S>5650</S>. <sup>enlarge: or, persuade</sup>
And Noah<S>5146</S> lived<S>2421</S> after<S>310</S> the flood<S>3999</S> three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And all the days<S>3117</S> of Noah<S>5146</S> were nine<S>8672</S> hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> years<S>8141</S>: and he died<S>4191</S>.

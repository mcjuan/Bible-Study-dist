In the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of the reign<S>4438</S> of king<S>4428</S> Belshazzar<S>1112</S> a vision<S>2377</S> appeared<S>7200</S> unto me, even unto me Daniel<S>1840</S>, after<S>310</S> that which appeared<S>7200</S> unto me at the first<S>8462</S>.
And I saw<S>7200</S> in a vision<S>2377</S>; and it came to pass, when I saw<S>7200</S>, that I was at Shushan<S>7800</S> in the palace<S>1002</S>, which is in the province<S>4082</S> of Elam<S>5867</S>; and I saw<S>7200</S> in a vision<S>2377</S>, and I was by the river<S>180</S> of Ulai<S>195</S>.
Then I lifted up<S>5375</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and saw<S>7200</S>, and, behold, there stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the river<S>180</S> a<S>259</S> ram<S>352</S> which had two horns<S>7161</S>: and the two horns<S>7161</S> were high<S>1364</S>; but one<S>259</S> was higher<S>1364</S> than the other<S>8145</S>, and the higher<S>1364</S> came up<S>5927</S> last<S>314</S>. <sup>the other: Heb. the second</sup>
I saw<S>7200</S> the ram<S>352</S> pushing<S>5055</S> westward<S>3220</S>, and northward<S>6828</S>, and southward<S>5045</S>; so that no beasts<S>2416</S> might stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him, neither was there any that could deliver<S>5337</S> out of his hand<S>3027</S>; but he did<S>6213</S> according to his will<S>7522</S>, and became great<S>1431</S>.
And as I was considering<S>995</S>, behold, an he<S>5795</S> goat<S>6842</S> came<S>935</S> from the west<S>4628</S> on the face<S>6440</S> of the whole earth<S>776</S>, and touched<S>5060</S> not the ground<S>776</S>: and the goat<S>6842</S> had a notable<S>2380</S> horn<S>7161</S> between his eyes<S>5869</S>. <sup>touched: or, none touched him in the earth</sup> <sup>a notable: Heb. a horn of sight</sup>
And he came<S>935</S> to the ram<S>352</S> that had<S>1167</S> two horns<S>7161</S>, which I had seen<S>7200</S> standing<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the river<S>180</S>, and ran<S>7323</S> unto him in the fury<S>2534</S> of his power<S>3581</S>.
And I saw<S>7200</S> him come<S>5060</S> close unto<S>681</S> the ram<S>352</S>, and he was moved with choler<S>4843</S> against him, and smote<S>5221</S> the ram<S>352</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> his two<S>8147</S> horns<S>7161</S>: and there was no power<S>3581</S> in the ram<S>352</S> to stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him, but he cast him down<S>7993</S> to the ground<S>776</S>, and stamped<S>7429</S> upon him: and there was none that could deliver<S>5337</S> the ram<S>352</S> out of his hand<S>3027</S>.
Therefore the he<S>6842</S> goat<S>5795</S> waxed very<S>3966</S> great<S>1431</S>: and when he was strong<S>6105</S>, the great<S>1419</S> horn<S>7161</S> was broken<S>7665</S>; and for it came up<S>5927</S> four<S>702</S> notable ones<S>2380</S> toward the four<S>702</S> winds<S>7307</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>.
And out of one<S>259</S> of them came forth<S>3318</S> a little<S>4704</S> horn<S>7161</S>, which waxed exceeding<S>3499</S> great<S>1431</S>, toward the south<S>5045</S>, and toward the east<S>4217</S>, and toward the pleasant<S>6643</S> land.
And it waxed great<S>1431</S>, even to the host<S>6635</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>; and it cast down<S>5307</S> some of the host<S>6635</S> and of the stars<S>3556</S> to the ground<S>776</S>, and stamped<S>7429</S> upon them. <sup>to the host: or, against the host</sup>
Yea, he magnified<S>1431</S> himself even to the prince<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S>, and by him the daily<S>8548</S> sacrifice was taken away<S>7311</S> <S>7311</S>, and the place<S>4349</S> of his sanctuary<S>4720</S> was cast down<S>7993</S>. <sup>to: or, against</sup> <sup>by him: or, from him</sup>
And an host<S>6635</S> was given<S>5414</S> him against the daily<S>8548</S> sacrifice by reason of transgression<S>6588</S>, and it cast down<S>7993</S> the truth<S>571</S> to the ground<S>776</S>; and it practised<S>6213</S>, and prospered<S>6743</S>. <sup>an host: or, the host was given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice</sup>
Then I heard<S>8085</S> one<S>259</S> saint<S>6918</S> speaking<S>1696</S>, and another<S>259</S> saint<S>6918</S> said<S>559</S> unto that certain<S>6422</S> saint which spake<S>1696</S>, How long shall be the vision<S>2377</S> concerning the daily<S>8548</S> sacrifice, and the transgression<S>6588</S> of desolation<S>8074</S>, to give<S>5414</S> both the sanctuary<S>6944</S> and the host<S>6635</S> to be trodden under foot<S>4823</S>? <sup>that: or, the numberer of secrets, or, the wonderful numberer: Heb. Palmoni</sup> <sup>of: or, making desolate</sup>
And he said<S>559</S> unto me, Unto two thousand<S>505</S> and three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> days<S>6153</S> <S>1242</S>; then shall the sanctuary<S>6944</S> be cleansed<S>6663</S>. <sup>days: Heb. evening morning</sup> <sup>cleansed: Heb. justified</sup>
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel<S>1840</S>, had seen<S>7200</S> the vision<S>2377</S>, and sought<S>1245</S> for the meaning<S>998</S>, then, behold, there stood<S>5975</S> before me as the appearance<S>4758</S> of a man<S>1397</S>.
And I heard<S>8085</S> a man's<S>120</S> voice<S>6963</S> between the banks of Ulai<S>195</S>, which called<S>7121</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Gabriel<S>1403</S>, make this<S>1975</S> man to understand<S>995</S> the vision<S>4758</S>.
So he came<S>935</S> near<S>681</S> where I stood<S>5977</S>: and when he came<S>935</S>, I was afraid<S>1204</S>, and fell<S>5307</S> upon my face<S>6440</S>: but he said<S>559</S> unto me, Understand<S>995</S>, O son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>: for at the time<S>6256</S> of the end<S>7093</S> shall be the vision<S>2377</S>.
Now as he was speaking<S>1696</S> with me, I was in a deep sleep<S>7290</S> on my face<S>6440</S> toward the ground<S>776</S>: but he touched<S>5060</S> me, and set<S>5975</S> me upright<S>5977</S>. <sup>set: Heb. made me stand upon my standing</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, Behold, I will make thee know<S>3045</S> what shall be in the last end<S>319</S> of the indignation<S>2195</S>: for at the time appointed<S>4150</S> the end<S>7093</S> shall be.
The ram<S>352</S> which thou sawest<S>7200</S> having<S>1167</S> two horns<S>7161</S> are the kings<S>4428</S> of Media<S>4074</S> and Persia<S>6539</S>.
And the rough<S>8163</S> goat<S>6842</S> is the king<S>4428</S> of Grecia<S>3120</S>: and the great<S>1419</S> horn<S>7161</S> that is between his eyes<S>5869</S> is the first<S>7223</S> king<S>4428</S>.
Now that being broken<S>7665</S>, whereas four<S>702</S> stood up<S>5975</S> for it, four<S>702</S> kingdoms<S>4438</S> shall stand up<S>5975</S> out of the nation<S>1471</S>, but not in his power<S>3581</S>.
And in the latter time<S>319</S> of their kingdom<S>4438</S>, when the transgressors<S>6586</S> are come to the full<S>8552</S>, a king<S>4428</S> of fierce<S>5794</S> countenance<S>6440</S>, and understanding<S>995</S> dark sentences<S>2420</S>, shall stand up<S>5975</S>. <sup>are: Heb. are accomplished</sup>
And his power<S>3581</S> shall be mighty<S>6105</S>, but not by his own power<S>3581</S>: and he shall destroy<S>7843</S> wonderfully<S>6381</S>, and shall prosper<S>6743</S>, and practise<S>6213</S>, and shall destroy<S>7843</S> the mighty<S>6099</S> and the holy<S>6918</S> people<S>5971</S>. <sup>holy: Heb. people of the holy ones</sup>
And through his policy<S>7922</S> also he shall cause craft<S>4820</S> to prosper<S>6743</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>; and he shall magnify<S>1431</S> himself in his heart<S>3824</S>, and by peace<S>7962</S> shall destroy<S>7843</S> many<S>7227</S>: he shall also stand up<S>5975</S> against the Prince<S>8269</S> of princes<S>8269</S>; but he shall be broken<S>7665</S> without<S>657</S> hand<S>3027</S>. <sup>peace: or, prosperity</sup>
And the vision<S>4758</S> of the evening<S>6153</S> and the morning<S>1242</S> which was told<S>559</S> is true<S>571</S>: wherefore shut thou up<S>5640</S> the vision<S>2377</S>; for it shall be for many<S>7227</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And I Daniel<S>1840</S> fainted<S>1961</S>, and was sick<S>2470</S> certain days<S>3117</S>; afterward I rose up<S>6965</S>, and did<S>6213</S> the king's<S>4428</S> business<S>4399</S>; and I was astonished<S>8074</S> at the vision<S>4758</S>, but none understood<S>995</S> it.

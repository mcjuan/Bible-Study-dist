Now these are the nations<S>1471</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> left<S>3240</S>, to prove<S>5254</S> Israel<S>3478</S> by them, even as many of Israel as had not known<S>3045</S> all the wars<S>4421</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>;
Only that<S>7535</S> the generations<S>1755</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> might know<S>3045</S>, to teach<S>3925</S> them war<S>4421</S>, at the least such as before<S>6440</S> knew<S>3045</S> nothing thereof;
Namely, five<S>2568</S> lords<S>5633</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and all the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, and the Sidonians<S>6722</S>, and the Hivites<S>2340</S> that dwelt<S>3427</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Lebanon<S>3844</S>, from mount<S>2022</S> Baalhermon<S>1179</S> unto the entering in<S>935</S> of Hamath<S>2574</S>.
And they were to prove<S>5254</S> Israel<S>3478</S> by them, to know<S>3045</S> whether they would hearken<S>8085</S> unto the commandments<S>4687</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which he commanded<S>6680</S> their fathers<S>1</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> among<S>7130</S> the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, Hittites<S>2850</S>, and Amorites<S>567</S>, and Perizzites<S>6522</S>, and Hivites<S>2340</S>, and Jebusites<S>2983</S>:
And they took<S>3947</S> their daughters<S>1323</S> to be their wives<S>802</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> their daughters<S>1323</S> to their sons<S>1121</S>, and served<S>5647</S> their gods<S>430</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and forgat<S>7911</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>, and served<S>5647</S> Baalim<S>1168</S> and the groves<S>842</S>.
Therefore the anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was hot<S>2734</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>, and he sold<S>4376</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of Chushanrishathaim<S>3573</S> king<S>4428</S> of Mesopotamia<S>763</S>: and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> served<S>5647</S> Chushanrishathaim<S>3573</S> eight<S>8083</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>Mesopotamia: Heb. Aramnaharaim</sup>
And when the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> cried<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> raised up<S>6965</S> a deliverer<S>3467</S> to the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, who delivered<S>3467</S> them, even Othniel<S>6274</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kenaz<S>7073</S>, Caleb's<S>3612</S> younger<S>6996</S> brother<S>251</S>. <sup>deliverer: Heb. saviour</sup>
And the Spirit<S>7307</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came upon him, and he judged<S>8199</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and went out<S>3318</S> to war<S>4421</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> delivered<S>5414</S> Chushanrishathaim<S>3573</S> king<S>4428</S> of Mesopotamia<S>763</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>; and his hand<S>3027</S> prevailed<S>5810</S> against Chushanrishathaim<S>3573</S>. <sup>came: Heb. was</sup> <sup>Mesopotamia: Heb. Aram</sup>
And the land<S>776</S> had rest<S>8252</S> forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S>. And Othniel<S>6274</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Kenaz<S>7073</S> died<S>4191</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> again<S>3254</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> strengthened<S>2388</S> Eglon<S>5700</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>, because they had done<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And he gathered<S>622</S> unto him the children<S>1121</S> of Ammon<S>5983</S> and Amalek<S>6002</S>, and went<S>3212</S> and smote<S>5221</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, and possessed<S>3423</S> the city<S>5892</S> of palm trees<S>8558</S> <S>5899</S>.
So the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> served<S>5647</S> Eglon<S>5700</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> eighteen<S>8083</S> <S>6240</S> years<S>8141</S>.
But when the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> cried<S>2199</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> raised them up<S>6965</S> a deliverer<S>3467</S>, Ehud<S>164</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Gera<S>1617</S>, a Benjamite<S>1145</S>, a man<S>376</S> lefthanded<S>334</S> <S>3225</S>: and by him<S>3027</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> sent<S>7971</S> a present<S>4503</S> unto Eglon<S>5700</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>. <sup>a Benjamite: or, the son of Jemini</sup> <sup>lefthanded: Heb. shut of his right hand</sup>
But Ehud<S>164</S> made<S>6213</S> him a dagger<S>2719</S> which had two<S>8147</S> edges<S>6366</S>, of a cubit<S>1574</S> length<S>753</S>; and he did gird<S>2296</S> it under his raiment<S>4055</S> upon his right<S>3225</S> thigh<S>3409</S>.
And he brought<S>7126</S> the present<S>4503</S> unto Eglon<S>5700</S> king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>: and Eglon<S>5700</S> was a very<S>3966</S> fat<S>1277</S> man<S>376</S>.
And when he had made an end<S>3615</S> to offer<S>7126</S> the present<S>4503</S>, he sent away<S>7971</S> the people<S>5971</S> that bare<S>5375</S> the present<S>4503</S>.
But he himself turned again<S>7725</S> from the quarries<S>6456</S> that were by Gilgal<S>1537</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I have a secret<S>5643</S> errand<S>1697</S> unto thee, O king<S>4428</S>: who said<S>559</S>, Keep silence<S>2013</S>. And all that stood<S>5975</S> by him went out<S>3318</S> from him. <sup>quarries: or, graven images</sup>
And Ehud<S>164</S> came<S>935</S> unto him; and he was sitting<S>3427</S> in a summer<S>4747</S> parlour<S>5944</S>, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud<S>164</S> said<S>559</S>, I have a message<S>1697</S> from God<S>430</S> unto thee. And he arose<S>6965</S> out of his seat<S>3678</S>. <sup>a summer: Heb. a parlour of cooling</sup>
And Ehud<S>164</S> put forth<S>7971</S> his left<S>8040</S> hand<S>3027</S>, and took<S>3947</S> the dagger<S>2719</S> from his right<S>3225</S> thigh<S>3409</S>, and thrust<S>8628</S> it into his belly<S>990</S>:
And the haft<S>5325</S> also went in<S>935</S> after<S>310</S> the blade<S>3851</S>; and the fat<S>2459</S> closed<S>5462</S> upon<S>1157</S> the blade<S>3851</S>, so that he could not draw<S>8025</S> the dagger<S>2719</S> out of his belly<S>990</S>; and the dirt<S>6574</S> came out<S>3318</S>. <sup>the dirt: or, it came out at the buttocks</sup>
Then Ehud<S>164</S> went forth<S>3318</S> through the porch<S>4528</S>, and shut<S>5462</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the parlour<S>5944</S> upon him, and locked<S>5274</S> them.
When he was gone out<S>3318</S>, his servants<S>5650</S> came<S>935</S>; and when they saw<S>7200</S> that, behold, the doors<S>1817</S> of the parlour<S>5944</S> were locked<S>5274</S>, they said<S>559</S>, Surely he covereth<S>5526</S> his feet<S>7272</S> in his summer<S>4747</S> chamber<S>2315</S>. <sup>covereth: or, doeth his easement</sup>
And they tarried<S>2342</S> till they were ashamed<S>954</S>: and, behold, he opened<S>6605</S> not the doors<S>1817</S> of the parlour<S>5944</S>; therefore they took<S>3947</S> a key<S>4668</S>, and opened<S>6605</S> them: and, behold, their lord<S>113</S> was fallen down<S>5307</S> dead<S>4191</S> on the earth<S>776</S>.
And Ehud<S>164</S> escaped<S>4422</S> while they tarried<S>4102</S>, and passed beyond<S>5674</S> the quarries<S>6456</S>, and escaped<S>4422</S> unto Seirath<S>8167</S>.
And it came to pass, when he was come<S>935</S>, that he blew<S>8628</S> a trumpet<S>7782</S> in the mountain<S>2022</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went down<S>3381</S> with him from the mount<S>2022</S>, and he before<S>6440</S> them.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Follow<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> me: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> your enemies<S>341</S> the Moabites<S>4124</S> into your hand<S>3027</S>. And they went down<S>3381</S> after<S>310</S> him, and took<S>3920</S> the fords<S>4569</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> toward Moab<S>4124</S>, and suffered<S>5414</S> not a man<S>376</S> to pass over<S>5674</S>.
And they slew<S>5221</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> at that time<S>6256</S> about ten<S>6235</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>, all lusty<S>8082</S>, and all men<S>376</S> of valour<S>2428</S>; and there escaped<S>4422</S> not a man<S>376</S>. <sup>lusty: Heb. fat</sup>
So Moab<S>4124</S> was subdued<S>3665</S> that day<S>3117</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. And the land<S>776</S> had rest<S>8252</S> fourscore<S>8084</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And after<S>310</S> him was Shamgar<S>8044</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Anath<S>6067</S>, which slew<S>5221</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S> with an ox<S>1241</S> goad<S>4451</S>: and he also delivered<S>3467</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.

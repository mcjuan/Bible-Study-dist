And when the people<S>5971</S> saw<S>7200</S> that Moses<S>4872</S> delayed<S>954</S> to come down<S>3381</S> out of the mount<S>2022</S>, the people<S>5971</S> gathered themselves together<S>6950</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Up<S>6965</S>, make<S>6213</S> us gods<S>430</S>, which shall go<S>3212</S> before<S>6440</S> us; for as for this Moses<S>4872</S>, the man<S>376</S> that brought<S>5927</S> us up out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, we wot<S>3045</S> not what is become of him.
And Aaron<S>175</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Break off<S>6561</S> the golden<S>2091</S> earrings<S>5141</S>, which are in the ears<S>241</S> of your wives<S>802</S>, of your sons<S>1121</S>, and of your daughters<S>1323</S>, and bring<S>935</S> them unto me.
And all the people<S>5971</S> brake off<S>6561</S> the golden<S>2091</S> earrings<S>5141</S> which were in their ears<S>241</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them unto Aaron<S>175</S>.
And he received<S>3947</S> them at their hand<S>3027</S>, and fashioned<S>6696</S> it with a graving tool<S>2747</S>, after he had made<S>6213</S> it a molten<S>4541</S> calf<S>5695</S>: and they said<S>559</S>, These be thy gods<S>430</S>, O Israel<S>3478</S>, which brought<S>5927</S> thee up out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And when Aaron<S>175</S> saw<S>7200</S> it, he built<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S> before<S>6440</S> it; and Aaron<S>175</S> made proclamation<S>7121</S>, and said<S>559</S>, To morrow<S>4279</S> is a feast<S>2282</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And they rose up early<S>7925</S> on the morrow<S>4283</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, and brought<S>5066</S> peace offerings<S>8002</S>; and the people<S>5971</S> sat<S>3427</S> down to eat<S>398</S> and to drink<S>8354</S>, and rose up<S>6965</S> to play<S>6711</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, get thee down<S>3381</S>; for thy people<S>5971</S>, which thou broughtest<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, have corrupted<S>7843</S> themselves:
They have turned<S>5493</S> aside quickly<S>4118</S> out of the way<S>1870</S> which I commanded<S>6680</S> them: they have made<S>6213</S> them a molten<S>4541</S> calf<S>5695</S>, and have worshipped<S>7812</S> it, and have sacrificed<S>2076</S> thereunto, and said<S>559</S>, These be thy gods<S>430</S>, O Israel<S>3478</S>, which have brought thee up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, I have seen<S>7200</S> this people<S>5971</S>, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked<S>7186</S> <S>6203</S> people<S>5971</S>:
Now therefore let me alone<S>3240</S>, that my wrath<S>639</S> may wax hot<S>2734</S> against them, and that I may consume<S>3615</S> them: and I will make<S>6213</S> of thee a great<S>1419</S> nation<S>1471</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> besought<S>2470</S> <S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, and said<S>559</S>, LORD<S>3068</S>, why doth thy wrath<S>639</S> wax hot<S>2734</S> against thy people<S>5971</S>, which thou hast brought forth<S>3318</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> with great<S>1419</S> power<S>3581</S>, and with a mighty<S>2389</S> hand<S>3027</S>? <sup>the LORD: Heb. the face of the LORD</sup>
Wherefore should the Egyptians<S>4714</S> speak<S>559</S>, and say<S>559</S>, For mischief<S>7451</S> did he bring<S>3318</S> them out, to slay<S>2026</S> them in the mountains<S>2022</S>, and to consume<S>3615</S> them from the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>? Turn<S>7725</S> from thy fierce<S>2740</S> wrath<S>639</S>, and repent<S>5162</S> of this evil<S>7451</S> against thy people<S>5971</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> Abraham<S>85</S>, Isaac<S>3327</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S>, thy servants<S>5650</S>, to whom thou swarest<S>7650</S> by thine own self, and saidst<S>1696</S> unto them, I will multiply<S>7235</S> your seed<S>2233</S> as the stars<S>3556</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, and all this land<S>776</S> that I have spoken<S>559</S> of will I give<S>5414</S> unto your seed<S>2233</S>, and they shall inherit<S>5157</S> it for ever<S>5769</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> repented<S>5162</S> of the evil<S>7451</S> which he thought<S>1696</S> to do<S>6213</S> unto his people<S>5971</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> turned<S>6437</S>, and went down<S>3381</S> from the mount<S>2022</S>, and the two<S>8147</S> tables<S>3871</S> of the testimony<S>5715</S> were in his hand<S>3027</S>: the tables<S>3871</S> were written<S>3789</S> on both<S>8147</S> their sides<S>5676</S>; on the one side and on the other were they written<S>3789</S>.
And the tables<S>3871</S> were the work<S>4639</S> of God<S>430</S>, and the writing<S>4385</S> was the writing<S>4385</S> of God<S>430</S>, graven<S>2801</S> upon the tables<S>3871</S>.
And when Joshua<S>3091</S> heard<S>8085</S> the noise<S>6963</S> of the people<S>5971</S> as they shouted<S>7452</S>, he said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, There is a noise<S>6963</S> of war<S>4421</S> in the camp<S>4264</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, It is not the voice<S>6963</S> of them that shout<S>6030</S> for mastery<S>1369</S>, neither is it the voice<S>6963</S> of them that cry<S>6030</S> for being overcome<S>2476</S>: but the noise<S>6963</S> of them that sing<S>6031</S> do I hear<S>8085</S>. <sup>being: Heb. weakness</sup>
And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh<S>7126</S> unto the camp<S>4264</S>, that he saw<S>7200</S> the calf<S>5695</S>, and the dancing<S>4246</S>: and Moses'<S>4872</S> anger<S>639</S> waxed hot<S>2734</S>, and he cast<S>7993</S> the tables<S>3871</S> out of his hands<S>3027</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> them beneath<S>8478</S> the mount<S>2022</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> the calf<S>5695</S> which they had made<S>6213</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> it in the fire<S>784</S>, and ground<S>2912</S> it to powder<S>1854</S>, and strawed<S>2219</S> it upon<S>6440</S> the water<S>4325</S>, and made the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> drink<S>8248</S> of it.
And Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto Aaron<S>175</S>, What did<S>6213</S> this people<S>5971</S> unto thee, that thou hast brought<S>935</S> so great<S>1419</S> a sin<S>2401</S> upon them?
And Aaron<S>175</S> said<S>559</S>, Let not the anger<S>639</S> of my lord<S>113</S> wax hot<S>2734</S>: thou knowest<S>3045</S> the people<S>5971</S>, that they are set on mischief<S>7451</S>.
For they said<S>559</S> unto me, Make<S>6213</S> us gods<S>430</S>, which shall go<S>3212</S> before<S>6440</S> us: for as for this Moses<S>4872</S>, the man<S>376</S> that brought us up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, we wot<S>3045</S> not what is become of him.
And I said<S>559</S> unto them, Whosoever hath any gold<S>2091</S>, let them break<S>6561</S> it off. So they gave<S>5414</S> it me: then I cast<S>7993</S> it into the fire<S>784</S>, and there came out<S>3318</S> this calf<S>5695</S>.
And when Moses<S>4872</S> saw<S>7200</S> that the people<S>5971</S> were naked<S>6544</S>; (for Aaron<S>175</S> had made them naked<S>6544</S> unto their shame<S>8103</S> among their enemies<S>6965</S>:) <sup>their enemies: Heb. those that rose up against them</sup>
Then Moses<S>4872</S> stood<S>5975</S> in the gate<S>8179</S> of the camp<S>4264</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Who is on the LORD'S<S>3068</S> side? let him come unto me. And all the sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S> gathered<S>622</S> themselves together unto him.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Put<S>7760</S> every man<S>376</S> his sword<S>2719</S> by his side<S>3409</S>, and go<S>5674</S> in and out<S>7725</S> from gate<S>8179</S> to gate<S>8179</S> throughout the camp<S>4264</S>, and slay<S>2026</S> every man<S>376</S> his brother<S>251</S>, and every man<S>376</S> his companion<S>7453</S>, and every man<S>376</S> his neighbour<S>7138</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S> did<S>6213</S> according to the word<S>1697</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>: and there fell<S>5307</S> of the people<S>5971</S> that day<S>3117</S> about three<S>7969</S> thousand<S>505</S> men<S>376</S>.
For Moses<S>4872</S> had said<S>559</S>, Consecrate yourselves<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> to day<S>3117</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>, even<S>3588</S> every man<S>376</S> upon his son<S>1121</S>, and upon his brother<S>251</S>; that he may bestow<S>5414</S> upon you a blessing<S>1293</S> this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>For Moses: or, And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, because every man hath been against his brother, etc</sup> <sup>Consecrate: Heb. Fill your hands</sup>
And it came to pass on the morrow<S>4283</S>, that Moses<S>4872</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Ye have sinned<S>2398</S> a great<S>1419</S> sin<S>2401</S>: and now I will go up<S>5927</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; peradventure<S>194</S> I shall make an atonement<S>3722</S> for<S>1157</S> your sin<S>2403</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> returned<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Oh<S>577</S>, this people<S>5971</S> have sinned<S>2398</S> a great<S>1419</S> sin<S>2401</S>, and have made<S>6213</S> them gods<S>430</S> of gold<S>2091</S>.
Yet now, if thou wilt forgive<S>5375</S> their sin<S>2403</S>--; and if not, blot<S>4229</S> me, I pray thee, out of thy book<S>5612</S> which thou hast written<S>3789</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Whosoever<S>834</S> hath sinned<S>2398</S> against me, him will I blot out<S>4229</S> of my book<S>5612</S>.
Therefore now go<S>3212</S>, lead<S>5148</S> the people<S>5971</S> unto the place of which I have spoken<S>1696</S> unto thee: behold, mine Angel<S>4397</S> shall go<S>3212</S> before<S>6440</S> thee: nevertheless in the day<S>3117</S> when I visit<S>6485</S> I will visit<S>6485</S> their sin<S>2403</S> upon them.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> plagued<S>5062</S> the people<S>5971</S>, because<S>834</S> they made<S>6213</S> the calf<S>5695</S>, which<S>834</S> Aaron<S>175</S> made<S>6213</S>.

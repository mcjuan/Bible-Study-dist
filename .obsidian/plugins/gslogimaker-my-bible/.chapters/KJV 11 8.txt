Since the day<S>3117</S> that I brought forth<S>3318</S> my people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, I chose<S>977</S> no city<S>5892</S> out of all the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S>, that my name<S>8034</S> might be therein; but I chose<S>977</S> David<S>1732</S> to be over my people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.
And it was in the heart<S>3824</S> of David<S>1732</S> my father<S>1</S> to build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> for the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto David<S>1732</S> my father<S>1</S>, Whereas<S>3282</S> <S>834</S> it was in thine heart<S>3824</S> to build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> unto my name<S>8034</S>, thou didst well<S>2895</S> that it was in thine heart<S>3824</S>.
Nevertheless<S>7535</S> thou shalt not build<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S>; but thy son<S>1121</S> that shall come forth out<S>3318</S> of thy loins<S>2504</S>, he shall build<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S> unto my name<S>8034</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hath performed<S>6965</S> his word<S>1697</S> that he spake<S>1696</S>, and I am risen up<S>6965</S> in the room of David<S>1732</S> my father<S>1</S>, and sit<S>3427</S> on the throne<S>3678</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> promised<S>1696</S>, and have built<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> for the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.

And Solomon<S>8010</S> stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in the presence of<S>5048</S> all the congregation<S>6951</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and spread forth<S>6566</S> his hands<S>3709</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>:

That thine eyes<S>5869</S> may be open<S>6605</S> unto the supplication<S>8467</S> of thy servant<S>5650</S>, and unto the supplication<S>8467</S> of thy people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, to hearken<S>8085</S> unto them in all that they call<S>7121</S> for unto thee.
For thou didst separate<S>914</S> them from among all the people<S>5971</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, to be thine inheritance<S>5159</S>, as thou spakest<S>1696</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> thy servant<S>5650</S>, when thou broughtest<S>3318</S> our fathers<S>1</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, O Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>.
And it was so, that when Solomon<S>8010</S> had made an end<S>3615</S> of praying<S>6419</S> all this prayer<S>8605</S> and supplication<S>8467</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, he arose<S>6965</S> from before<S>6440</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, from kneeling<S>3766</S> on his knees<S>1290</S> with his hands<S>3709</S> spread up<S>6566</S> to heaven<S>8064</S>.
And he stood<S>5975</S>, and blessed<S>1288</S> all the congregation<S>6951</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Blessed<S>1288</S> be the LORD<S>3068</S>, that hath given<S>5414</S> rest<S>4496</S> unto his people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, according to all that he promised<S>1696</S>: there hath not failed<S>5307</S> one<S>259</S> word<S>1697</S> of all his good<S>2896</S> promise<S>1697</S>, which he promised<S>1696</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> his servant<S>5650</S>. <sup>failed: Heb. fallen</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> be with us, as he was with our fathers<S>1</S>: let him not leave<S>5800</S> us, nor forsake<S>5203</S> us:
That he may incline<S>5186</S> our hearts<S>3824</S> unto him, to walk<S>3212</S> in all his ways<S>1870</S>, and to keep<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S>, and his statutes<S>2706</S>, and his judgments<S>4941</S>, which he commanded<S>6680</S> our fathers<S>1</S>.
And let these my words<S>1697</S>, wherewith I have made supplication<S>2603</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, be nigh<S>7138</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S>, that he maintain<S>6213</S> the cause<S>4941</S> of his servant<S>5650</S>, and the cause<S>4941</S> of his people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S> at all times<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S>, as the matter<S>1697</S> shall require: <sup>at all: Heb. the thing of a day in his day</sup>
That all the people<S>5971</S> of the earth<S>776</S> may know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> is God<S>430</S>, and that there is none else.
Let your heart<S>3824</S> therefore be perfect<S>8003</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, to walk<S>3212</S> in his statutes<S>2706</S>, and to keep<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S>, and all Israel<S>3478</S> with him, offered<S>2076</S> sacrifice<S>2077</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> offered<S>2076</S> a sacrifice<S>2077</S> of peace offerings<S>8002</S>, which he offered<S>2076</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, two<S>8147</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> oxen<S>1241</S>, and an hundred<S>3967</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> thousand<S>505</S> sheep<S>6629</S>. So the king<S>4428</S> and all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> dedicated<S>2596</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
The same day<S>3117</S> did the king<S>4428</S> hallow<S>6942</S> the middle<S>8432</S> of the court<S>2691</S> that was before<S>6440</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: for there he offered<S>6213</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, and meat offerings<S>4503</S>, and the fat<S>2459</S> of the peace offerings<S>8002</S>: because the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S> that was before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> was too little<S>6996</S> to receive<S>3557</S> the burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, and meat offerings<S>4503</S>, and the fat<S>2459</S> of the peace offerings<S>8002</S>.
And at that time<S>6256</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> held<S>6213</S> a feast<S>2282</S>, and all Israel<S>3478</S> with him, a great<S>1419</S> congregation<S>6951</S>, from the entering<S>935</S> in of Hamath<S>2574</S> unto the river<S>5158</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> and seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, even fourteen<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> days<S>3117</S>.
On the eighth<S>8066</S> day<S>3117</S> he sent<S>7971</S> the people<S>5971</S> away<S>7971</S>: and they blessed<S>1288</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and went<S>3212</S> unto their tents<S>168</S> joyful<S>8056</S> and glad<S>2896</S> of heart<S>3820</S> for all the goodness<S>2896</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> had done<S>6213</S> for David<S>1732</S> his servant<S>5650</S>, and for Israel<S>3478</S> his people<S>5971</S>. <sup>blessed: or, thanked</sup>

Wine and women will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth to harlots will become impudent.
Moths and worms shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away.
He that is hasty to give credit is lightminded; and he that sinneth shall offend against his own soul.
Whoso taketh pleasure in wickedness shall be condemned: but he that resisteth pleasures crowneth his life.

As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a word within a fool's belly.
Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it: and if he have done it, that he do it no more.
Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it: and if he have, that he speak it not again.

If a servant say to his master, I will not do as it pleaseth thee; though afterward he do it, he angereth him that nourisheth him.
The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom, neither at any time the counsel of sinners prudence.

There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust; and there is one that turneth aside to make judgment appear; and there is a wise man that justifieth in judgment.
There is a wicked man that hangeth down his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit,
Casting down his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not known, he will do thee a mischief before thou be aware.
And if for want of power he be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunity he will do evil.
A man may be known by his look, and one that hath understanding by his countenance, when thou meetest him.
A man's attire, and excessive laughter, and gait, shew what he is.

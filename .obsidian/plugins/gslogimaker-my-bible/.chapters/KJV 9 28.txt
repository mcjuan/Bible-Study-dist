And it came to pass in those days<S>3117</S>, that the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered<S>6908</S> their armies<S>4264</S> together<S>6908</S> for warfare<S>6635</S>, to fight<S>3898</S> with Israel<S>3478</S>. And Achish<S>397</S> said<S>559</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, Know<S>3045</S> thou assuredly<S>3045</S>, that thou shalt go out<S>3318</S> with me to battle<S>4264</S>, thou and thy men<S>582</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> to Achish<S>397</S>, Surely<S>3651</S> thou shalt know<S>3045</S> what thy servant<S>5650</S> can do<S>6213</S>. And Achish<S>397</S> said<S>559</S> to David<S>1732</S>, Therefore will I make<S>7760</S> thee keeper<S>8104</S> of mine head<S>7218</S> for ever<S>3117</S>.
Now Samuel<S>8050</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, and all Israel<S>3478</S> had lamented<S>5594</S> him, and buried<S>6912</S> him in Ramah<S>7414</S>, even in his own city<S>5892</S>. And Saul<S>7586</S> had put away<S>5493</S> those that had familiar spirits<S>178</S>, and the wizards<S>3049</S>, out of the land<S>776</S>.
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> gathered themselves together<S>6908</S>, and came<S>935</S> and pitched<S>2583</S> in Shunem<S>7766</S>: and Saul<S>7586</S> gathered<S>6908</S> all Israel<S>3478</S> together<S>6908</S>, and they pitched<S>2583</S> in Gilboa<S>1533</S>.
And when Saul<S>7586</S> saw<S>7200</S> the host<S>4264</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>, he was afraid<S>3372</S>, and his heart<S>3820</S> greatly<S>3966</S> trembled<S>2729</S>.
And when Saul<S>7586</S> enquired<S>7592</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> answered<S>6030</S> him not, neither by dreams<S>2472</S>, nor by Urim<S>224</S>, nor by prophets<S>5030</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Saul<S>7586</S> unto his servants<S>5650</S>, Seek<S>1245</S> me a woman<S>802</S> that hath<S>1172</S> a familiar spirit<S>178</S>, that I may go<S>3212</S> to her, and enquire<S>1875</S> of her. And his servants<S>5650</S> said<S>559</S> to him, Behold, there is a woman<S>802</S> that hath<S>1172</S> a familiar spirit<S>178</S> at Endor<S>5874</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> disguised<S>2664</S> himself, and put on<S>3847</S> other<S>312</S> raiment<S>899</S>, and he went<S>3212</S>, and two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> with him, and they came<S>935</S> to the woman<S>802</S> by night<S>3915</S>: and he said<S>559</S>, I pray thee, divine<S>7080</S> unto me by the familiar spirit<S>178</S>, and bring me him up<S>5927</S>, whom I shall name<S>559</S> unto thee.
And the woman<S>802</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, thou knowest<S>3045</S> what Saul<S>7586</S> hath done<S>6213</S>, how he hath cut off<S>3772</S> those that have familiar spirits<S>178</S>, and the wizards<S>3049</S>, out of the land<S>776</S>: wherefore then layest thou a snare<S>5367</S> for my life<S>5315</S>, to cause me to die<S>4191</S>?
And Saul<S>7586</S> sware<S>7650</S> to her by the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, there shall<S>518</S> no punishment<S>5771</S> happen<S>7136</S> to thee for this thing<S>1697</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> the woman<S>802</S>, Whom shall I bring up<S>5927</S> unto thee? And he said<S>559</S>, Bring me up<S>5927</S> Samuel<S>8050</S>.
And when the woman<S>802</S> saw<S>7200</S> Samuel<S>8050</S>, she cried<S>2199</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>: and the woman<S>802</S> spake<S>559</S> to Saul<S>7586</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Why hast thou deceived<S>7411</S> me? for thou art Saul<S>7586</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Be not afraid<S>3372</S>: for what sawest<S>7200</S> thou? And the woman<S>802</S> said<S>559</S> unto Saul<S>7586</S>, I saw<S>7200</S> gods<S>430</S> ascending<S>5927</S> out of the earth<S>776</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto her, What form<S>8389</S> is he of? And she said<S>559</S>, An old<S>2205</S> man<S>376</S> cometh up<S>5927</S>; and he is covered<S>5844</S> with a mantle<S>4598</S>. And Saul<S>7586</S> perceived<S>3045</S> that it was Samuel<S>8050</S>, and he stooped<S>6915</S> with his face<S>639</S> to the ground<S>776</S>, and bowed<S>7812</S> himself. <sup>What: Heb. What is his form?</sup>
And Samuel<S>8050</S> said<S>559</S> to Saul<S>7586</S>, Why hast thou disquieted<S>7264</S> me, to bring me up<S>5927</S>? And Saul<S>7586</S> answered<S>559</S>, I am sore<S>3966</S> distressed<S>6887</S>; for the Philistines<S>6430</S> make war<S>3898</S> against me, and God<S>430</S> is departed<S>5493</S> from me, and answereth<S>6030</S> me no more, neither by<S>3027</S> prophets<S>5030</S>, nor by dreams<S>2472</S>: therefore I have called<S>7121</S> thee, that thou mayest make known<S>3045</S> unto me what I shall do<S>6213</S>. <sup>by prophets: Heb. by the hand of prophets</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Samuel<S>8050</S>, Wherefore then dost thou ask<S>7592</S> of me, seeing the LORD<S>3068</S> is departed<S>5493</S> from thee, and is become thine enemy<S>6145</S>?
And the LORD<S>3068</S> hath done<S>6213</S> to him, as he spake<S>1696</S> by me<S>3027</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath rent<S>7167</S> the kingdom<S>4467</S> out of thine hand<S>3027</S>, and given<S>5414</S> it to thy neighbour<S>7453</S>, even to David<S>1732</S>: <sup>to him: or, for himself</sup> <sup>me: Heb. mine hand</sup>
Because<S>834</S> thou obeyedst<S>8085</S> not the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, nor executedst<S>6213</S> his fierce<S>2740</S> wrath<S>639</S> upon Amalek<S>6002</S>, therefore hath the LORD<S>3068</S> done<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S> unto thee this day<S>3117</S>.
Moreover the LORD<S>3068</S> will also deliver<S>5414</S> Israel<S>3478</S> with thee into the hand<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>: and to morrow<S>4279</S> shalt thou and thy sons<S>1121</S> be with me: the LORD<S>3068</S> also shall deliver<S>5414</S> the host<S>4264</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>.
Then Saul<S>7586</S> fell<S>5307</S> straightway<S>4116</S> all<S>4393</S> along<S>6967</S> on the earth<S>776</S>, and was sore<S>3966</S> afraid<S>3372</S>, because of the words<S>1697</S> of Samuel<S>8050</S>: and there was no strength<S>3581</S> in him; for he had eaten<S>398</S> no bread<S>3899</S> all the day<S>3117</S>, nor all the night<S>3915</S>. <sup>fell: Heb. made haste, and fell with the fulness of his stature</sup>
And the woman<S>802</S> came<S>935</S> unto Saul<S>7586</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> that he was sore<S>3966</S> troubled<S>926</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, thine handmaid<S>8198</S> hath obeyed<S>8085</S> thy voice<S>6963</S>, and I have put<S>7760</S> my life<S>5315</S> in my hand<S>3709</S>, and have hearkened<S>8085</S> unto thy words<S>1697</S> which thou spakest<S>1696</S> unto me.
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken<S>8085</S> thou also unto the voice<S>6963</S> of thine handmaid<S>8198</S>, and let me set<S>7760</S> a morsel<S>6595</S> of bread<S>3899</S> before<S>6440</S> thee; and eat<S>398</S>, that thou mayest have strength<S>3581</S>, when thou goest<S>3212</S> on thy way<S>1870</S>.
But he refused<S>3985</S>, and said<S>559</S>, I will not eat<S>398</S>. But his servants<S>5650</S>, together with the woman<S>802</S>, compelled<S>6555</S> him; and he hearkened<S>8085</S> unto their voice<S>6963</S>. So he arose<S>6965</S> from the earth<S>776</S>, and sat<S>3427</S> upon the bed<S>4296</S>.
And the woman<S>802</S> had a fat<S>4770</S> calf<S>5695</S> in the house<S>1004</S>; and she hasted<S>4116</S>, and killed<S>2076</S> it, and took<S>3947</S> flour<S>7058</S>, and kneaded<S>3888</S> it, and did bake<S>644</S> unleavened bread<S>4682</S> thereof:
And she brought<S>5066</S> it before<S>6440</S> Saul<S>7586</S>, and before<S>6440</S> his servants<S>5650</S>; and they did eat<S>398</S>. Then they rose up<S>6965</S>, and went away<S>3212</S> that night<S>3915</S>.

And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, What is the vine<S>1612</S> tree<S>6086</S> more than any tree<S>6086</S>, or than a branch<S>2156</S> which is among the trees<S>6086</S> of the forest<S>3293</S>?
Shall wood<S>6086</S> be taken<S>3947</S> thereof to do<S>6213</S> any work<S>4399</S>? or will men take<S>3947</S> a pin<S>3489</S> of it to hang<S>8518</S> any vessel<S>3627</S> thereon?
Behold, it is cast<S>5414</S> into the fire<S>784</S> for fuel<S>402</S>; the fire<S>784</S> devoureth<S>398</S> both<S>8147</S> the ends<S>7098</S> of it, and the midst<S>8432</S> of it is burned<S>2787</S>. Is it meet<S>6743</S> for any work<S>4399</S>? <sup>Is it: Heb. Will it prosper?</sup>
Behold, when it was whole<S>8549</S>, it was meet<S>6213</S> for no work<S>4399</S>: how much less shall it be meet<S>6213</S> yet for any work<S>4399</S>, when the fire<S>784</S> hath devoured<S>398</S> it, and it is burned<S>2787</S>? <sup>meet: Heb. made fit</sup>
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; As the vine<S>1612</S> tree<S>6086</S> among the trees<S>6086</S> of the forest<S>3293</S>, which I have given<S>5414</S> to the fire<S>784</S> for fuel<S>402</S>, so will I give<S>5414</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And I will set<S>5414</S> my face<S>6440</S> against them; they shall go out<S>3318</S> from one fire<S>784</S>, and another fire<S>784</S> shall devour<S>398</S> them; and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>, when I set<S>7760</S> my face<S>6440</S> against them.
And I will make<S>5414</S> the land<S>776</S> desolate<S>8077</S>, because they have committed<S>4603</S> a trespass<S>4604</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>. <sup>committed: Heb. trespassed a trespass</sup>

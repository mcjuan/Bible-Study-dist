And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Send<S>7971</S> thou men<S>582</S>, that they may search<S>8446</S> the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, which I give<S>5414</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: of every<S>376</S> tribe<S>4294</S> of their fathers<S>1</S> shall ye send<S>7971</S> a man<S>259</S>, every one a ruler<S>5387</S> among them.
And Moses<S>4872</S> by the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> sent<S>7971</S> them from the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Paran<S>6290</S>: all those men<S>582</S> were <S>1992</S> heads<S>7218</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And these were their names<S>8034</S>: of the tribe<S>4294</S> of Reuben<S>7205</S>, Shammua<S>8051</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zaccur<S>2139</S>.

Of the tribe<S>4294</S> of Gad<S>1410</S>, Geuel<S>1345</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Machi<S>4352</S>.
These are the names<S>8034</S> of the men<S>582</S> which Moses<S>4872</S> sent<S>7971</S> to spy out<S>8446</S> the land<S>776</S>. And Moses<S>4872</S> called<S>7121</S> Oshea<S>1954</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S> Jehoshua<S>3091</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> sent<S>7971</S> them to spy out<S>8446</S> the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Get you up<S>5927</S> this way southward<S>5045</S>, and go up<S>5927</S> into the mountain<S>2022</S>:
And see<S>7200</S> the land<S>776</S>, what it is; and the people<S>5971</S> that dwelleth<S>3427</S> therein, whether they be strong<S>2389</S> or weak<S>7504</S>, few<S>4592</S> or many<S>7227</S>;
And what the land<S>776</S> is that they dwell in<S>3427</S>, whether it be good<S>2896</S> or bad<S>7451</S>; and what cities<S>5892</S> they be that they dwell<S>3427</S> in<S>2007</S>, whether in tents<S>4264</S>, or in strong holds<S>4013</S>;
And what the land<S>776</S> is, whether it be fat<S>8082</S> or lean<S>7330</S>, whether there be<S>3426</S> wood<S>6086</S> therein, or not. And be ye of good courage<S>2388</S>, and bring<S>3947</S> of the fruit<S>6529</S> of the land<S>776</S>. Now the time<S>3117</S> was the time<S>3117</S> of the firstripe<S>1061</S> grapes<S>6025</S>.
So they went up<S>5927</S>, and searched<S>8446</S> the land<S>776</S> from the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Zin<S>6790</S> unto Rehob<S>7340</S>, as men come<S>935</S> to Hamath<S>2574</S>.
And they ascended<S>5927</S> by the south<S>5045</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto Hebron<S>2275</S>; where Ahiman<S>289</S>, Sheshai<S>8344</S>, and Talmai<S>8526</S>, the children<S>3211</S> of Anak<S>6061</S>, were. (Now Hebron<S>2275</S> was built<S>1129</S> seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S> before<S>6440</S> Zoan<S>6814</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>.)
And they came<S>935</S> unto the brook<S>5158</S> of Eshcol<S>812</S>, and cut down<S>3772</S> from thence a branch<S>2156</S> with one<S>259</S> cluster<S>811</S> of grapes<S>6025</S>, and they bare<S>5375</S> it between two<S>8147</S> upon a staff<S>4132</S>; and they brought of the pomegranates<S>7416</S>, and of the figs<S>8384</S>. <sup>brook: or, valley</sup>
The place<S>4725</S> was called<S>7121</S> the brook<S>5158</S> Eshcol<S>812</S>, because of<S>182</S> the cluster of grapes<S>811</S> which the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> cut down<S>3772</S> from thence. <sup>brook: or, valley</sup> <sup>Eshcol: that is, A cluster of grapes</sup>
And they returned<S>7725</S> from searching<S>8446</S> of the land<S>776</S> after<S>7093</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And they went<S>3212</S> and came<S>935</S> to Moses<S>4872</S>, and to Aaron<S>175</S>, and to all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, unto the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Paran<S>6290</S>, to Kadesh<S>6946</S>; and brought back<S>7725</S> word<S>1697</S> unto them, and unto all the congregation<S>5712</S>, and shewed<S>7200</S> them the fruit<S>6529</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
And they told<S>5608</S> him, and said<S>559</S>, We came<S>935</S> unto the land<S>776</S> whither thou sentest<S>7971</S> us, and surely it floweth<S>2100</S> with milk<S>2461</S> and honey<S>1706</S>; and this is the fruit<S>6529</S> of it.
Nevertheless<S>657</S> the people<S>5971</S> be strong<S>5794</S> that dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S>, and the cities<S>5892</S> are walled<S>1219</S>, and very<S>3966</S> great<S>1419</S>: and moreover we saw<S>7200</S> the children<S>3211</S> of Anak<S>6061</S> there.
The Amalekites<S>6002</S> dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of the south<S>5045</S>: and the Hittites<S>2850</S>, and the Jebusites<S>2983</S>, and the Amorites<S>567</S>, dwell<S>3427</S> in the mountains<S>2022</S>: and the Canaanites<S>3669</S> dwell<S>3427</S> by the sea<S>3220</S>, and by the coast<S>3027</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>.
And Caleb<S>3612</S> stilled<S>2013</S> the people<S>5971</S> before Moses<S>4872</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Let us go up<S>5927</S> at once<S>5927</S>, and possess<S>3423</S> it; for we are well able<S>3201</S> to overcome<S>3201</S> it.
But the men<S>582</S> that went up<S>5927</S> with him said<S>559</S>, We be not able<S>3201</S> to go up<S>5927</S> against the people<S>5971</S>; for they are stronger<S>2389</S> than we.
And they brought up<S>3318</S> an evil report<S>1681</S> of the land<S>776</S> which they had searched<S>8446</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The land<S>776</S>, through which we have gone<S>5674</S> to search<S>8446</S> it, is a land<S>776</S> that eateth up<S>398</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> thereof; and all the people<S>5971</S> that we saw<S>7200</S> in it<S>8432</S> are men<S>582</S> of a great stature<S>4060</S>. <sup>men: Heb. men of statures</sup>
And there we saw<S>7200</S> the giants<S>5303</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Anak<S>6061</S>, which come of the giants<S>5303</S>: and we were in our own sight<S>5869</S> as grasshoppers<S>2284</S>, and so we were in their sight<S>5869</S>.

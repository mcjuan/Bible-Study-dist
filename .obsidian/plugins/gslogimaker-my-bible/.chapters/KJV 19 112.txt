Unto the upright<S>3477</S> there ariseth<S>2224</S> light<S>216</S> in the darkness<S>2822</S>: he is gracious<S>2587</S>, and full of compassion<S>7349</S>, and righteous<S>6662</S>.
A good<S>2896</S> man<S>376</S> sheweth favour<S>2603</S>, and lendeth<S>3867</S>: he will guide<S>3557</S> his affairs<S>1697</S> with discretion<S>4941</S>. <sup>discretion: Heb. judgment</sup>

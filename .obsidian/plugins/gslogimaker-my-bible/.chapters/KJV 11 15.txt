Now in the eighteenth<S>8083</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nebat<S>5028</S> reigned<S>4427</S> Abijam<S>38</S> over Judah<S>3063</S>.
Three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S> reigned<S>4427</S> he in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Maachah<S>4601</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Abishalom<S>53</S>.
And he walked<S>3212</S> in all the sins<S>2403</S> of his father<S>1</S>, which he had done<S>6213</S> before<S>6440</S> him: and his heart<S>3824</S> was not perfect<S>8003</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, as the heart<S>3824</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>.
Nevertheless for David's<S>1732</S> sake did the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S> give<S>5414</S> him a lamp<S>5216</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, to set up<S>6965</S> his son<S>1121</S> after<S>310</S> him, and to establish<S>5975</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: <sup>lamp: or, candle</sup>
Because David<S>1732</S> did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and turned not aside<S>5493</S> from any thing that he commanded<S>6680</S> him all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>, save only in the matter<S>1697</S> of Uriah<S>223</S> the Hittite<S>2850</S>.
And there was war<S>4421</S> between Rehoboam<S>7346</S> and Jeroboam<S>3379</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Abijam<S>38</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>? And there was war<S>4421</S> between Abijam<S>38</S> and Jeroboam<S>3379</S>.
And Abijam<S>38</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>; and they buried<S>6912</S> him in the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>: and Asa<S>609</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
And in the twentieth<S>6242</S> year<S>8141</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> reigned<S>4427</S> Asa<S>609</S> over Judah<S>3063</S>.
And forty<S>705</S> and one<S>259</S> years<S>8141</S> reigned<S>4427</S> he in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Maachah<S>4601</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Abishalom<S>53</S>. <sup>mother's: that is, grandmother's</sup>
And Asa<S>609</S> did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, as did David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>.
And he took away<S>5674</S> the sodomites<S>6945</S> out of the land<S>776</S>, and removed<S>5493</S> all the idols<S>1544</S> that his fathers<S>1</S> had made<S>6213</S>.
And also Maachah<S>4601</S> his mother<S>517</S>, even her he removed<S>5493</S> from being queen<S>1377</S>, because she had made<S>6213</S> an idol<S>4656</S> in a grove<S>842</S>; and Asa<S>609</S> destroyed<S>3772</S> her idol<S>4656</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> it by the brook<S>5158</S> Kidron<S>6939</S>. <sup>destroyed: Heb. cut off</sup>
But the high places<S>1116</S> were not removed<S>5493</S>: nevertheless Asa's<S>609</S> heart<S>3824</S> was perfect<S>8003</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S> all his days<S>3117</S>.
And he brought<S>935</S> in the things<S>6944</S> which his father<S>1</S> had dedicated<S>6944</S>, and the things which himself had dedicated<S>6944</S>, into the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, silver<S>3701</S>, and gold<S>2091</S>, and vessels<S>3627</S>. <sup>things: Heb. holy</sup>
And there was war<S>4421</S> between Asa<S>609</S> and Baasha<S>1201</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> all their days<S>3117</S>.
And Baasha<S>1201</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> went up<S>5927</S> against Judah<S>3063</S>, and built<S>1129</S> Ramah<S>7414</S>, that he might not suffer<S>5414</S> any to go out<S>3318</S> or come in<S>935</S> to Asa<S>609</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
Then Asa<S>609</S> took<S>3947</S> all the silver<S>3701</S> and the gold<S>2091</S> that were left<S>3498</S> in the treasures<S>214</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the treasures<S>214</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, and delivered<S>5414</S> them into the hand<S>3027</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>: and king<S>4428</S> Asa<S>609</S> sent<S>7971</S> them to Benhadad<S>1130</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Tabrimon<S>2886</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Hezion<S>2383</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, that dwelt<S>3427</S> at Damascus<S>1834</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
There is a league<S>1285</S> between me and thee, and between my father<S>1</S> and thy father<S>1</S>: behold, I have sent<S>7971</S> unto thee a present<S>7810</S> of silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>; come<S>3212</S> and break<S>6565</S> thy league<S>1285</S> with Baasha<S>1201</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that he may depart<S>5927</S> from me. <sup>depart: Heb. go up</sup>
So Benhadad<S>1130</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto king<S>4428</S> Asa<S>609</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> the captains<S>8269</S> of the hosts<S>2428</S> which he had against the cities<S>5892</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> Ijon<S>5859</S>, and Dan<S>1835</S>, and Abelbethmaachah<S>62</S>, and all Cinneroth<S>3672</S>, with all the land<S>776</S> of Naphtali<S>5321</S>.
And it came to pass, when Baasha<S>1201</S> heard<S>8085</S> thereof, that he left off<S>2308</S> building<S>1129</S> of Ramah<S>7414</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in Tirzah<S>8656</S>.
Then king<S>4428</S> Asa<S>609</S> made a proclamation<S>8085</S> throughout all Judah<S>3063</S>; none was exempted<S>5355</S>: and they took<S>5375</S> away the stones<S>68</S> of Ramah<S>7414</S>, and the timber<S>6086</S> thereof, wherewith Baasha<S>1201</S> had builded<S>1129</S>; and king<S>4428</S> Asa<S>609</S> built<S>1129</S> with them Geba<S>1387</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>, and Mizpah<S>4709</S>. <sup>exempted: Heb. free</sup>
The rest<S>3499</S> of all the acts<S>1697</S> of Asa<S>609</S>, and all his might<S>1369</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, and the cities<S>5892</S> which he built<S>1129</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>? Nevertheless in the time<S>6256</S> of his old age<S>2209</S> he was diseased<S>2470</S> in his feet<S>7272</S>.
And Asa<S>609</S> slept<S>7901</S> with his fathers<S>1</S>, and was buried<S>6912</S> with his fathers<S>1</S> in the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>: and Jehoshaphat<S>3092</S> his son<S>1121</S> reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead. <sup>Jehoshaphat: Gr. Josaphat</sup>
And Nadab<S>5070</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> began to reign<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> in the second<S>8147</S> year<S>8141</S> of Asa<S>609</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> two<S>8147</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>began: Heb. reigned</sup>
And he did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and walked<S>3212</S> in the way<S>1870</S> of his father<S>1</S>, and in his sin<S>2403</S> wherewith he made Israel<S>3478</S> to sin<S>2398</S>.
And Baasha<S>1201</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahijah<S>281</S>, of the house<S>1004</S> of Issachar<S>3485</S>, conspired<S>7194</S> against him; and Baasha<S>1201</S> smote<S>5221</S> him at Gibbethon<S>1405</S>, which belonged to the Philistines<S>6430</S>; for Nadab<S>5070</S> and all Israel<S>3478</S> laid siege<S>6696</S> to Gibbethon<S>1405</S>.
Even in the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of Asa<S>609</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> did Baasha<S>1201</S> slay<S>4191</S> him, and reigned<S>4427</S> in his stead.
And it came to pass, when he reigned<S>4427</S>, that he smote<S>5221</S> all the house<S>1004</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S>; he left<S>7604</S> not to Jeroboam<S>3379</S> any that breathed<S>5397</S>, until he had destroyed<S>8045</S> him, according unto the saying<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which he spake<S>1696</S> by<S>3027</S> his servant<S>5650</S> Ahijah<S>281</S> the Shilonite<S>7888</S>:
Because of the sins<S>2403</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> which he sinned<S>2398</S>, and which he made Israel<S>3478</S> sin<S>2398</S>, by his provocation<S>3708</S> wherewith he provoked the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to anger<S>3707</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the acts<S>1697</S> of Nadab<S>5070</S>, and all that he did<S>6213</S>, are they not written<S>3789</S> in the book<S>5612</S> of the chronicles<S>1697</S> <S>3117</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>?
And there was war<S>4421</S> between Asa<S>609</S> and Baasha<S>1201</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> all their days<S>3117</S>.
In the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of Asa<S>609</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> began Baasha<S>1201</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahijah<S>281</S> to reign<S>4427</S> over all Israel<S>3478</S> in Tirzah<S>8656</S>, twenty<S>6242</S> and four<S>702</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> evil<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and walked<S>3212</S> in the way<S>1870</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S>, and in his sin<S>2403</S> wherewith he made Israel<S>3478</S> to sin<S>2398</S>.

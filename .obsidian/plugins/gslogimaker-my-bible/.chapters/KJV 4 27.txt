Then came<S>7126</S> the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Hepher<S>2660</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Gilead<S>1568</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Machir<S>4353</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, of the families<S>4940</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>: and these are the names<S>8034</S> of his daughters<S>1323</S>; Mahlah<S>4244</S>, Noah<S>5270</S>, and Hoglah<S>2295</S>, and Milcah<S>4435</S>, and Tirzah<S>8656</S>.
And they stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, and before<S>6440</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and before<S>6440</S> the princes<S>5387</S> and all the congregation<S>5712</S>, by the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Our father<S>1</S> died<S>4191</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and he was not in<S>8432</S> the company<S>5712</S> of them that gathered themselves together<S>3259</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> in the company<S>5712</S> of Korah<S>7141</S>; but died<S>4191</S> in his own sin<S>2399</S>, and had no sons<S>1121</S>.
Why should the name<S>8034</S> of our father<S>1</S> be done away<S>1639</S> from among<S>8432</S> his family<S>4940</S>, because he hath no son<S>1121</S>? Give<S>5414</S> unto us therefore a possession<S>272</S> among<S>8432</S> the brethren<S>251</S> of our father<S>1</S>. <sup>done: Heb. diminished</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> brought<S>7126</S> their cause<S>4941</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
The daughters<S>1323</S> of Zelophehad<S>6765</S> speak<S>1696</S> right<S>3651</S>: thou shalt surely<S>5414</S> give<S>5414</S> them a possession<S>272</S> of an inheritance<S>5159</S> among<S>8432</S> their father's<S>1</S> brethren<S>251</S>; and thou shalt cause the inheritance<S>5159</S> of their father<S>1</S> to pass<S>5674</S> unto them.
And thou shalt speak<S>1696</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, If a man<S>376</S> die<S>4191</S>, and have no son<S>1121</S>, then ye shall cause his inheritance<S>5159</S> to pass<S>5674</S> unto his daughter<S>1323</S>.
And if he have no daughter<S>1323</S>, then ye shall give<S>5414</S> his inheritance<S>5159</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>.
And if he have no brethren<S>251</S>, then ye shall give<S>5414</S> his inheritance<S>5159</S> unto his father's<S>1</S> brethren<S>251</S>.
And if his father<S>1</S> have no brethren<S>251</S>, then ye shall give<S>5414</S> his inheritance<S>5159</S> unto his kinsman<S>7607</S> that is next<S>7138</S> to him of his family<S>4940</S>, and he shall possess<S>3423</S> it: and it shall be unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> a statute<S>2708</S> of judgment<S>4941</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Get thee up<S>5927</S> into this mount<S>2022</S> Abarim<S>5682</S>, and see<S>7200</S> the land<S>776</S> which I have given<S>5414</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And when thou hast seen<S>7200</S> it, thou also shalt be gathered<S>622</S> unto thy people<S>5971</S>, as Aaron<S>175</S> thy brother<S>251</S> was gathered<S>622</S>.
For ye rebelled<S>4784</S> against my commandment<S>6310</S> in the desert<S>4057</S> of Zin<S>6790</S>, in the strife<S>4808</S> of the congregation<S>5712</S>, to sanctify<S>6942</S> me at the water<S>4325</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>: that is the water<S>4325</S> of Meribah<S>4809</S> in Kadesh<S>6946</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Zin<S>6790</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Let the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of the spirits<S>7307</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S>, set<S>6485</S> a man<S>376</S> over the congregation<S>5712</S>,
Which may go out<S>3318</S> before<S>6440</S> them, and which may go in<S>935</S> before<S>6440</S> them, and which may lead them out<S>3318</S>, and which may bring them in<S>935</S>; that the congregation<S>5712</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> be not as sheep<S>6629</S> which have no shepherd<S>7462</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Take<S>3947</S> thee Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S>, a man<S>376</S> in whom is the spirit<S>7307</S>, and lay<S>5564</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> upon him;
And set<S>5975</S> him before<S>6440</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and before<S>6440</S> all the congregation<S>5712</S>; and give him a charge<S>6680</S> in their sight<S>5869</S>.
And thou shalt put<S>5414</S> some of thine honour<S>1935</S> upon him, that all the congregation<S>5712</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> may be obedient<S>8085</S>.
And he shall stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, who shall ask<S>7592</S> counsel for him after the judgment<S>4941</S> of Urim<S>224</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: at his word<S>6310</S> shall they go out<S>3318</S>, and at his word<S>6310</S> they shall come in<S>935</S>, both he, and all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> with him, even all the congregation<S>5712</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> did<S>6213</S> as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> him: and he took<S>3947</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>, and set<S>5975</S> him before<S>6440</S> Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and before<S>6440</S> all the congregation<S>5712</S>:
And he laid<S>5564</S> his hands<S>3027</S> upon him, and gave him a charge<S>6680</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>1696</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>.

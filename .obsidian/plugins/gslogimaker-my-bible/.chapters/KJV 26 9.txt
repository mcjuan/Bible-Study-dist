He cried<S>7121</S> also in mine ears<S>241</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Cause them that have charge<S>6486</S> over the city<S>5892</S> to draw near<S>7126</S>, even every man<S>376</S> with his destroying<S>4892</S> weapon<S>3627</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.
And, behold, six<S>8337</S> men<S>582</S> came<S>935</S> from the way<S>1870</S> of the higher<S>5945</S> gate<S>8179</S>, which lieth<S>6437</S> toward the north<S>6828</S>, and every man<S>376</S> a slaughter<S>4660</S> weapon<S>3627</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>; and one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> among<S>8432</S> them was clothed<S>3847</S> with linen<S>906</S>, with a writer's<S>5608</S> inkhorn<S>7083</S> by his side<S>4975</S>: and they went in<S>935</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> beside<S>681</S> the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S>. <sup>which lieth: Heb. which is turned</sup> <sup>a slaughter: Heb. a weapon of his breaking in pieces</sup> <sup>by his: Heb. upon his loins</sup>
And the glory<S>3519</S> of the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> was gone up<S>5927</S> from the cherub<S>3742</S>, whereupon he was, to the threshold<S>4670</S> of the house<S>1004</S>. And he called<S>7121</S> to the man<S>376</S> clothed<S>3847</S> with linen<S>906</S>, which had the writer's<S>5608</S> inkhorn<S>7083</S> by his side<S>4975</S>;
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Go through<S>5674</S> the midst<S>8432</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, through the midst<S>8432</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and set<S>8427</S> a mark<S>8420</S> upon the foreheads<S>4696</S> of the men<S>582</S> that sigh<S>584</S> and that cry<S>602</S> for all the abominations<S>8441</S> that be done<S>6213</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> thereof. <sup>set a mark: Heb. mark a mark</sup>
And to the others<S>428</S> he said<S>559</S> in mine hearing<S>241</S>, Go<S>5674</S> ye after<S>310</S> him through the city<S>5892</S>, and smite<S>5221</S>: let not your eye<S>5869</S> spare<S>2347</S>, neither have ye pity<S>2550</S>: <sup>mine hearing: Heb. mine ears</sup>
Slay<S>2026</S> utterly<S>4889</S> old<S>2205</S> and young<S>970</S>, both maids<S>1330</S>, and little children<S>2945</S>, and women<S>802</S>: but come not near<S>5066</S> any man<S>376</S> upon whom is the mark<S>8420</S>; and begin<S>2490</S> at my sanctuary<S>4720</S>. Then they began<S>2490</S> at the ancient<S>2205</S> men<S>582</S> which were before<S>6440</S> the house<S>1004</S>. <sup>utterly: Heb. to destruction</sup>
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Defile<S>2930</S> the house<S>1004</S>, and fill<S>4390</S> the courts<S>2691</S> with the slain<S>2491</S>: go ye forth<S>3318</S>. And they went forth<S>3318</S>, and slew<S>5221</S> in the city<S>5892</S>.
And it came to pass, while they were slaying<S>5221</S> them, and I was left<S>7604</S>, that I fell<S>5307</S> upon my face<S>6440</S>, and cried<S>2199</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Ah<S>162</S> Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>! wilt thou destroy<S>7843</S> all the residue<S>7611</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in thy pouring out<S>8210</S> of thy fury<S>2534</S> upon Jerusalem<S>3389</S>?
Then said<S>559</S> he unto me, The iniquity<S>5771</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and Judah<S>3063</S> is exceeding<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S> great<S>1419</S>, and the land<S>776</S> is full<S>4390</S> of blood<S>1818</S>, and the city<S>5892</S> full<S>4390</S> of perverseness<S>4297</S>: for they say<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> hath forsaken<S>5800</S> the earth<S>776</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> seeth<S>7200</S> not. <sup>full of blood: Heb. filled with, etc</sup> <sup>perverseness: or, wresting of judgment</sup>
And as for me also, mine eye<S>5869</S> shall not spare<S>2347</S>, neither will I have pity<S>2550</S>, but I will recompense<S>5414</S> their way<S>1870</S> upon their head<S>7218</S>.
And, behold, the man<S>376</S> clothed<S>3847</S> with linen<S>906</S>, which had the inkhorn<S>7083</S> by his side<S>4975</S>, reported<S>7725</S> the matter<S>1697</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I have done<S>6213</S> as thou hast commanded<S>6680</S> me. <sup>reported: Heb. returned the word</sup>

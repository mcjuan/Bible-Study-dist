The word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> that came unto Hosea<S>1954</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Beeri<S>882</S>, in the days<S>3117</S> of Uzziah<S>5818</S>, Jotham<S>3147</S>, Ahaz<S>271</S>, and Hezekiah<S>3169</S>, kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and in the days<S>3117</S> of Jeroboam<S>3379</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joash<S>3101</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
The beginning<S>8462</S> of the word<S>1696</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> by Hosea<S>1954</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> to Hosea<S>1954</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, take<S>3947</S> unto thee a wife<S>802</S> of whoredoms<S>2183</S> and children<S>3206</S> of whoredoms<S>2183</S>: for the land<S>776</S> hath committed great<S>2181</S> whoredom<S>2181</S>, departing from<S>310</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
So he went<S>3212</S> and took<S>3947</S> Gomer<S>1586</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Diblaim<S>1691</S>; which conceived<S>2029</S>, and bare<S>3205</S> him a son<S>1121</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Call<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Jezreel<S>3157</S>; for yet a little<S>4592</S> while, and I will avenge<S>6485</S> the blood<S>1818</S> of Jezreel<S>3157</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of Jehu<S>3058</S>, and will cause to cease<S>7673</S> the kingdom<S>4468</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>avenge: Heb. visit</sup>
And it shall come to pass at that day<S>3117</S>, that I will break<S>7665</S> the bow<S>7198</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> in the valley<S>6010</S> of Jezreel<S>3157</S>.
And she conceived again<S>2029</S>, and bare<S>3205</S> a daughter<S>1323</S>. And God said<S>559</S> unto him, Call<S>7121</S> her name<S>8034</S> Loruhamah<S>3819</S>: for I will no more<S>3254</S> have mercy<S>7355</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; but I will utterly<S>5375</S> take them away<S>5375</S>. <sup>Loruhamah: that is, Not having obtained mercy</sup> <sup>no: Heb. not add any more to</sup> <sup>but: or, that I should altogether pardon them</sup>
But I will have mercy<S>7355</S> upon the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and will save<S>3467</S> them by the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>, and will not save<S>3467</S> them by bow<S>7198</S>, nor by sword<S>2719</S>, nor by battle<S>4421</S>, by horses<S>5483</S>, nor by horsemen<S>6571</S>.
Now when she had weaned<S>1580</S> Loruhamah<S>3819</S>, she conceived<S>2029</S>, and bare<S>3205</S> a son<S>1121</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> God, Call<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Loammi<S>3818</S>: for ye are not my people<S>5971</S>, and I will not be your God. <sup>Loammi: that is, Not my people</sup>
Yet the number<S>4557</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall be as the sand<S>2344</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>, which cannot be measured<S>4058</S> nor numbered<S>5608</S>; and it shall come to pass, that in the place<S>4725</S> where it was said<S>559</S> unto them, Ye are not my people<S>5971</S>, there it shall be said<S>559</S> unto them, Ye are the sons<S>1121</S> of the living<S>2416</S> God<S>410</S>. <sup>in: or, instead of that</sup>
Then shall the children<S>1121</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> be gathered<S>6908</S> together<S>3162</S>, and appoint<S>7760</S> themselves one<S>259</S> head<S>7218</S>, and they shall come up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S>: for great<S>1419</S> shall be the day<S>3117</S> of Jezreel<S>3157</S>.

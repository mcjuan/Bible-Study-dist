And it came to pass in those days<S>3117</S>, when there was no king<S>4428</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, that there was a certain<S>376</S> Levite<S>3881</S> sojourning<S>1481</S> on the side<S>3411</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, who took<S>3947</S> to him a concubine<S>802</S> <S>6370</S> out of Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S>. <sup>a concubine: Heb. a woman a concubine, or, a wife a concubine</sup>
And his concubine<S>6370</S> played the whore<S>2181</S> against him, and went away<S>3212</S> from him unto her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S> to Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S>, and was there four<S>702</S> whole months<S>2320</S> <S>3117</S>. <sup>four whole months: or, a year and four month: Heb. days, four months</sup>
And her husband<S>376</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> after<S>310</S> her, to speak<S>1696</S> friendly<S>3820</S> unto her, and to bring her again<S>7725</S>, having his servant<S>5288</S> with him, and a couple<S>6776</S> of asses<S>2543</S>: and she brought<S>935</S> him into her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>: and when the father<S>1</S> of the damsel<S>5291</S> saw<S>7200</S> him, he rejoiced<S>8055</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him. <sup>friendly: Heb. to her heart</sup>
And his father in law<S>2859</S>, the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S>, retained<S>2388</S> him; and he abode<S>3427</S> with him three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>: so they did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>, and lodged<S>3885</S> there.
And it came to pass on the fourth<S>7243</S> day<S>3117</S>, when they arose early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, that he rose up<S>6965</S> to depart<S>3212</S>: and the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S> said<S>559</S> unto his son in law<S>2860</S>, Comfort<S>5582</S> thine heart<S>3820</S> with a morsel<S>6595</S> of bread<S>3899</S>, and afterward<S>310</S> go your way<S>3212</S>. <sup>Comfort: Heb. Strengthen</sup>
And they sat down<S>3427</S>, and did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S> both<S>8147</S> of them together<S>3162</S>: for the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S> had said<S>559</S> unto the man<S>376</S>, Be content<S>2974</S>, I pray thee, and tarry all night<S>3885</S>, and let thine heart<S>3820</S> be merry<S>3190</S>.
And when the man<S>376</S> rose up<S>6965</S> to depart<S>3212</S>, his father in law<S>2859</S> urged<S>6484</S> him: therefore he lodged<S>3885</S> there again<S>7725</S>.
And he arose early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S> on the fifth<S>2549</S> day<S>3117</S> to depart<S>3212</S>: and the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S> said<S>559</S>, Comfort<S>5582</S> thine heart<S>3824</S>, I pray thee. And they tarried<S>4102</S> until afternoon<S>3117</S> <S>5186</S>, and they did eat<S>398</S> both<S>8147</S> of them. <sup>until afternoon: Heb. till the day declined</sup>
And when the man<S>376</S> rose up<S>6965</S> to depart<S>3212</S>, he, and his concubine<S>6370</S>, and his servant<S>5288</S>, his father in law<S>2859</S>, the damsel's<S>5291</S> father<S>1</S>, said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, now the day<S>3117</S> draweth<S>7503</S> toward evening<S>6150</S>, I pray you tarry all night<S>3885</S>: behold, the day<S>3117</S> groweth to an end<S>2583</S>, lodge<S>3885</S> here, that thine heart<S>3824</S> may be merry<S>3190</S>; and to morrow<S>4279</S> get you early<S>7925</S> on your way<S>1870</S>, that thou mayest go<S>1980</S> home<S>168</S>. <sup>draweth: Heb. is weak</sup> <sup>the day groweth to an end: Heb. it is the pitching time of the day</sup> <sup>home: Heb. to thy tent</sup>
But the man<S>376</S> would<S>14</S> not tarry that night<S>3885</S>, but he rose up<S>6965</S> and departed<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> over against<S>5227</S> Jebus<S>2982</S>, which is Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and there were with him two<S>6776</S> asses<S>2543</S> saddled<S>2280</S>, his concubine<S>6370</S> also was with him. <sup>over against: Heb. to over against</sup>
And when they were by Jebus<S>2982</S>, the day<S>3117</S> was far<S>3966</S> spent<S>7286</S>; and the servant<S>5288</S> said<S>559</S> unto his master<S>113</S>, Come<S>3212</S>, I pray thee, and let us turn in<S>5493</S> into this city<S>5892</S> of the Jebusites<S>2983</S>, and lodge<S>3885</S> in it.
And his master<S>113</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, We will not turn aside<S>5493</S> hither into the city<S>5892</S> of a stranger<S>5237</S>, that is not of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; we will pass over<S>5674</S> to Gibeah<S>1390</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his servant<S>5288</S>, Come<S>3212</S>, and let us draw near<S>7126</S> to one<S>259</S> of these places<S>4725</S> to lodge all night<S>3885</S>, in Gibeah<S>1390</S>, or in Ramah<S>7414</S>.
And they passed on<S>5674</S> and went their way<S>3212</S>; and the sun<S>8121</S> went down<S>935</S> upon them when they were by<S>681</S> Gibeah<S>1390</S>, which belongeth to Benjamin<S>1144</S>.
And they turned aside<S>5493</S> thither, to go in<S>935</S> and to lodge<S>3885</S> in Gibeah<S>1390</S>: and when he went in<S>935</S>, he sat him down<S>3427</S> in a street<S>7339</S> of the city<S>5892</S>: for there was no man<S>376</S> that took<S>622</S> them into his house<S>1004</S> to lodging<S>3885</S>.
And, behold, there came<S>935</S> an old<S>2205</S> man<S>376</S> from his work<S>4639</S> out of the field<S>7704</S> at even<S>6153</S>, which was also<S>376</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>; and he sojourned<S>1481</S> in Gibeah<S>1390</S>: but the men<S>582</S> of the place<S>4725</S> were Benjamites<S>1145</S>.
And when he had lifted up<S>5375</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>, he saw<S>7200</S> a wayfaring<S>732</S> man<S>376</S> in the street<S>7339</S> of the city<S>5892</S>: and the old<S>2205</S> man<S>376</S> said<S>559</S>, Whither goest<S>3212</S> thou? and whence<S>370</S> comest<S>935</S> thou?
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, We are passing<S>5674</S> from Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S> toward the side<S>3411</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>; from thence am I: and I went<S>3212</S> to Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S>, but I am now going<S>1980</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and there is no man<S>376</S> that receiveth<S>622</S> me to house<S>1004</S>. <sup>receiveth: Heb. gathereth</sup>
Yet there is<S>3426</S> both straw<S>8401</S> and provender<S>4554</S> for our asses<S>2543</S>; and there is bread<S>3899</S> and wine<S>3196</S> also for me, and for thy handmaid<S>519</S>, and for the young man<S>5288</S> which is with thy servants<S>5650</S>: there is no want<S>4270</S> of any thing<S>1697</S>.
And the old<S>2205</S> man<S>376</S> said<S>559</S>, Peace<S>7965</S> be with thee; howsoever<S>7535</S> let all thy wants<S>4270</S> lie upon me; only lodge<S>3885</S> not in the street<S>7339</S>.
So he brought<S>935</S> him into his house<S>1004</S>, and gave provender<S>1101</S> unto the asses<S>2543</S>: and they washed<S>7364</S> their feet<S>7272</S>, and did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>.
Now as they were making their hearts<S>3820</S> merry<S>3190</S>, behold, the men<S>582</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, certain<S>582</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Belial<S>1100</S>, beset<S>5437</S> the house<S>1004</S> round about<S>5437</S>, and beat<S>1849</S> at the door<S>1817</S>, and spake<S>559</S> to the master<S>1167</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, the old<S>2205</S> man<S>376</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Bring forth<S>3318</S> the man<S>376</S> that came<S>935</S> into thine house<S>1004</S>, that we may know<S>3045</S> him.
And the man<S>376</S>, the master<S>1167</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, went out<S>3318</S> unto them, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Nay<S>408</S>, my brethren<S>251</S>, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly<S>7489</S>; seeing<S>310</S> that this man<S>376</S> is come<S>935</S> into mine house<S>1004</S>, do<S>6213</S> not this folly<S>5039</S>.
Behold, here is my daughter<S>1323</S> a maiden<S>1330</S>, and his concubine<S>6370</S>; them I will bring out<S>3318</S> now, and humble<S>6031</S> ye them, and do<S>6213</S> with them what seemeth<S>5869</S> good<S>2896</S> unto you: but unto this man<S>376</S> do<S>6213</S> not so<S>2063</S> vile<S>5039</S> a thing<S>1697</S>. <sup>so vile: Heb. the matter of this folly</sup>
But the men<S>582</S> would<S>14</S> not hearken<S>8085</S> to him: so the man<S>376</S> took<S>2388</S> his concubine<S>6370</S>, and brought<S>3318</S> her forth<S>2351</S> unto them; and they knew<S>3045</S> her, and abused<S>5953</S> her all the night<S>3915</S> until the morning<S>1242</S>: and when the day<S>7837</S> began to spring<S>5927</S>, they let her go<S>7971</S>.
Then came<S>935</S> the woman<S>802</S> in the dawning<S>6437</S> of the day<S>1242</S>, and fell down<S>5307</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of the man's<S>376</S> house<S>1004</S> where her lord<S>113</S> was, till it was light<S>216</S>.
And her lord<S>113</S> rose up<S>6965</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and opened<S>6605</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, and went out<S>3318</S> to go<S>3212</S> his way<S>1870</S>: and, behold, the woman<S>802</S> his concubine<S>6370</S> was fallen down<S>5307</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of the house<S>1004</S>, and her hands<S>3027</S> were upon the threshold<S>5592</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto her, Up<S>6965</S>, and let us be going<S>3212</S>. But none answered<S>6030</S>. Then the man<S>376</S> took<S>3947</S> her up upon an ass<S>2543</S>, and the man<S>376</S> rose up<S>6965</S>, and gat<S>3212</S> him unto his place<S>4725</S>.
And when he was come<S>935</S> into his house<S>1004</S>, he took<S>3947</S> a knife<S>3979</S>, and laid hold<S>2388</S> on his concubine<S>6370</S>, and divided<S>5408</S> her, together with her bones<S>6106</S>, into twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> pieces<S>5409</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> her into all the coasts<S>1366</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And it was so<S>1961</S>, that all that saw<S>7200</S> it said<S>559</S>, There was no such deed<S>2063</S> done nor seen<S>7200</S> from the day<S>3117</S> that the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> came up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>: consider<S>7760</S> of it, take advice<S>5779</S>, and speak<S>1696</S> your minds.

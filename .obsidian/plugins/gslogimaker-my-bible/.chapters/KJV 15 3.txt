And when the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S> was come<S>5060</S>, and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were in the cities<S>5892</S>, the people<S>5971</S> gathered themselves together<S>622</S> as one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Then stood up<S>6965</S> Jeshua<S>3442</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jozadak<S>3136</S>, and his brethren<S>251</S> the priests<S>3548</S>, and Zerubbabel<S>2216</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shealtiel<S>7597</S>, and his brethren<S>251</S>, and builded<S>1129</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, to offer<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> thereon, as it is written<S>3789</S> in the law<S>8451</S> of Moses<S>4872</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>. <sup>Jeshua: also called, Joshua</sup> <sup>Zerubbabel: Gr. Zorobabel</sup> <sup>Shealtiel: Gr. Salathiel</sup>
And they set<S>3559</S> the altar<S>4196</S> upon his bases<S>4350</S>; for fear<S>367</S> was upon them because of the people<S>5971</S> of those countries<S>776</S>: and they offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> thereon unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, even burnt offerings<S>5930</S> morning<S>1242</S> and evening<S>6153</S>.
They kept<S>6213</S> also the feast<S>2282</S> of tabernacles<S>5521</S>, as it is written<S>3789</S>, and offered the daily<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> by number<S>4557</S>, according to the custom<S>4941</S>, as the duty<S>1697</S> of every day<S>3117</S> required<S>3117</S>; <sup>as the duty: Heb. the matter of the day in his day</sup>
And afterward<S>310</S> offered the continual<S>8548</S> burnt offering<S>5930</S>, both of the new moons<S>2320</S>, and of all the set feasts<S>4150</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> that were consecrated<S>6942</S>, and of every one that willingly offered<S>5068</S> a freewill offering<S>5071</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
From the first<S>259</S> day<S>3117</S> of the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S> began<S>2490</S> they to offer<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>. But the foundation<S>3245</S> of the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was not yet laid<S>3245</S>. <sup>the foundation: Heb. the temple of the LORD was not yet founded</sup>
They gave<S>5414</S> money<S>3701</S> also unto the masons<S>2672</S>, and to the carpenters<S>2796</S>; and meat<S>3978</S>, and drink<S>4960</S>, and oil<S>8081</S>, unto them of Zidon<S>6722</S>, and to them of Tyre<S>6876</S>, to bring<S>935</S> cedar<S>730</S> trees<S>6086</S> from Lebanon<S>3844</S> to the sea<S>3220</S> of Joppa<S>3305</S>, according to the grant<S>7558</S> that they had of Cyrus<S>3566</S> king<S>4428</S> of Persia<S>6539</S>. <sup>carpenters: or, workmen</sup>
Now in the second<S>8145</S> year<S>8141</S> of their coming<S>935</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, in the second<S>8145</S> month<S>2320</S>, began<S>2490</S> Zerubbabel<S>2216</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shealtiel<S>7597</S>, and Jeshua<S>3442</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jozadak<S>3136</S>, and the remnant<S>7605</S> of their brethren<S>251</S> the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>, and all they that were come out<S>935</S> of the captivity<S>7628</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>; and appointed<S>5975</S> the Levites<S>3881</S>, from twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> and upward<S>4605</S>, to set forward<S>5329</S> the work<S>4399</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Then stood<S>5975</S> Jeshua<S>3442</S> with his sons<S>1121</S> and his brethren<S>251</S>, Kadmiel<S>6934</S> and his sons<S>1121</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, together<S>259</S>, to set forward<S>5329</S> the workmen<S>6213</S> <S>4399</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>: the sons<S>1121</S> of Henadad<S>2582</S>, with their sons<S>1121</S> and their brethren<S>251</S> the Levites<S>3881</S>. <sup>Judah: or, Hodaviah,Chap.2.40</sup> <sup>together: Heb. as one</sup>
And when the builders<S>1129</S> laid the foundation<S>3245</S> of the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, they set<S>5975</S> the priests<S>3548</S> in their apparel<S>3847</S> with trumpets<S>2689</S>, and the Levites<S>3881</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Asaph<S>623</S> with cymbals<S>4700</S>, to praise<S>1984</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, after the ordinance<S>3027</S> of David<S>1732</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And they sang together by course<S>6030</S> in praising<S>1984</S> and giving thanks<S>3034</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>; because he is good<S>2896</S>, for his mercy<S>2617</S> endureth for ever<S>5769</S> toward Israel<S>3478</S>. And all the people<S>5971</S> shouted<S>7321</S> with a great<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S>, when they praised<S>1984</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, because the foundation<S>3245</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was laid<S>3245</S>.
But many<S>7227</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> and Levites<S>3881</S> and chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S>, who were ancient men<S>2205</S>, that had seen<S>7200</S> the first<S>7223</S> house<S>1004</S>, when the foundation<S>3245</S> of this house<S>1004</S> was laid<S>3245</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>, wept<S>1058</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S>; and many<S>7227</S> shouted<S>8643</S> aloud<S>7311</S> for joy<S>8057</S>:
So that the people<S>5971</S> could not discern<S>5234</S> the noise<S>6963</S> of the shout<S>8643</S> of joy<S>8057</S> from the noise<S>6963</S> of the weeping<S>1065</S> of the people<S>5971</S>: for the people<S>5971</S> shouted<S>7321</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> shout<S>8643</S>, and the noise<S>6963</S> was heard<S>8085</S> afar off<S>7350</S>.

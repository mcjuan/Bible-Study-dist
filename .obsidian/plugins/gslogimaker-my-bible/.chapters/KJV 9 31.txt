Now the Philistines<S>6430</S> fought<S>3898</S> against Israel<S>3478</S>: and the men<S>582</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> fled<S>5127</S> from before<S>6440</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and fell down<S>5307</S> slain<S>2491</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Gilboa<S>1533</S>. <sup>slain: or, wounded</sup>
And the Philistines<S>6430</S> followed hard<S>1692</S> upon Saul<S>7586</S> and upon his sons<S>1121</S>; and the Philistines<S>6430</S> slew<S>5221</S> Jonathan<S>3083</S>, and Abinadab<S>41</S>, and Malchishua<S>4444</S>, Saul's<S>7586</S> sons<S>1121</S>.
And the battle<S>4421</S> went sore<S>3513</S> against Saul<S>7586</S>, and the archers<S>3384</S> <S>582</S> <S>7198</S> hit<S>4672</S> him; and he was sore<S>3966</S> wounded<S>2342</S> of the archers<S>3384</S> <S>582</S> <S>7198</S>. <sup>and the archers: Heb. and the shooters, men with bows</sup> <sup>hit: Heb. found him</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Saul<S>7586</S> unto his armourbearer<S>5375</S> <S>3627</S>, Draw<S>8025</S> thy sword<S>2719</S>, and thrust me through<S>1856</S> therewith; lest these uncircumcised<S>6189</S> come<S>935</S> and thrust me through<S>1856</S>, and abuse<S>5953</S> me. But his armourbearer<S>5375</S> <S>3627</S> would<S>14</S> not; for he was sore<S>3966</S> afraid<S>3372</S>. Therefore Saul<S>7586</S> took<S>3947</S> a sword<S>2719</S>, and fell<S>5307</S> upon it. <sup>abuse: or, mock me</sup>
And when his armourbearer<S>5375</S> <S>3627</S> saw<S>7200</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> was dead<S>4191</S>, he fell<S>5307</S> likewise upon his sword<S>2719</S>, and died<S>4191</S> with him.
So Saul<S>7586</S> died<S>4191</S>, and his three<S>7969</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and his armourbearer<S>5375</S> <S>3627</S>, and all his men<S>582</S>, that same day<S>3117</S> together<S>3162</S>.
And when the men<S>582</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> that were on the other side<S>5676</S> of the valley<S>6010</S>, and they that were on the other side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, saw<S>7200</S> that the men<S>582</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> fled<S>5127</S>, and that Saul<S>7586</S> and his sons<S>1121</S> were dead<S>4191</S>, they forsook<S>5800</S> the cities<S>5892</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>; and the Philistines<S>6430</S> came<S>935</S> and dwelt<S>3427</S> in them.
And it came to pass on the morrow<S>4283</S>, when the Philistines<S>6430</S> came<S>935</S> to strip<S>6584</S> the slain<S>2491</S>, that they found<S>4672</S> Saul<S>7586</S> and his three<S>7969</S> sons<S>1121</S> fallen<S>5307</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Gilboa<S>1533</S>.
And they cut off<S>3772</S> his head<S>7218</S>, and stripped off<S>6584</S> his armour<S>3627</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> into the land<S>776</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S> round about<S>5439</S>, to publish<S>1319</S> it in the house<S>1004</S> of their idols<S>6091</S>, and among the people<S>5971</S>.
And they put<S>7760</S> his armour<S>3627</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of Ashtaroth<S>6252</S> <S>1045</S>: and they fastened<S>8628</S> his body<S>1472</S> to the wall<S>2346</S> of Bethshan<S>1052</S>.
And when the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jabeshgilead<S>3003</S> <S>1568</S> heard<S>8085</S> of that which the Philistines<S>6430</S> had done<S>6213</S> to Saul<S>7586</S>; <sup>of that: or, concerning him that</sup>
All the valiant<S>2428</S> men<S>376</S> <S>381</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> all night<S>3915</S>, and took<S>3947</S> the body<S>1472</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> and the bodies<S>1472</S> of his sons<S>1121</S> from the wall<S>2346</S> of Bethshan<S>1052</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Jabesh<S>3003</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> them there.
And they took<S>3947</S> their bones<S>6106</S>, and buried<S>6912</S> them under a tree<S>815</S> at Jabesh<S>3003</S>, and fasted<S>6684</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>.

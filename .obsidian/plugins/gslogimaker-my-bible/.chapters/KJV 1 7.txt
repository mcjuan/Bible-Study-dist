And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S>, Come<S>935</S> thou and all thy house<S>1004</S> into the ark<S>8392</S>; for thee have I seen<S>7200</S> righteous<S>6662</S> before me<S>6440</S> in this<S>2088</S> generation<S>1755</S>.
Of every clean<S>2889</S> beast<S>929</S> thou shalt take<S>3947</S> to thee by sevens<S>7651</S> <S>7651</S>, the male<S>376</S> and his female<S>802</S>: and of beasts<S>929</S> that are not clean<S>2889</S> <S>1931</S> by two<S>8147</S>, the male<S>376</S> and his female<S>802</S>. <sup>by sevens: Heb. seven seven</sup>
Of fowls<S>5775</S> also of the air<S>8064</S> by sevens<S>7651</S> <S>7651</S>, the male<S>2145</S> and the female<S>5347</S>; to keep<S>2421</S> seed<S>2233</S> alive<S>2421</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of all the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>by sevens: Heb. seven seven</sup>
For yet<S>5750</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, and I will cause it to rain<S>4305</S> upon the earth<S>776</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>; and every<S>3605</S> living substance<S>3351</S> that I have made<S>6213</S> will I destroy<S>4229</S> from off<S>5921</S> the face<S>6440</S> of the earth<S>127</S>. <sup>destroy: Heb. blot out</sup>
And Noah<S>5146</S> did<S>6213</S> according unto all that the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> him.
And Noah<S>5146</S> was six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when the flood<S>3999</S> of waters<S>4325</S> was upon the earth<S>776</S>.
And Noah<S>5146</S> went in<S>935</S>, and his sons<S>1121</S>, and his wife<S>802</S>, and his sons'<S>1121</S> wives<S>802</S> with him, into the ark<S>8392</S>, because of<S>6440</S> the waters<S>4325</S> of the flood<S>3999</S>.
Of clean<S>2889</S> beasts<S>929</S>, and of beasts<S>929</S> that are not clean<S>2889</S>, and of fowls<S>5775</S>, and of every thing that creepeth<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>127</S>,
There went in<S>935</S> two<S>8147</S> and two<S>8147</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S> into the ark<S>8392</S>, the male<S>2145</S> and the female<S>5347</S>, as<S>834</S> God<S>430</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> Noah<S>5146</S>.
And it came to pass after seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S>, that the waters<S>4325</S> of the flood<S>3999</S> were upon the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>after: or, on the seventh day</sup>
In<S>8141</S> the six<S>8337</S> hundredth<S>3967</S> year<S>8141</S> of Noah's<S>5146</S> life<S>2416</S>, in the second<S>8145</S> month<S>2320</S>, the seventeenth<S>7651</S> <S>6240</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S>, the same<S>2088</S> day<S>3117</S> were all the fountains<S>4599</S> of the great<S>7227</S> deep<S>8415</S> broken up<S>1234</S>, and the windows<S>699</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> were opened<S>6605</S>. <sup>windows: or, floodgates</sup>
And the rain<S>1653</S> was upon the earth<S>776</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>.
In the selfsame<S>6106</S> day<S>3117</S> entered<S>935</S> Noah<S>5146</S>, and Shem<S>8035</S>, and Ham<S>2526</S>, and Japheth<S>3315</S>, the sons<S>1121</S> of Noah<S>5146</S>, and Noah's<S>5146</S> wife<S>802</S>, and the three<S>7969</S> wives<S>802</S> of his sons<S>1121</S> with them, into the ark<S>8392</S>;
They<S>1992</S>, and every beast<S>2416</S> after his kind<S>4327</S>, and all the cattle<S>929</S> after their kind<S>4327</S>, and every creeping thing<S>7431</S> that creepeth<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>776</S> after his kind<S>4327</S>, and every fowl<S>5775</S> after his kind<S>4327</S>, every bird<S>6833</S> of every sort<S>3671</S>. <sup>sort: Heb. wing</sup>
And they went in<S>935</S> unto Noah<S>5146</S> into the ark<S>8392</S>, two<S>8147</S> and two<S>8147</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S>, wherein<S>834</S> is the breath<S>7307</S> of life<S>2416</S>.
And they that went in<S>935</S>, went in<S>935</S> male<S>2145</S> and female<S>5347</S> of all flesh<S>1320</S>, as God<S>430</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> him: and the LORD<S>3068</S> shut him in<S>5462</S>.
And the flood<S>3999</S> was forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>; and the waters<S>4325</S> increased<S>7235</S>, and bare up<S>5375</S> the ark<S>8392</S>, and it was lift up<S>7311</S> above the earth<S>776</S>.
And the waters<S>4325</S> prevailed<S>1396</S>, and were increased<S>7235</S> greatly<S>3966</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>; and the ark<S>8392</S> went<S>3212</S> upon the face<S>6440</S> of the waters<S>4325</S>.
And the waters<S>4325</S> prevailed<S>1396</S> exceedingly<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>; and all the high<S>1364</S> hills<S>2022</S>, that were under<S>8478</S> the whole heaven<S>8064</S>, were covered<S>3680</S>.
Fifteen<S>6240</S> <S>2568</S> cubits<S>520</S> upward<S>4605</S> did the waters<S>4325</S> prevail<S>1396</S>; and the mountains<S>2022</S> were covered<S>3680</S>.
And all flesh<S>1320</S> died<S>1478</S> that moved<S>7430</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>, both of fowl<S>5775</S>, and of cattle<S>929</S>, and of beast<S>2416</S>, and of every creeping thing<S>8318</S> that creepeth<S>8317</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>, and every man<S>120</S>:
All in whose nostrils<S>639</S> was the breath<S>5397</S> <S>7307</S> of life<S>2416</S>, of all that was in the dry<S>2724</S> land, died<S>4191</S>. <sup>the breath: Heb. the breath of the spirit of life</sup>
And every living substance<S>3351</S> was destroyed<S>4229</S> which was upon the face<S>6440</S> of the ground<S>127</S>, both man<S>120</S>, and cattle<S>929</S>, and the creeping things<S>7431</S>, and the fowl<S>5775</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S>; and they were destroyed<S>4229</S> from the earth<S>776</S>: and Noah<S>5146</S> only<S>389</S> remained<S>7604</S> alive, and they that<S>834</S> were with him in the ark<S>8392</S>.
And the waters<S>4325</S> prevailed<S>1396</S> upon the earth<S>776</S> an hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> days<S>3117</S>.

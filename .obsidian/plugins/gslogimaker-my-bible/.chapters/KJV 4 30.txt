And Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto the heads<S>7218</S> of the tribes<S>4294</S> concerning the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, This is the thing<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S>.
If a man<S>376</S> vow<S>5087</S> a vow<S>5088</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, or swear<S>7650</S> an oath<S>7621</S> to bind<S>631</S> his soul<S>5315</S> with a bond<S>632</S>; he shall not break<S>2490</S> his word<S>1697</S>, he shall do<S>6213</S> according to all that proceedeth<S>3318</S> out of his mouth<S>6310</S>. <sup>break: Heb. profane</sup>
If a woman<S>802</S> also vow<S>5087</S> a vow<S>5088</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and bind<S>631</S> herself by a bond<S>632</S>, being in her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S> in her youth<S>5271</S>;
And her father<S>1</S> hear<S>8085</S> her vow<S>5088</S>, and her bond<S>632</S> wherewith she hath bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S>, and her father<S>1</S> shall hold his peace<S>2790</S> at her: then all her vows<S>5088</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>, and every bond<S>632</S> wherewith she hath bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>.
But if her father<S>1</S> disallow<S>5106</S> her in the day<S>3117</S> that he heareth<S>8085</S>; not any of her vows<S>5088</S>, or of her bonds<S>632</S> wherewith she hath bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S>, shall stand<S>6965</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> shall forgive<S>5545</S> her, because her father<S>1</S> disallowed<S>5106</S> her.
And if she had at all an husband<S>376</S>, when she vowed<S>5088</S>, or uttered<S>4008</S> ought out of her lips<S>8193</S>, wherewith she bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S>; <sup>she vowed: Heb. her vows were upon her</sup>
And her husband<S>376</S> heard<S>8085</S> it, and held his peace<S>2790</S> at her in the day<S>3117</S> that he heard<S>8085</S> it: then her vows<S>5088</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>, and her bonds<S>632</S> wherewith she bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>.
But if her husband<S>376</S> disallowed<S>5106</S> her on the day<S>3117</S> that he heard<S>8085</S> it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed<S>5088</S>, and that which she uttered<S>4008</S> with her lips<S>8193</S>, wherewith she bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S>, of none effect<S>6565</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> shall forgive<S>5545</S> her.
But every vow<S>5088</S> of a widow<S>490</S>, and of her that is divorced<S>1644</S>, wherewith they have bound<S>631</S> their souls<S>5315</S>, shall stand<S>6965</S> against her.
And if she vowed<S>5087</S> in her husband's<S>376</S> house<S>1004</S>, or bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S> by a bond<S>632</S> with an oath<S>7621</S>;
And her husband<S>376</S> heard<S>8085</S> it, and held his peace<S>2790</S> at her, and disallowed<S>5106</S> her not: then all her vows<S>5088</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>, and every bond<S>632</S> wherewith she bound<S>631</S> her soul<S>5315</S> shall stand<S>6965</S>.
But if her husband<S>376</S> hath utterly<S>6565</S> made them void<S>6565</S> on the day<S>3117</S> he heard<S>8085</S> them; then whatsoever proceeded<S>4161</S> out of her lips<S>8193</S> concerning her vows<S>5088</S>, or concerning the bond<S>632</S> of her soul<S>5315</S>, shall not stand<S>6965</S>: her husband<S>376</S> hath made them void<S>6565</S>; and the LORD<S>3068</S> shall forgive<S>5545</S> her.
Every vow<S>5088</S>, and every binding<S>632</S> oath<S>7621</S> to afflict<S>6031</S> the soul<S>5315</S>, her husband<S>376</S> may establish<S>6965</S> it, or her husband<S>376</S> may make it void<S>6565</S>.
But if her husband<S>376</S> altogether<S>2790</S> hold his peace<S>2790</S> at her from day<S>3117</S> to day<S>3117</S>; then he establisheth<S>6965</S> all her vows<S>5088</S>, or all her bonds<S>632</S>, which are upon her: he confirmeth<S>6965</S> them, because he held his peace<S>2790</S> at her in the day<S>3117</S> that he heard<S>8085</S> them.
But if he shall any ways<S>6565</S> make them void<S>6565</S> after<S>310</S> that he hath heard<S>8085</S> them; then he shall bear<S>5375</S> her iniquity<S>5771</S>.
These are the statutes<S>2706</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, between a man<S>376</S> and his wife<S>802</S>, between the father<S>1</S> and his daughter<S>1323</S>, being yet in her youth<S>5271</S> in her father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>.

And it came to pass in the eleventh<S>259</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S>, in the third<S>7992</S> month, in the first<S>259</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, that the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, speak<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and to his multitude<S>1995</S>; Whom art thou like<S>1819</S> in thy greatness<S>1433</S>?
Behold, the Assyrian<S>804</S> was a cedar<S>730</S> in Lebanon<S>3844</S> with fair<S>3303</S> branches<S>6057</S>, and with a shadowing<S>6751</S> shroud<S>2793</S>, and of an high<S>1362</S> stature<S>6967</S>; and his top<S>6788</S> was among the thick boughs<S>5688</S>. <sup>with fair branches: Heb. fair of branches</sup>
The waters<S>4325</S> made him great<S>1431</S>, the deep<S>8415</S> set him up on high<S>7311</S> with her rivers<S>5104</S> running<S>1980</S> round about<S>5439</S> his plants<S>4302</S>, and sent out<S>7971</S> her little rivers<S>8585</S> unto all the trees<S>6086</S> of the field<S>7704</S>. <sup>made: or, nourished him</sup> <sup>set: or, brought him up</sup> <sup>little rivers: or, conduits</sup>
Therefore his height<S>6967</S> was exalted<S>1361</S> above all the trees<S>6086</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, and his boughs<S>5634</S> were multiplied<S>7235</S>, and his branches<S>6288</S> became long<S>748</S> because of the multitude<S>7227</S> of waters<S>4325</S>, when he shot forth<S>7971</S>. <sup>when: or, when it sent them forth</sup>
All the fowls<S>5775</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> made their nests<S>7077</S> in his boughs<S>5589</S>, and under his branches<S>6288</S> did all the beasts<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S> bring forth their young<S>3205</S>, and under his shadow<S>6738</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> all great<S>7227</S> nations<S>1471</S>.
Thus was he fair<S>3302</S> in his greatness<S>1433</S>, in the length<S>753</S> of his branches<S>1808</S>: for his root<S>8328</S> was by great<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S>.
The cedars<S>730</S> in the garden<S>1588</S> of God<S>430</S> could not hide<S>6004</S> him: the fir trees<S>1265</S> were not like<S>1819</S> his boughs<S>5589</S>, and the chesnut trees<S>6196</S> were not like his branches<S>6288</S>; nor any tree<S>6086</S> in the garden<S>1588</S> of God<S>430</S> was like<S>1819</S> unto him in his beauty<S>3308</S>.
I have made<S>6213</S> him fair<S>3303</S> by the multitude<S>7230</S> of his branches<S>1808</S>: so that all the trees<S>6086</S> of Eden<S>5731</S>, that were in the garden<S>1588</S> of God<S>430</S>, envied<S>7065</S> him.
Therefore thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; Because thou hast lifted up<S>1361</S> thyself in height<S>6967</S>, and he hath shot up<S>5414</S> his top<S>6788</S> among the thick boughs<S>5688</S>, and his heart<S>3824</S> is lifted up<S>7311</S> in his height<S>1363</S>;
I have therefore delivered<S>5414</S> him into the hand<S>3027</S> of the mighty one<S>410</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>; he shall surely<S>6213</S> deal<S>6213</S> with him: I have driven him out<S>1644</S> for his wickedness<S>7562</S>. <sup>he: Heb. in doing he shall do unto him</sup>
And strangers<S>2114</S>, the terrible<S>6184</S> of the nations<S>1471</S>, have cut him off<S>3772</S>, and have left<S>5203</S> him: upon the mountains<S>2022</S> and in all the valleys<S>1516</S> his branches<S>1808</S> are fallen<S>5307</S>, and his boughs<S>6288</S> are broken<S>7665</S> by all the rivers<S>650</S> of the land<S>776</S>; and all the people<S>5971</S> of the earth<S>776</S> are gone down<S>3381</S> from his shadow<S>6738</S>, and have left<S>5203</S> him.
Upon his ruin<S>4658</S> shall all the fowls<S>5775</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S> remain<S>7931</S>, and all the beasts<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S> shall be upon his branches<S>6288</S>:
To the end that none of all the trees<S>6086</S> by the waters<S>4325</S> exalt<S>1361</S> themselves for their height<S>6967</S>, neither shoot up<S>5414</S> their top<S>6788</S> among the thick boughs<S>5688</S>, neither their trees<S>352</S> stand up<S>5975</S> in their height<S>1363</S>, all that drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>: for they are all delivered<S>5414</S> unto death<S>4194</S>, to the nether parts<S>8482</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, in the midst<S>8432</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of men<S>120</S>, with them that go down<S>3381</S> to the pit<S>953</S>. <sup>their trees: or, stand upon themselves for their height</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; In the day<S>3117</S> when he went down<S>3381</S> to the grave<S>7585</S> I caused a mourning<S>56</S>: I covered<S>3680</S> the deep<S>8415</S> for him, and I restrained<S>4513</S> the floods<S>5104</S> thereof, and the great<S>7227</S> waters<S>4325</S> were stayed<S>3607</S>: and I caused Lebanon<S>3844</S> to mourn<S>6937</S> for him, and all the trees<S>6086</S> of the field<S>7704</S> fainted<S>5969</S> for him. <sup>to mourn: Heb. to be black</sup>
I made the nations<S>1471</S> to shake<S>7493</S> at the sound<S>6963</S> of his fall<S>4658</S>, when I cast him down<S>3381</S> to hell<S>7585</S> with them that descend<S>3381</S> into the pit<S>953</S>: and all the trees<S>6086</S> of Eden<S>5731</S>, the choice<S>4005</S> and best<S>2896</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S>, all that drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>, shall be comforted<S>5162</S> in the nether parts<S>8482</S> of the earth<S>776</S>.
They also went down<S>3381</S> into hell<S>7585</S> with him unto them that be slain<S>2491</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>; and they that were his arm<S>2220</S>, that dwelt<S>3427</S> under his shadow<S>6738</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>.
To whom art thou thus like<S>1819</S> in glory<S>3519</S> and in greatness<S>1433</S> among the trees<S>6086</S> of Eden<S>5731</S>? yet shalt thou be brought down<S>3381</S> with the trees<S>6086</S> of Eden<S>5731</S> unto the nether parts<S>8482</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: thou shalt lie<S>7901</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of the uncircumcised<S>6189</S> with them that be slain<S>2491</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>. This is Pharaoh<S>6547</S> and all his multitude<S>1995</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>.

But Job<S>347</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>,
How hast thou helped<S>5826</S> him that is without power<S>3581</S>? how savest<S>3467</S> thou the arm<S>2220</S> that hath no<S>3808</S> strength<S>5797</S>?
How hast thou counselled<S>3289</S> him that hath no<S>3808</S> wisdom<S>2451</S>? and how hast thou plentifully<S>7230</S> declared<S>3045</S> the thing as it is<S>8454</S>?
To whom hast thou uttered<S>5046</S> words<S>4405</S>? and whose spirit<S>5397</S> came<S>3318</S> from thee?
Dead<S>7496</S> things are formed<S>2342</S> from under the waters<S>4325</S>, and the inhabitants<S>7931</S> thereof. <sup>and the: or, with the inhabitants</sup>
Hell<S>7585</S> is naked<S>6174</S> before him, and destruction<S>11</S> hath no covering<S>3682</S>.
He stretcheth out<S>5186</S> the north<S>6828</S> over the empty place<S>8414</S>, and hangeth<S>8518</S> the earth<S>776</S> upon nothing<S>1099</S>.
He bindeth up<S>6887</S> the waters<S>4325</S> in his thick clouds<S>5645</S>; and the cloud<S>6051</S> is not rent<S>1234</S> under them.
He holdeth back<S>270</S> the face<S>6440</S> of his throne<S>3678</S>, and spreadeth<S>6576</S> his cloud<S>6051</S> upon it.
He hath compassed<S>2328</S> the waters<S>6440</S> <S>4325</S> with bounds<S>2706</S>, until the day<S>216</S> and night<S>2822</S> come to an end<S>8503</S>. <sup>until: Heb. until the end of light with darkness</sup>
The pillars<S>5982</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> tremble<S>7322</S> and are astonished<S>8539</S> at his reproof<S>1606</S>.
He divideth<S>7280</S> the sea<S>3220</S> with his power<S>3581</S>, and by his understanding<S>8394</S> <S>8394</S> he smiteth<S>4272</S> through the proud<S>7293</S>. <sup>the proud: Heb. pride</sup>
By his spirit<S>7307</S> he hath garnished<S>8235</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>; his hand<S>3027</S> hath formed<S>2342</S> the crooked<S>1281</S> serpent<S>5175</S>.
Lo, these are parts<S>7098</S> of his ways<S>1870</S>: but how little<S>8102</S> a portion<S>1697</S> is heard<S>8085</S> of him? but the thunder<S>7482</S> of his power<S>1369</S> who can understand<S>995</S>?

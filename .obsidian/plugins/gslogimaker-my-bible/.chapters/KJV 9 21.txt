Then came<S>935</S> David<S>1732</S> to Nob<S>5011</S> to Ahimelech<S>288</S> the priest<S>3548</S>: and Ahimelech<S>288</S> was afraid<S>2729</S> at the meeting<S>7125</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man<S>376</S> with thee?
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto Ahimelech<S>288</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, The king<S>4428</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> me a business<S>1697</S>, and hath said<S>559</S> unto me, Let no man<S>376</S> know<S>3045</S> any thing<S>3972</S> of the business<S>1697</S> whereabout I send<S>7971</S> thee, and what I have commanded<S>6680</S> thee: and I have appointed<S>3045</S> my servants<S>5288</S> to such<S>6423</S> and such<S>492</S> a place<S>4725</S>.
Now therefore what is<S>3426</S> under thine hand<S>3027</S>? give<S>5414</S> me five<S>2568</S> loaves of bread<S>3899</S> in mine hand<S>3027</S>, or what there is present<S>4672</S>. <sup>present: Heb. found</sup>
And the priest<S>3548</S> answered<S>6030</S> David<S>1732</S>, and said<S>559</S>, There is no common<S>2455</S> bread<S>3899</S> under mine hand<S>3027</S>, but there is<S>3426</S> hallowed<S>6944</S> bread<S>3899</S>; if the young men<S>5288</S> have kept<S>8104</S> themselves at least<S>389</S> from women<S>802</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> answered<S>6030</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Of a truth<S>518</S> women<S>802</S> have been kept<S>6113</S> from us about these three<S>8032</S> days<S>8543</S>, since I came out<S>3318</S>, and the vessels<S>3627</S> of the young men<S>5288</S> are holy<S>6944</S>, and the bread is in a manner<S>1870</S> common<S>2455</S>, yea, though it were sanctified<S>6942</S> this day<S>3117</S> in the vessel<S>3627</S>. <sup>yea: or, especially when this day there is other sanctified in the vessel</sup>
So the priest<S>3548</S> gave<S>5414</S> him hallowed<S>6944</S> bread: for there was no bread<S>3899</S> there but the shewbread<S>3899</S> <S>6440</S>, that was taken<S>5493</S> from before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, to put<S>7760</S> hot<S>2527</S> bread<S>3899</S> in the day<S>3117</S> when it was taken away<S>3947</S>.
Now a certain man<S>376</S> of the servants<S>5650</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> was there that day<S>3117</S>, detained<S>6113</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; and his name<S>8034</S> was Doeg<S>1673</S>, an Edomite<S>130</S>, the chiefest<S>47</S> of the herdmen<S>7462</S> that belonged to Saul<S>7586</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto Ahimelech<S>288</S>, And is there<S>3426</S> not<S>371</S> here under thine hand<S>3027</S> spear<S>2595</S> or sword<S>2719</S>? for I have neither brought<S>3947</S> my sword<S>2719</S> nor my weapons<S>3627</S> with me<S>3027</S>, because the king's<S>4428</S> business<S>1697</S> required<S>1961</S> haste<S>5169</S>.
And the priest<S>3548</S> said<S>559</S>, The sword<S>2719</S> of Goliath<S>1555</S> the Philistine<S>6430</S>, whom thou slewest<S>5221</S> in the valley<S>6010</S> of Elah<S>425</S>, behold, it is here wrapped<S>3874</S> in a cloth<S>8071</S> behind<S>310</S> the ephod<S>646</S>: if thou wilt take<S>3947</S> that, take<S>3947</S> it: for there is no other<S>312</S> save<S>2108</S> that here<S>2088</S>. And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S>, There is none like that; give<S>5414</S> it me.
And David<S>1732</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and fled<S>1272</S> that day<S>3117</S> for fear<S>6440</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, and went<S>935</S> to Achish<S>397</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Gath<S>1661</S>.
And the servants<S>5650</S> of Achish<S>397</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Is not this David<S>1732</S> the king<S>4428</S> of the land<S>776</S>? did they not sing<S>6030</S> one to another of him<S>2088</S> in dances<S>4246</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Saul<S>7586</S> hath slain<S>5221</S> his thousands<S>505</S>, and David<S>1732</S> his ten thousands<S>7233</S>?
And David<S>1732</S> laid up<S>7760</S> these words<S>1697</S> in his heart<S>3824</S>, and was sore<S>3966</S> afraid<S>3372</S> of<S>6440</S> Achish<S>397</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Gath<S>1661</S>.
And he changed<S>8138</S> his behaviour<S>2940</S> before<S>5869</S> them, and feigned himself mad<S>1984</S> in their hands<S>3027</S>, and scrabbled<S>8427</S> on the doors<S>1817</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>, and let his spittle<S>7388</S> fall down<S>3381</S> upon his beard<S>2206</S>. <sup>scrabbled: or, made marks</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Achish<S>397</S> unto his servants<S>5650</S>, Lo, ye see<S>7200</S> the man<S>376</S> is mad<S>7696</S>: wherefore then have ye brought<S>935</S> him to me? <sup>is mad: or, playeth the mad man</sup>
Have I need<S>2638</S> of mad men<S>7696</S>, that ye have brought<S>935</S> this fellow to play the mad man<S>7696</S> in my presence? shall this fellow come<S>935</S> into my house<S>1004</S>?

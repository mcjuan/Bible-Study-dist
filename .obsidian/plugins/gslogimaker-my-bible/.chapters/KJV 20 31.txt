The words<S>1697</S> of king<S>4428</S> Lemuel<S>3927</S>, the prophecy<S>4853</S> that his mother<S>517</S> taught<S>3256</S> him.
What, my son<S>1248</S>? and what, the son<S>1248</S> of my womb<S>990</S>? and what, the son<S>1248</S> of my vows<S>5088</S>?
Give<S>5414</S> not thy strength<S>2428</S> unto women<S>802</S>, nor thy ways<S>1870</S> to that which destroyeth<S>4229</S> kings<S>4428</S>.
It is not for kings<S>4428</S>, O Lemuel<S>3927</S>, it is not for kings<S>4428</S> to drink<S>8354</S> wine<S>3196</S>; nor for<S>335</S> <S>176</S> princes<S>7336</S> strong drink<S>7941</S>:
Lest they drink<S>8354</S>, and forget<S>7911</S> the law<S>2710</S>, and pervert<S>8138</S> the judgment<S>1779</S> of any of the afflicted<S>1121</S> <S>6040</S>. <sup>prevert: Heb. alter</sup> <sup>of any: Heb. of all the sons of affliction</sup>
Give<S>5414</S> strong drink<S>7941</S> unto him that is ready to perish<S>6</S>, and wine<S>3196</S> unto those that be of heavy<S>4751</S> hearts<S>5315</S>. <sup>of: Heb. bitter of soul</sup>
Let him drink<S>8354</S>, and forget<S>7911</S> his poverty<S>7389</S>, and remember<S>2142</S> his misery<S>5999</S> no more.
Open<S>6605</S> thy mouth<S>6310</S> for the dumb<S>483</S> in the cause<S>1779</S> of all such as are appointed<S>1121</S> to destruction<S>2475</S>. <sup>such: Heb. the sons of destruction</sup>
Open<S>6605</S> thy mouth<S>6310</S>, judge<S>8199</S> righteously<S>6664</S>, and plead<S>1777</S> the cause of the poor<S>6041</S> and needy<S>34</S>.
Who can find<S>4672</S> a virtuous<S>2428</S> woman<S>802</S>? for her price<S>4377</S> is far<S>7350</S> above rubies<S>6443</S>.
The heart<S>3820</S> of her husband<S>1167</S> doth safely trust<S>982</S> in her, so that he shall have no need<S>2637</S> of spoil<S>7998</S>.
She will do<S>1580</S> him good<S>2896</S> and not evil<S>7451</S> all the days<S>3117</S> of her life<S>2416</S>.
She seeketh<S>1875</S> wool<S>6785</S>, and flax<S>6593</S>, and worketh<S>6213</S> willingly<S>2656</S> with her hands<S>3709</S>.
She is like the merchants'<S>5503</S> ships<S>591</S>; she bringeth<S>935</S> her food<S>3899</S> from afar<S>4801</S>.
She riseth<S>6965</S> also while it is yet night<S>3915</S>, and giveth<S>5414</S> meat<S>2964</S> to her household<S>1004</S>, and a portion<S>2706</S> to her maidens<S>5291</S>.
She considereth<S>2161</S> a field<S>7704</S>, and buyeth<S>3947</S> it: with the fruit<S>6529</S> of her hands<S>3709</S> she planteth<S>5193</S> a vineyard<S>3754</S>. <sup>buyeth: Heb. taketh</sup>
She girdeth<S>2296</S> her loins<S>4975</S> with strength<S>5797</S>, and strengtheneth<S>553</S> her arms<S>2220</S>.
She perceiveth<S>2938</S> that her merchandise<S>5504</S> is good<S>2896</S>: her candle<S>5216</S> goeth not out<S>3518</S> by night<S>3915</S>. <sup>She: Heb. She tasteth</sup>
She layeth<S>7971</S> her hands<S>3027</S> to the spindle<S>3601</S>, and her hands<S>3709</S> hold<S>8551</S> the distaff<S>6418</S>.
She stretcheth out<S>6566</S> her hand<S>3709</S> to the poor<S>6041</S>; yea, she reacheth forth<S>7971</S> her hands<S>3027</S> to the needy<S>34</S>. <sup>She: Heb. She spreadeth</sup>
She is not afraid<S>3372</S> of the snow<S>7950</S> for her household<S>1004</S>: for all her household<S>1004</S> are clothed<S>3847</S> with scarlet<S>8144</S>. <sup>scarlet: or, double garments</sup>
She maketh<S>6213</S> herself coverings of tapestry<S>4765</S>; her clothing<S>3830</S> is silk<S>8336</S> and purple<S>713</S>.
Her husband<S>1167</S> is known<S>3045</S> in the gates<S>8179</S>, when he sitteth<S>3427</S> among the elders<S>2205</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
She maketh<S>6213</S> fine linen<S>5466</S>, and selleth<S>4376</S> it; and delivereth<S>5414</S> girdles<S>2289</S> unto the merchant<S>3669</S>.
Strength<S>5797</S> and honour<S>1926</S> are her clothing<S>3830</S>; and she shall rejoice<S>7832</S> in time<S>3117</S> to come<S>314</S>.
She openeth<S>6605</S> her mouth<S>6310</S> with wisdom<S>2451</S>; and in her tongue<S>3956</S> is the law<S>8451</S> of kindness<S>2617</S>.
She looketh well<S>6822</S> to the ways<S>1979</S> <S>1979</S> of her household<S>1004</S>, and eateth<S>398</S> not the bread<S>3899</S> of idleness<S>6104</S>.
Her children<S>1121</S> arise up<S>6965</S>, and call her blessed<S>833</S>; her husband<S>1167</S> also, and he praiseth<S>1984</S> her.
Many<S>7227</S> daughters<S>1323</S> have done<S>6213</S> virtuously<S>2428</S>, but thou excellest<S>5927</S> them all. <sup>have: or, have gotten riches</sup>
Favour<S>2580</S> is deceitful<S>8267</S>, and beauty<S>3308</S> is vain<S>1892</S>: but a woman<S>802</S> that feareth<S>3373</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, she shall be praised<S>1984</S>.
Give<S>5414</S> her of the fruit<S>6529</S> of her hands<S>3027</S>; and let her own works<S>4639</S> praise<S>1984</S> her in the gates<S>8179</S>.

And king<S>4428</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Josiah<S>2977</S> reigned<S>4427</S> instead of Coniah<S>3659</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehoiakim<S>3079</S>, whom Nebuchadrezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> made king<S>4427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
But neither he, nor his servants<S>5650</S>, nor the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, did hearken<S>8085</S> unto the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which he spake<S>1696</S> by<S>3027</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>. <sup>by: Heb. by the hand of the prophet</sup>
And Zedekiah<S>6667</S> the king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S> Jehucal<S>3081</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shelemiah<S>8018</S> and Zephaniah<S>6846</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Maaseiah<S>4641</S> the priest<S>3548</S> to the prophet<S>5030</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Pray<S>6419</S> now unto the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S> for us.
Now Jeremiah<S>3414</S> came in<S>935</S> and went out<S>3318</S> among<S>8432</S> the people<S>5971</S>: for they had not put<S>5414</S> him into prison<S>1004</S> <S>3628</S>.
Then Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> army<S>2428</S> was come forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>: and when the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> that besieged<S>6696</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S> heard<S>8085</S> tidings<S>8088</S> of them, they departed<S>5927</S> from Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Then came the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> unto the prophet<S>5030</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; Thus shall ye say<S>559</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, that sent<S>7971</S> you unto me to enquire<S>1875</S> of me; Behold, Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> army<S>2428</S>, which is come forth<S>3318</S> to help<S>5833</S> you, shall return<S>7725</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S> into their own land<S>776</S>.
And the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> shall come again<S>7725</S>, and fight<S>3898</S> against this city<S>5892</S>, and take<S>3920</S> it, and burn<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>; Deceive<S>5377</S> not yourselves<S>5315</S>, saying<S>559</S>, The Chaldeans<S>3778</S> shall surely<S>1980</S> depart<S>3212</S> from us: for they shall not depart<S>3212</S>. <sup>yourselves: Heb. your souls</sup>
For though ye had smitten<S>5221</S> the whole army<S>2428</S> of the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> that fight<S>3898</S> against you, and there remained<S>7604</S> but wounded<S>1856</S> men<S>582</S> among them, yet should they rise up<S>6965</S> every man<S>376</S> in his tent<S>168</S>, and burn<S>8313</S> this city<S>5892</S> with fire<S>784</S>. <sup>wounded: Heb. thrust through</sup>
And it came to pass, that when the army<S>2428</S> of the Chaldeans<S>3778</S> was broken up<S>5927</S> from Jerusalem<S>3389</S> for fear<S>6440</S> of Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> army<S>2428</S>, <sup>broken: Heb. made to ascend</sup>
Then Jeremiah<S>3414</S> went forth<S>3318</S> out of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> to go<S>3212</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>, to separate<S>2505</S> himself thence in the midst<S>8432</S> of the people<S>5971</S>. <sup>separate: or, to slip away from thence in the midst of the people</sup>
And when he was in the gate<S>8179</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S>, a captain<S>1167</S> of the ward<S>6488</S> was there, whose name<S>8034</S> was Irijah<S>3376</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Shelemiah<S>8018</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Hananiah<S>2608</S>; and he took<S>8610</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thou fallest away<S>5307</S> to the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, It is false<S>8267</S>; I fall not away<S>5307</S> to the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>. But he hearkened<S>8085</S> not to him: so Irijah<S>3376</S> took<S>8610</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, and brought<S>935</S> him to the princes<S>8269</S>. <sup>false: Heb. falsehood, or, a lie</sup>
Wherefore the princes<S>8269</S> were wroth<S>7107</S> with Jeremiah<S>3414</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> him, and put<S>5414</S> him in prison<S>612</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S> the scribe<S>5608</S>: for they had made<S>6213</S> that the prison<S>3608</S>.
When Jeremiah<S>3414</S> was entered<S>935</S> into the dungeon<S>1004</S> <S>953</S>, and into the cabins<S>2588</S>, and Jeremiah<S>3414</S> had remained<S>3427</S> there many<S>7227</S> days<S>3117</S>; <sup>cabins: or, cells</sup>
Then Zedekiah<S>6667</S> the king<S>4428</S> sent<S>7971</S>, and took him out<S>3947</S>: and the king<S>4428</S> asked<S>7592</S> him secretly<S>5643</S> in his house<S>1004</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Is there any word<S>1697</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>? And Jeremiah<S>3414</S> said<S>559</S>, There is<S>3426</S>: for, said<S>559</S> he, thou shalt be delivered<S>5414</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>.
Moreover Jeremiah<S>3414</S> said<S>559</S> unto king<S>4428</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S>, What have I offended<S>2398</S> against thee, or against thy servants<S>5650</S>, or against this people<S>5971</S>, that ye have put<S>5414</S> me in prison<S>1004</S> <S>3608</S>?
Where are now<S>346</S> your prophets<S>5030</S> which prophesied<S>5012</S> unto you, saying<S>559</S>, The king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> shall not come<S>935</S> against you, nor against this land<S>776</S>?
Therefore hear<S>8085</S> now, I pray thee, O my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>: let my supplication<S>8467</S>, I pray thee, be accepted<S>5307</S> before<S>6440</S> thee; that thou cause me not to return<S>7725</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S> the scribe<S>5608</S>, lest I die<S>4191</S> there. <sup>let: Heb. let my supplication fall</sup>
Then Zedekiah<S>6667</S> the king<S>4428</S> commanded<S>6680</S> that they should commit<S>6485</S> Jeremiah<S>3414</S> into the court<S>2691</S> of the prison<S>4307</S>, and that they should give<S>5414</S> him daily<S>3117</S> a piece<S>3603</S> of bread<S>3899</S> out of the bakers'<S>644</S> street<S>2351</S>, until all the bread<S>3899</S> in the city<S>5892</S> were spent<S>8552</S>. Thus Jeremiah<S>3414</S> remained<S>3427</S> in the court<S>2691</S> of the prison<S>4307</S>.

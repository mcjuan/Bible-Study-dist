In those days<S>3117</S> there was no king<S>4428</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>: and in those days<S>3117</S> the tribe<S>7626</S> of the Danites<S>1839</S> sought<S>1245</S> them an inheritance<S>5159</S> to dwell in<S>3427</S>; for unto that day<S>3117</S> all their inheritance<S>5159</S> had not fallen<S>5307</S> unto them among<S>8432</S> the tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S> sent<S>7971</S> of their family<S>4940</S> five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S> from their coasts<S>7098</S>, men<S>1121</S> of valour<S>2428</S>, from Zorah<S>6881</S>, and from Eshtaol<S>847</S>, to spy<S>7270</S> out the land<S>776</S>, and to search<S>2713</S> it; and they said<S>559</S> unto them, Go<S>3212</S>, search<S>2713</S> the land<S>776</S>: who when they came<S>935</S> to mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, to the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>, they lodged<S>3885</S> there. <sup>men of: Heb. sons of</sup>
When they were by the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>, they knew<S>5234</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the young man<S>5288</S> the Levite<S>3881</S>: and they turned in<S>5493</S> thither, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Who brought<S>935</S> thee hither<S>1988</S>? and what makest<S>6213</S> thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Thus<S>2090</S> and thus<S>2090</S> dealeth<S>6213</S> Micah<S>4318</S> with me, and hath hired<S>7936</S> me, and I am his priest<S>3548</S>.
And they said<S>559</S> unto him, Ask counsel<S>7592</S>, we pray thee, of God<S>430</S>, that we may know<S>3045</S> whether our way<S>1870</S> which we go<S>1980</S> shall be prosperous<S>6743</S>.
And the priest<S>3548</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Go<S>3212</S> in peace<S>7965</S>: before<S>5227</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> is your way<S>1870</S> wherein ye go<S>3212</S>.
Then the five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S> departed<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Laish<S>3919</S>, and saw<S>7200</S> the people<S>5971</S> that were therein<S>7130</S>, how they dwelt<S>3427</S> careless<S>983</S>, after the manner<S>4941</S> of the Zidonians<S>6722</S>, quiet<S>8252</S> and secure<S>982</S>; and there was no magistrate<S>3423</S> <S>6114</S> in the land<S>776</S>, that might put them to shame<S>3637</S> in any thing<S>1697</S>; and they were far<S>7350</S> from the Zidonians<S>6722</S>, and had no business<S>1697</S> with any man<S>120</S>. <sup>magistrate: Heb. possessor, or, heir of restraint</sup>
And they came<S>935</S> unto their brethren<S>251</S> to Zorah<S>6881</S> and Eshtaol<S>847</S>: and their brethren<S>251</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, What say ye?
And they said<S>559</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, that we may go up<S>5927</S> against them: for we have seen<S>7200</S> the land<S>776</S>, and, behold, it is very<S>3966</S> good<S>2896</S>: and are ye still<S>2814</S>? be not slothful<S>6101</S> to go<S>3212</S>, and to enter<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S>.
When ye go<S>935</S>, ye shall come<S>935</S> unto a people<S>5971</S> secure<S>982</S>, and to a large<S>7342</S> land<S>776</S>: for God<S>430</S> hath given<S>5414</S> it into your hands<S>3027</S>; a place<S>4725</S> where there is no want<S>4270</S> of any thing<S>1697</S> that is in the earth<S>776</S>.
And there went<S>5265</S> from thence of the family<S>4940</S> of the Danites<S>1839</S>, out of Zorah<S>6881</S> and out of Eshtaol<S>847</S>, six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S> appointed<S>2296</S> with weapons<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S>. <sup>appointed: Heb. girded</sup>
And they went up<S>5927</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> in Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S>, in Judah<S>3063</S>: wherefore they called<S>7121</S> that place<S>4725</S> Mahanehdan<S>4265</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>: behold, it is behind<S>310</S> Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S>.
And they passed<S>5674</S> thence unto mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>.
Then answered<S>6030</S> the five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S> that went<S>1980</S> to spy out<S>7270</S> the country<S>776</S> of Laish<S>3919</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto their brethren<S>251</S>, Do ye know<S>3045</S> that there is<S>3426</S> in these houses<S>1004</S> an ephod<S>646</S>, and teraphim<S>8655</S>, and a graven image<S>6459</S>, and a molten image<S>4541</S>? now therefore consider<S>3045</S> what ye have to do<S>6213</S>.
And they turned<S>5493</S> thitherward, and came<S>935</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of the young man<S>5288</S> the Levite<S>3881</S>, even unto the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>, and saluted<S>7592</S> <S>7965</S> him. <sup>saluted: Heb. asked him of peace</sup>
And the six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S> appointed<S>2296</S> with their weapons<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S>, which were of the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S>, stood<S>5324</S> by the entering<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>.
And the five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S> that went<S>1980</S> to spy out<S>7270</S> the land<S>776</S> went up<S>5927</S>, and came in<S>935</S> thither, and took<S>3947</S> the graven image<S>6459</S>, and the ephod<S>646</S>, and the teraphim<S>8655</S>, and the molten image<S>4541</S>: and the priest<S>3548</S> stood<S>5324</S> in the entering<S>6607</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> with the six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> men<S>376</S> that were appointed<S>2296</S> with weapons<S>3627</S> of war<S>4421</S>.
And these went<S>935</S> into Micah's<S>4318</S> house<S>1004</S>, and fetched<S>3947</S> the carved image<S>6459</S>, the ephod<S>646</S>, and the teraphim<S>8655</S>, and the molten image<S>4541</S>. Then said<S>559</S> the priest<S>3548</S> unto them, What do<S>6213</S> ye?
And they said<S>559</S> unto him, Hold thy peace<S>2790</S>, lay<S>7760</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> upon thy mouth<S>6310</S>, and go<S>3212</S> with us, and be to us<S>1961</S> a father<S>1</S> and a priest<S>3548</S>: is it better<S>2896</S> for thee to be a priest<S>3548</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> of one<S>259</S> man<S>376</S>, or that thou be a priest<S>3548</S> unto a tribe<S>7626</S> and a family<S>4940</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>?
And the priest's<S>3548</S> heart<S>3820</S> was glad<S>3190</S>, and he took<S>3947</S> the ephod<S>646</S>, and the teraphim<S>8655</S>, and the graven image<S>6459</S>, and went in<S>935</S> the midst<S>7130</S> of the people<S>5971</S>.
So they turned<S>6437</S> and departed<S>3212</S>, and put<S>7760</S> the little ones<S>2945</S> and the cattle<S>4735</S> and the carriage<S>3520</S> before<S>6440</S> them.
And when they were a good way<S>7368</S> from the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>, the men<S>582</S> that were in the houses<S>1004</S> near to Micah's<S>4318</S> house<S>1004</S> were gathered together<S>2199</S>, and overtook<S>1692</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S>.
And they cried<S>7121</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S>. And they turned<S>5437</S> their faces<S>6440</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto Micah<S>4318</S>, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company<S>2199</S>? <sup>comest: Heb. art gathered together?</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, Ye have taken away<S>3947</S> my gods<S>430</S> which I made<S>6213</S>, and the priest<S>3548</S>, and ye are gone away<S>3212</S>: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say<S>559</S> unto me, What aileth thee?
And the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Let not thy voice<S>6963</S> be heard<S>8085</S> among us, lest angry<S>4751</S> <S>5315</S> fellows<S>582</S> run<S>6293</S> upon thee, and thou lose<S>622</S> thy life<S>5315</S>, with the lives<S>5315</S> of thy household<S>1004</S>. <sup>angry: Heb. bitter of soul</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S> went<S>3212</S> their way<S>1870</S>: and when Micah<S>4318</S> saw<S>7200</S> that they were too strong<S>2389</S> for him, he turned<S>6437</S> and went back<S>7725</S> unto his house<S>1004</S>.
And they took<S>3947</S> the things which Micah<S>4318</S> had made<S>6213</S>, and the priest<S>3548</S> which he had, and came<S>935</S> unto Laish<S>3919</S>, unto a people<S>5971</S> that were at quiet<S>8252</S> and secure<S>982</S>: and they smote<S>5221</S> them with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> the city<S>5892</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
And there was no deliverer<S>5337</S>, because it was far<S>7350</S> from Zidon<S>6721</S>, and they had no business<S>1697</S> with any man<S>120</S>; and it was in the valley<S>6010</S> that lieth by Bethrehob<S>1050</S>. And they built<S>1129</S> a city<S>5892</S>, and dwelt<S>3427</S> therein.
And they called<S>7121</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the city<S>5892</S> Dan<S>1835</S>, after the name<S>8034</S> of Dan<S>1835</S> their father<S>1</S>, who was born<S>3205</S> unto Israel<S>3478</S>: howbeit<S>199</S> the name<S>8034</S> of the city<S>5892</S> was Laish<S>3919</S> at the first<S>7223</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Dan<S>1835</S> set up<S>6965</S> the graven image<S>6459</S>: and Jonathan<S>3083</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Gershom<S>1647</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, he and his sons<S>1121</S> were priests<S>3548</S> to the tribe<S>7626</S> of Dan<S>1839</S> until the day<S>3117</S> of the captivity<S>1540</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
And they set them up<S>7760</S> Micah's<S>4318</S> graven image<S>6459</S>, which he made<S>6213</S>, all the time<S>3117</S> that the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S> was in Shiloh<S>7887</S>.

Ephraim<S>669</S> feedeth<S>7462</S> on wind<S>7307</S>, and followeth<S>7291</S> after the east wind<S>6921</S>: he daily<S>3117</S> increaseth<S>7235</S> lies<S>3577</S> and desolation<S>7701</S>; and they do make<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with the Assyrians<S>804</S>, and oil<S>8081</S> is carried<S>2986</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> hath also a controversy<S>7379</S> with Judah<S>3063</S>, and will punish<S>6485</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> according to his ways<S>1870</S>; according to his doings<S>4611</S> will he recompense<S>7725</S> him. <sup>punish: Heb. visit upon</sup>
He took his brother<S>251</S> by the heel<S>6117</S> in the womb<S>990</S>, and by his strength<S>202</S> he had power<S>8280</S> with God<S>430</S>: <sup>had: Heb. was a prince, or, behaved himself princely</sup>
Yea, he had power<S>7786</S> over the angel<S>4397</S>, and prevailed<S>3201</S>: he wept<S>1058</S>, and made supplication<S>2603</S> unto him: he found<S>4672</S> him in Bethel<S>1008</S>, and there he spake<S>1696</S> with us;
Even the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>; the LORD<S>3068</S> is his memorial<S>2143</S>.
Therefore turn<S>7725</S> thou to thy God<S>430</S>: keep<S>8104</S> mercy<S>2617</S> and judgment<S>4941</S>, and wait<S>6960</S> on thy God<S>430</S> continually<S>8548</S>.
He is a merchant<S>3667</S>, the balances<S>3976</S> of deceit<S>4820</S> are in his hand<S>3027</S>: he loveth<S>157</S> to oppress<S>6231</S>. <sup>a merchant: or, Canaan</sup> <sup>oppress: or, deceive</sup>
And Ephraim<S>669</S> said<S>559</S>, Yet I am become rich<S>6238</S>, I have found me out<S>4672</S> substance<S>202</S>: in all my labours<S>3018</S> they shall find<S>4672</S> none iniquity<S>5771</S> in me that were sin<S>2399</S>. <sup>in all: or, all my labours suffice me not: he shall have punishment of iniquity in whom is sin</sup> <sup>that: Heb. which</sup>
And I that am the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> from the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> will yet make thee to dwell<S>3427</S> in tabernacles<S>168</S>, as in the days<S>3117</S> of the solemn feast<S>4150</S>.
I have also spoken<S>1696</S> by the prophets<S>5030</S>, and I have multiplied<S>7235</S> visions<S>2377</S>, and used similitudes<S>1819</S>, by the ministry<S>3027</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S>. <sup>ministry: Heb. hand</sup>
Is there iniquity<S>205</S> in Gilead<S>1568</S>? surely they are vanity<S>7723</S>: they sacrifice<S>2076</S> bullocks<S>7794</S> in Gilgal<S>1537</S>; yea, their altars<S>4196</S> are as heaps<S>1530</S> in the furrows<S>8525</S> of the fields<S>7704</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> fled<S>1272</S> into the country<S>7704</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, and Israel<S>3478</S> served<S>5647</S> for a wife<S>802</S>, and for a wife<S>802</S> he kept<S>8104</S> sheep.

Ephraim<S>669</S> provoked him to anger<S>3707</S> most bitterly<S>8563</S>: therefore shall he leave<S>5203</S> his blood<S>1818</S> upon him, and his reproach<S>2781</S> shall his Lord<S>113</S> return<S>7725</S> unto him. <sup>most: Heb. with bitternesses</sup> <sup>blood: Heb. bloods</sup>

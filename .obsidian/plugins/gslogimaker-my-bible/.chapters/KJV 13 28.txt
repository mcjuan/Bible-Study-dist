And David<S>1732</S> assembled<S>6950</S> all the princes<S>8269</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, the princes<S>8269</S> of the tribes<S>7626</S>, and the captains<S>8269</S> of the companies<S>4256</S> that ministered<S>8334</S> to the king<S>4428</S> by course<S>4256</S>, and the captains<S>8269</S> over the thousands<S>505</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> over the hundreds<S>3967</S>, and the stewards<S>8269</S> over all the substance<S>7399</S> and possession<S>4735</S> of the king<S>4428</S>, and of his sons<S>1121</S>, with the officers<S>5631</S>, and with the mighty men<S>1368</S>, and with all the valiant men<S>2428</S>, unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. <sup>possession: or, cattle</sup> <sup>and of: or, and his sons</sup> <sup>officers: or, eunuchs</sup>
Then David<S>1732</S> the king<S>4428</S> stood up<S>6965</S> upon his feet<S>7272</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> me, my brethren<S>251</S>, and my people<S>5971</S>: As for me, I had in mine heart<S>3824</S> to build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> of rest<S>4496</S> for the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and for the footstool<S>1916</S> <S>7272</S> of our God<S>430</S>, and had made ready<S>3559</S> for the building<S>1129</S>:
But God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Thou shalt not build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> for my name<S>8034</S>, because thou hast been a man<S>376</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and hast shed<S>8210</S> blood<S>1818</S>. <sup>blood: Heb. bloods</sup>
Howbeit the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> chose<S>977</S> me before all the house<S>1004</S> of my father<S>1</S> to be king<S>4428</S> over Israel<S>3478</S> for ever<S>5769</S>: for he hath chosen<S>977</S> Judah<S>3063</S> to be the ruler<S>5057</S>; and of the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, the house<S>1004</S> of my father<S>1</S>; and among the sons<S>1121</S> of my father<S>1</S> he liked<S>7521</S> me to make me king<S>4427</S> over all Israel<S>3478</S>:
And of all my sons<S>1121</S>, (for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> me many<S>7227</S> sons<S>1121</S>,) he hath chosen<S>977</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> my son<S>1121</S> to sit<S>3427</S> upon the throne<S>3678</S> of the kingdom<S>4438</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto me, Solomon<S>8010</S> thy son<S>1121</S>, he shall build<S>1129</S> my house<S>1004</S> and my courts<S>2691</S>: for I have chosen<S>977</S> him to be my son<S>1121</S>, and I will be his father<S>1</S>.
Moreover I will establish<S>3559</S> his kingdom<S>4438</S> for ever<S>5769</S>, if he be constant<S>2388</S> to do<S>6213</S> my commandments<S>4687</S> and my judgments<S>4941</S>, as at this day<S>3117</S>. <sup>constant: Heb. strong</sup>
Now therefore in the sight<S>5869</S> of all Israel<S>3478</S> the congregation<S>6951</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and in the audience<S>241</S> of our God<S>430</S>, keep<S>8104</S> and seek<S>1875</S> for all the commandments<S>4687</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>: that ye may possess<S>3423</S> this good<S>2896</S> land<S>776</S>, and leave it for an inheritance<S>5157</S> for your children<S>1121</S> after<S>310</S> you for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
And thou, Solomon<S>8010</S> my son<S>1121</S>, know<S>3045</S> thou the God<S>430</S> of thy father<S>1</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> him with a perfect<S>8003</S> heart<S>3820</S> and with a willing<S>2655</S> mind<S>5315</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> searcheth<S>1875</S> all hearts<S>3824</S>, and understandeth<S>995</S> all the imaginations<S>3336</S> of the thoughts<S>4284</S>: if thou seek<S>1875</S> him, he will be found<S>4672</S> of thee; but if thou forsake<S>5800</S> him, he will cast thee off<S>2186</S> for ever<S>5703</S>.
Take heed<S>7200</S> now; for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath chosen<S>977</S> thee to build<S>1129</S> an house<S>1004</S> for the sanctuary<S>4720</S>: be strong<S>2388</S>, and do<S>6213</S> it.
Then David<S>1732</S> gave<S>5414</S> to Solomon<S>8010</S> his son<S>1121</S> the pattern<S>8403</S> of the porch<S>197</S>, and of the houses<S>1004</S> thereof, and of the treasuries<S>1597</S> thereof, and of the upper chambers<S>5944</S> thereof, and of the inner<S>6442</S> parlours<S>2315</S> thereof, and of the place<S>1004</S> of the mercy seat<S>3727</S>,
And the pattern<S>8403</S> of all that he had by the spirit<S>7307</S>, of the courts<S>2691</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and of all the chambers<S>3957</S> round about<S>5439</S>, of the treasuries<S>214</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, and of the treasuries<S>214</S> of the dedicated things<S>6944</S>: <sup>of all that: Heb. of all that was with him</sup>
Also for the courses<S>4256</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>, and for all the work<S>4399</S> of the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and for all the vessels<S>3627</S> of service<S>5656</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
He gave of gold<S>2091</S> by weight<S>4948</S> for things of gold<S>2091</S>, for all instruments<S>3627</S> of all manner of service<S>5656</S>; silver also for all instruments<S>3627</S> of silver<S>3701</S> by weight<S>4948</S>, for all instruments<S>3627</S> of every kind of service<S>5656</S>:
Even the weight<S>4948</S> for the candlesticks<S>4501</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, and for their lamps<S>5216</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, by weight<S>4948</S> for every candlestick<S>4501</S>, and for the lamps<S>5216</S> thereof: and for the candlesticks<S>4501</S> of silver<S>3701</S> by weight<S>4948</S>, both for the candlestick<S>4501</S>, and also for the lamps<S>5216</S> thereof, according to the use<S>5656</S> of every candlestick<S>4501</S>.
And by weight<S>4948</S> he gave gold<S>2091</S> for the tables<S>7979</S> of shewbread<S>4635</S>, for every table<S>7979</S>; and likewise silver<S>3701</S> for the tables<S>7979</S> of silver<S>3701</S>:
Also pure<S>2889</S> gold<S>2091</S> for the fleshhooks<S>4207</S>, and the bowls<S>4219</S>, and the cups<S>7184</S>: and for the golden<S>2091</S> basons<S>3713</S> he gave gold by weight<S>4948</S> for every bason<S>3713</S>; and likewise silver by weight<S>4948</S> for every bason<S>3713</S> of silver<S>3701</S>:
And for the altar<S>4196</S> of incense<S>7004</S> refined<S>2212</S> gold<S>2091</S> by weight<S>4948</S>; and gold<S>2091</S> for the pattern<S>8403</S> of the chariot<S>4818</S> of the cherubims<S>3742</S>, that spread out<S>6566</S> their wings, and covered<S>5526</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
All this, said David, the LORD<S>3068</S> made me understand<S>7919</S> in writing<S>3791</S> by his hand<S>3027</S> upon me, even all the works<S>4399</S> of this pattern<S>8403</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> to Solomon<S>8010</S> his son<S>1121</S>, Be strong<S>2388</S> and of good courage<S>553</S>, and do<S>6213</S> it: fear<S>3372</S> not, nor be dismayed<S>2865</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S>, even my God<S>430</S>, will be with thee; he will not fail<S>7503</S> thee, nor forsake<S>5800</S> thee, until thou hast finished<S>3615</S> all the work<S>4399</S> for the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And, behold, the courses<S>4256</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>, even they shall be with thee for all the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship<S>4399</S> every willing<S>5081</S> skilful man<S>2451</S>, for any manner of service<S>5656</S>: also the princes<S>8269</S> and all the people<S>5971</S> will be wholly at thy commandment<S>1697</S>.

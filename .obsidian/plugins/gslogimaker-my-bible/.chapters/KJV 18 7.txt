Is there not an appointed time<S>6635</S> to man<S>582</S> upon earth<S>776</S>? are not his days<S>3117</S> also like the days<S>3117</S> of an hireling<S>7916</S>? <sup>an appointed: or, a warfare</sup>
As a servant<S>5650</S> earnestly desireth<S>7602</S> the shadow<S>6738</S>, and as an hireling<S>7916</S> looketh<S>6960</S> for the reward of his work<S>6467</S>: <sup>earnestly: Heb. gapeth after</sup>
So am I made to possess<S>5157</S> months<S>3391</S> of vanity<S>7723</S>, and wearisome<S>5999</S> nights<S>3915</S> are appointed<S>4487</S> to me.
When I lie down<S>7901</S>, I say<S>559</S>, When shall I arise<S>6965</S>, and the night<S>6153</S> be gone<S>4059</S>? and I am full<S>7646</S> of tossings to and fro<S>5076</S> unto the dawning of the day<S>5399</S>. <sup>the night: Heb. the evening be measured?</sup>
My flesh<S>1320</S> is clothed<S>3847</S> with worms<S>7415</S> and clods<S>1487</S> of dust<S>6083</S>; my skin<S>5785</S> is broken<S>7280</S>, and become loathsome<S>3988</S>.
My days<S>3117</S> are swifter<S>7043</S> than a weaver's shuttle<S>708</S>, and are spent<S>3615</S> without<S>657</S> hope<S>8615</S>.
O remember<S>2142</S> that my life<S>2416</S> is wind<S>7307</S>: mine eye<S>5869</S> shall no more<S>7725</S> see<S>7200</S> good<S>2896</S>. <sup>shall: Heb. shall not return</sup> <sup>see: to see, that is, to enjoy</sup>
The eye<S>5869</S> of him that hath seen<S>7210</S> me shall see<S>7789</S> me no more: thine eyes<S>5869</S> are upon me, and I am not. <sup>I am: that is, I can live no longer</sup>
As the cloud<S>6051</S> is consumed<S>3615</S> and vanisheth away<S>3212</S>: so he that goeth down<S>3381</S> to the grave<S>7585</S> shall come up<S>5927</S> no more.
He shall return<S>7725</S> no more to his house<S>1004</S>, neither shall his place<S>4725</S> know<S>5234</S> him any more.
Therefore I will not refrain<S>2820</S> my mouth<S>6310</S>; I will speak<S>1696</S> in the anguish<S>6862</S> of my spirit<S>7307</S>; I will complain<S>7878</S> in the bitterness<S>4751</S> of my soul<S>5315</S>.
Am I a sea<S>3220</S>, or a whale<S>8577</S>, that thou settest<S>7760</S> a watch<S>4929</S> over me?
When I say<S>559</S>, My bed<S>6210</S> shall comfort<S>5162</S> me, my couch<S>4904</S> shall ease<S>5375</S> my complaint<S>7879</S>;
Then thou scarest<S>2865</S> me with dreams<S>2472</S>, and terrifiest<S>1204</S> me through visions<S>2384</S>:
So that my soul<S>5315</S> chooseth<S>977</S> strangling<S>4267</S>, and death<S>4194</S> rather than my life<S>6106</S>. <sup>life: Heb. bones</sup>
I loathe<S>3988</S> it; I would not live<S>2421</S> alway<S>5769</S>: let me alone<S>2308</S>; for my days<S>3117</S> are vanity<S>1892</S>.
What is man<S>582</S>, that thou shouldest magnify<S>1431</S> him? and that thou shouldest set<S>7896</S> thine heart<S>3820</S> upon him?
And that thou shouldest visit<S>6485</S> him every morning<S>1242</S>, and try<S>974</S> him every moment<S>7281</S>?
How long<S>4100</S> wilt thou not depart<S>8159</S> from me, nor let me alone<S>7503</S> till I swallow down<S>1104</S> my spittle<S>7536</S>?
I have sinned<S>2398</S>; what shall I do<S>6466</S> unto thee, O thou preserver<S>5341</S> of men<S>120</S>? why hast thou set<S>7760</S> me as a mark<S>4645</S> against thee, so that I am a burden<S>4853</S> to myself?
And why dost thou not pardon<S>5375</S> my transgression<S>6588</S>, and take away<S>5674</S> mine iniquity<S>5771</S>? for now shall I sleep<S>7901</S> in the dust<S>6083</S>; and thou shalt seek me in the morning<S>7836</S>, but I shall not be.

And it came to pass in the month<S>2320</S> Nisan<S>5212</S>, in the twentieth<S>6242</S> year<S>8141</S> of Artaxerxes<S>783</S> the king<S>4428</S>, that wine<S>3196</S> was before<S>6440</S> him: and I took up<S>5375</S> the wine<S>3196</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> it unto the king<S>4428</S>. Now I had not been beforetime sad<S>7451</S> in his presence<S>6440</S>.
Wherefore the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Why is thy countenance<S>6440</S> sad<S>7451</S>, seeing thou art not sick<S>2470</S>? this is nothing else but sorrow<S>7455</S> of heart<S>3820</S>. Then I was very<S>3966</S> sore<S>7235</S> afraid<S>3372</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, Let the king<S>4428</S> live<S>2421</S> for ever<S>5769</S>: why should not my countenance<S>6440</S> be sad<S>3415</S>, when the city<S>5892</S>, the place<S>1004</S> of my fathers'<S>1</S> sepulchres<S>6913</S>, lieth waste<S>2720</S>, and the gates<S>8179</S> thereof are consumed<S>398</S> with fire<S>784</S>?
Then the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, For what dost thou make request<S>1245</S>? So I prayed<S>6419</S> to the God<S>430</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>.
And I said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, If it please<S>2895</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and if thy servant<S>5650</S> have found favour<S>3190</S> in thy sight<S>6440</S>, that thou wouldest send<S>7971</S> me unto Judah<S>3063</S>, unto the city<S>5892</S> of my fathers'<S>1</S> sepulchres<S>6913</S>, that I may build<S>1129</S> it.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, (the queen<S>7694</S> also sitting<S>3427</S> by him<S>681</S>,) For how long shall thy journey<S>4109</S> be? and when wilt thou return<S>7725</S>? So it pleased<S>3190</S> <S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> to send<S>7971</S> me; and I set<S>5414</S> him a time<S>2165</S>. <sup>queen: Heb. wife</sup>
Moreover I said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, If it please<S>2895</S> the king<S>4428</S>, let letters<S>107</S> be given<S>5414</S> me to the governors<S>6346</S> beyond<S>5676</S> the river<S>5104</S>, that they may convey me over<S>5674</S> till I come<S>935</S> into Judah<S>3063</S>;
And a letter<S>107</S> unto Asaph<S>623</S> the keeper<S>8104</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> forest<S>6508</S>, that he may give<S>5414</S> me timber<S>6086</S> to make beams<S>7136</S> for the gates<S>8179</S> of the palace<S>1002</S> which appertained to the house<S>1004</S>, and for the wall<S>2346</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and for the house<S>1004</S> that I shall enter into<S>935</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> granted<S>5414</S> me, according to the good<S>2896</S> hand<S>3027</S> of my God<S>430</S> upon me.
Then I came<S>935</S> to the governors<S>6346</S> beyond<S>5676</S> the river<S>5104</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> them the king's<S>4428</S> letters<S>107</S>. Now the king<S>4428</S> had sent<S>7971</S> captains<S>8269</S> of the army<S>2428</S> and horsemen<S>6571</S> with me.
When Sanballat<S>5571</S> the Horonite<S>2772</S>, and Tobiah<S>2900</S> the servant<S>5650</S>, the Ammonite<S>5984</S>, heard<S>8085</S> of it, it grieved<S>3415</S> them exceedingly<S>7451</S> <S>1419</S> that there was come<S>935</S> a man<S>120</S> to seek<S>1245</S> the welfare<S>2896</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
So I came<S>935</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and was there three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And I arose<S>6965</S> in the night<S>3915</S>, I and some<S>4592</S> few<S>4592</S> men<S>582</S> with me; neither told<S>5046</S> I any man<S>120</S> what my God<S>430</S> had put<S>5414</S> in my heart<S>3820</S> to do<S>6213</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: neither was there any beast<S>929</S> with me, save the beast<S>929</S> that I rode upon<S>7392</S>.
And I went out<S>3318</S> by night<S>3915</S> by the gate<S>8179</S> of the valley<S>1516</S>, even before<S>6440</S> the dragon<S>8577</S> well<S>5869</S> <S>5886</S>, and to the dung<S>830</S> port<S>8179</S>, and viewed<S>7663</S> <S>7665</S> the walls<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, which were broken down<S>6555</S>, and the gates<S>8179</S> thereof were consumed<S>398</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
Then I went on<S>5674</S> to the gate<S>8179</S> of the fountain<S>5869</S>, and to the king's<S>4428</S> pool<S>1295</S>: but there was no place<S>4725</S> for the beast<S>929</S> that was under me to pass<S>5674</S>.
Then went I up<S>5927</S> in the night<S>3915</S> by the brook<S>5158</S>, and viewed<S>7663</S> <S>7665</S> the wall<S>2346</S>, and turned back<S>7725</S>, and entered<S>935</S> by the gate<S>8179</S> of the valley<S>1516</S>, and so returned<S>7725</S>.
And the rulers<S>5461</S> knew<S>3045</S> not whither I went<S>1980</S>, or what I did<S>6213</S>; neither had I as yet<S>3651</S> told<S>5046</S> it to the Jews<S>3064</S>, nor to the priests<S>3548</S>, nor to the nobles<S>2715</S>, nor to the rulers<S>5461</S>, nor to the rest<S>3499</S> that did<S>6213</S> the work<S>4399</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> I unto them, Ye see<S>7200</S> the distress<S>7451</S> that we are in, how Jerusalem<S>3389</S> lieth waste<S>2720</S>, and the gates<S>8179</S> thereof are burned<S>3341</S> with fire<S>784</S>: come<S>3212</S>, and let us build up<S>1129</S> the wall<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, that we be no more a reproach<S>2781</S>.
Then I told<S>5046</S> them of the hand<S>3027</S> of my God<S>430</S> which was good<S>2896</S> upon me; as also the king's<S>4428</S> words<S>1697</S> that he had spoken<S>559</S> unto me. And they said<S>559</S>, Let us rise up<S>6965</S> and build<S>1129</S>. So they strengthened<S>2388</S> their hands<S>3027</S> for this good<S>2896</S> work.
But when Sanballat<S>5571</S> the Horonite<S>2772</S>, and Tobiah<S>2900</S> the servant<S>5650</S>, the Ammonite<S>5984</S>, and Geshem<S>1654</S> the Arabian<S>6163</S>, heard<S>8085</S> it, they laughed us to scorn<S>3932</S>, and despised<S>959</S> us, and said<S>559</S>, What is this thing<S>1697</S> that ye do<S>6213</S>? will ye rebel<S>4775</S> against the king<S>4428</S>?
Then answered<S>7725</S> <S>1697</S> I them, and said<S>559</S> unto them, The God<S>430</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, he will prosper<S>6743</S> us; therefore we his servants<S>5650</S> will arise<S>6965</S> and build<S>1129</S>: but ye have no portion<S>2506</S>, nor right<S>6666</S>, nor memorial<S>2146</S>, in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.

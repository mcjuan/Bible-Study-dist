So the king<S>4428</S> and Haman<S>2001</S> came<S>935</S> to banquet<S>8354</S> with Esther<S>635</S> the queen<S>4436</S>. <sup>to banquet: Heb. to drink</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> again unto Esther<S>635</S> on the second<S>8145</S> day<S>3117</S> at the banquet<S>4960</S> of wine<S>3196</S>, What is thy petition<S>7596</S>, queen<S>4436</S> Esther<S>635</S>? and it shall be granted<S>5414</S> thee: and what is thy request<S>1246</S>? and it shall be performed<S>6213</S>, even to the half<S>2677</S> of the kingdom<S>4438</S>.
Then Esther<S>635</S> the queen<S>4436</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, If I have found<S>4672</S> favour<S>2580</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>, O king<S>4428</S>, and if it please<S>2895</S> the king<S>4428</S>, let my life<S>5315</S> be given<S>5414</S> me at my petition<S>7596</S>, and my people<S>5971</S> at my request<S>1246</S>:
For we are sold<S>4376</S>, I and my people<S>5971</S>, to be destroyed<S>8045</S>, to be slain<S>2026</S>, and to perish<S>6</S>. But if<S>432</S> we had been sold<S>4376</S> for bondmen<S>5650</S> and bondwomen<S>8198</S>, I had held my tongue<S>2790</S>, although the enemy<S>6862</S> could not countervail<S>7737</S> the king's<S>4428</S> damage<S>5143</S>. <sup>to be destroyed: Heb. that they should destroy, and kill, and cause to perish</sup>
Then the king<S>4428</S> Ahasuerus<S>325</S> answered<S>559</S> and said<S>559</S> unto Esther<S>635</S> the queen<S>4436</S>, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume<S>4390</S> in his heart<S>3820</S> to do<S>6213</S> so? <sup>that: Heb. whose heart hath filled him</sup>
And Esther<S>635</S> said<S>559</S>, The adversary<S>376</S> <S>6862</S> and enemy<S>341</S> is this wicked<S>7451</S> Haman<S>2001</S>. Then Haman<S>2001</S> was afraid<S>1204</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> and the queen<S>4436</S>. <sup>The adversary: Heb. The man adversary</sup> <sup>before: or, at the presence of</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> arising<S>6965</S> from the banquet<S>4960</S> of wine<S>3196</S> in his wrath<S>2534</S> went into the palace<S>1055</S> garden<S>1594</S>: and Haman<S>2001</S> stood up<S>5975</S> to make request<S>1245</S> for his life<S>5315</S> to Esther<S>635</S> the queen<S>4436</S>; for he saw<S>7200</S> that there was evil<S>7451</S> determined<S>3615</S> against him by the king<S>4428</S>.
Then the king<S>4428</S> returned<S>7725</S> out of the palace<S>1055</S> garden<S>1594</S> into the place<S>1004</S> of the banquet<S>4960</S> of wine<S>3196</S>; and Haman<S>2001</S> was fallen<S>5307</S> upon the bed<S>4296</S> whereon Esther<S>635</S> was. Then said<S>559</S> the king<S>4428</S>, Will he force<S>3533</S> the queen<S>4436</S> also before me in the house<S>1004</S>? As the word<S>1697</S> went out<S>3318</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> mouth<S>6310</S>, they covered<S>2645</S> Haman's<S>2001</S> face<S>6440</S>. <sup>before me: Heb. with me</sup>
And Harbonah<S>2726</S>, one<S>259</S> of the chamberlains<S>5631</S>, said<S>559</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S>, Behold also, the gallows<S>6086</S> fifty<S>2572</S> cubits<S>520</S> high<S>1364</S>, which Haman<S>2001</S> had made<S>6213</S> for Mordecai<S>4782</S>, who had spoken<S>1696</S> good<S>2896</S> for the king<S>4428</S>, standeth<S>5975</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of Haman<S>2001</S>. Then the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Hang<S>8518</S> him thereon. <sup>gallows: Heb. tree</sup>
So they hanged<S>8518</S> Haman<S>2001</S> on the gallows<S>6086</S> that he had prepared<S>3559</S> for Mordecai<S>4782</S>. Then was the king's<S>4428</S> wrath<S>2534</S> pacified<S>7918</S>.

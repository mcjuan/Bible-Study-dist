A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>. Bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, O my soul<S>5315</S>: and all that is within<S>7130</S> me, bless his holy<S>6944</S> name<S>8034</S>.
Bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, O my soul<S>5315</S>, and forget<S>7911</S> not all his benefits<S>1576</S>:
Who forgiveth<S>5545</S> all thine iniquities<S>5771</S>; who healeth<S>7495</S> all thy diseases<S>8463</S>;
Who redeemeth<S>1350</S> thy life<S>2416</S> from destruction<S>7845</S>; who crowneth<S>5849</S> thee with lovingkindness<S>2617</S> and tender mercies<S>7356</S>;
Who satisfieth<S>7646</S> thy mouth<S>5716</S> with good<S>2896</S> things; so that thy youth<S>5271</S> is renewed<S>2318</S> like the eagle's<S>5404</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> executeth<S>6213</S> righteousness<S>6666</S> and judgment<S>4941</S> for all that are oppressed<S>6231</S>.
He made known<S>3045</S> his ways<S>1870</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, his acts<S>5949</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> is merciful<S>7349</S> and gracious<S>2587</S>, slow<S>750</S> to anger<S>639</S>, and plenteous<S>7227</S> in mercy<S>2617</S>. <sup>plentious: Heb. great in mercy</sup>
He will not always<S>5331</S> chide<S>7378</S>: neither will he keep<S>5201</S> his anger for ever<S>5769</S>.
He hath not dealt<S>6213</S> with us after our sins<S>2399</S>; nor rewarded<S>1580</S> us according to our iniquities<S>5771</S>.
For as the heaven<S>8064</S> is high above<S>1361</S> the earth<S>776</S>, so great<S>1396</S> is his mercy<S>2617</S> toward them that fear<S>3373</S> him. <sup>as: Heb. according to the height of the heaven</sup>
As far as<S>7368</S> the east<S>4217</S> is from the west<S>4628</S>, so far hath he removed<S>7368</S> our transgressions<S>6588</S> from us.
Like as a father<S>1</S> pitieth<S>7355</S> his children<S>1121</S>, so the LORD<S>3068</S> pitieth<S>7355</S> them that fear<S>3373</S> him.
For he knoweth<S>3045</S> our frame<S>3336</S>; he remembereth<S>2142</S> that we are dust<S>6083</S>.
As for man<S>582</S>, his days<S>3117</S> are as grass<S>2682</S>: as a flower<S>6731</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, so he flourisheth<S>6692</S>.
For the wind<S>7307</S> passeth over<S>5674</S> it, and it is gone; and the place<S>4725</S> thereof shall know<S>5234</S> it no more. <sup>it is: Heb. it is not</sup>
But the mercy<S>2617</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is from everlasting<S>5769</S> to<S>5704</S> everlasting<S>5769</S> upon them that fear<S>3373</S> him, and his righteousness<S>6666</S> unto children's<S>1121</S> children<S>1121</S>;
To such as keep<S>8104</S> his covenant<S>1285</S>, and to those that remember<S>2142</S> his commandments<S>6490</S> to do<S>6213</S> them.
The LORD<S>3068</S> hath prepared<S>3559</S> his throne<S>3678</S> in the heavens<S>8064</S>; and his kingdom<S>4438</S> ruleth<S>4910</S> over all.
Bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, ye his angels<S>4397</S>, that excel<S>1368</S> in strength<S>3581</S>, that do<S>6213</S> his commandments<S>1697</S>, hearkening<S>8085</S> unto the voice<S>6963</S> of his word<S>1697</S>. <sup>that excel: Heb. mighty in strength</sup>
Bless<S>1288</S> ye the LORD<S>3068</S>, all ye his hosts<S>6635</S>; ye ministers<S>8334</S> of his, that do<S>6213</S> his pleasure<S>7522</S>.
Bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, all his works<S>4639</S> in all places<S>4725</S> of his dominion<S>4475</S>: bless<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, O my soul<S>5315</S>.

Then came<S>935</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, even the whole congregation<S>5712</S>, into the desert<S>4057</S> of Zin<S>6790</S> in the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S>: and the people<S>5971</S> abode<S>3427</S> in Kadesh<S>6946</S>; and Miriam<S>4813</S> died<S>4191</S> there, and was buried<S>6912</S> there.
And there was no water<S>4325</S> for the congregation<S>5712</S>: and they gathered<S>6950</S> themselves together against Moses<S>4872</S> and against Aaron<S>175</S>.
And the people<S>5971</S> chode<S>7378</S> with Moses<S>4872</S>, and spake<S>559</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Would God that<S>3863</S> we had died<S>1478</S> when our brethren<S>251</S> died<S>1478</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>!
And why have ye brought up<S>935</S> the congregation<S>6951</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> into this wilderness<S>4057</S>, that we and our cattle<S>1165</S> should die<S>4191</S> there?
And wherefore have ye made us to come up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, to bring<S>935</S> us in unto this evil<S>7451</S> place<S>4725</S>? it is no place<S>4725</S> of seed<S>2233</S>, or of figs<S>8384</S>, or of vines<S>1612</S>, or of pomegranates<S>7416</S>; neither is there any water<S>4325</S> to drink<S>8354</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> went<S>935</S> from the presence<S>6440</S> of the assembly<S>6951</S> unto the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>, and they fell<S>5307</S> upon their faces<S>6440</S>: and the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> appeared<S>7200</S> unto them.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Take<S>3947</S> the rod<S>4294</S>, and gather<S>6950</S> thou the assembly<S>5712</S> together, thou, and Aaron<S>175</S> thy brother<S>251</S>, and speak<S>1696</S> ye unto the rock<S>5553</S> before their eyes<S>5869</S>; and it shall give forth<S>5414</S> his water<S>4325</S>, and thou shalt bring forth<S>3318</S> to them water<S>4325</S> out of the rock<S>5553</S>: so thou shalt give<S>8248</S> the congregation<S>5712</S> and their beasts<S>1165</S> drink<S>8248</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> the rod<S>4294</S> from before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, as he commanded<S>6680</S> him.
And Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> gathered<S>6950</S> the congregation<S>6951</S> together before<S>6440</S> the rock<S>5553</S>, and he said<S>559</S> unto them, Hear<S>8085</S> now, ye rebels<S>4784</S>; must we fetch<S>3318</S> you water<S>4325</S> out of this rock<S>5553</S>?
And Moses<S>4872</S> lifted up<S>7311</S> his hand<S>3027</S>, and with his rod<S>4294</S> he smote<S>5221</S> the rock<S>5553</S> twice<S>6471</S>: and the water<S>4325</S> came out<S>3318</S> abundantly<S>7227</S>, and the congregation<S>5712</S> drank<S>8354</S>, and their beasts<S>1165</S> also.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S>, Because ye believed<S>539</S> me not, to sanctify<S>6942</S> me in the eyes<S>5869</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, therefore ye shall not bring<S>935</S> this congregation<S>6951</S> into the land<S>776</S> which I have given<S>5414</S> them.
This is <S>1992</S> the water<S>4325</S> of Meribah<S>4809</S>; because the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> strove<S>7378</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S>, and he was sanctified<S>6942</S> in them. <sup>Meribah: that is, Strife</sup>
And Moses<S>4872</S> sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> from Kadesh<S>6946</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> of Edom<S>123</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> thy brother<S>251</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, Thou knowest<S>3045</S> all the travail<S>8513</S> that hath befallen<S>4672</S> us: <sup>befallen: Heb. found us</sup>
How our fathers<S>1</S> went down<S>3381</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>, and we have dwelt<S>3427</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S> a long<S>7227</S> time<S>3117</S>; and the Egyptians<S>4714</S> vexed<S>7489</S> us, and our fathers<S>1</S>:
And when we cried<S>6817</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, he heard<S>8085</S> our voice<S>6963</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> an angel<S>4397</S>, and hath brought us forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>: and, behold, we are in Kadesh<S>6946</S>, a city<S>5892</S> in the uttermost<S>7097</S> of thy border<S>1366</S>:
Let us pass<S>5674</S>, I pray thee, through thy country<S>776</S>: we will not pass<S>5674</S> through the fields<S>7704</S>, or through the vineyards<S>3754</S>, neither will we drink<S>8354</S> of the water<S>4325</S> of the wells<S>875</S>: we will go<S>3212</S> by the king's<S>4428</S> high way<S>1870</S>, we will not turn<S>5186</S> to the right hand<S>3225</S> nor to the left<S>8040</S>, until we have passed<S>5674</S> thy borders<S>1366</S>.
And Edom<S>123</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Thou shalt not pass<S>5674</S> by me, lest I come out<S>3318</S> against<S>7125</S> thee with the sword<S>2719</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, We will go<S>5927</S> by the high way<S>4546</S>: and if I and my cattle<S>4735</S> drink<S>8354</S> of thy water<S>4325</S>, then I will pay<S>5414</S> <S>4377</S> for it: I will only, without doing any thing<S>1697</S> else, go through<S>5674</S> on my feet<S>7272</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Thou shalt not go through<S>5674</S>. And Edom<S>123</S> came out<S>3318</S> against<S>7125</S> him with much<S>3515</S> people<S>5971</S>, and with a strong<S>2389</S> hand<S>3027</S>.
Thus Edom<S>123</S> refused<S>3985</S> to give<S>5414</S> Israel<S>3478</S> passage<S>5674</S> through his border<S>1366</S>: wherefore Israel<S>3478</S> turned away<S>5186</S> from him.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, even the whole congregation<S>5712</S>, journeyed<S>5265</S> from Kadesh<S>6946</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto mount<S>2022</S> Hor<S>2023</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> and Aaron<S>175</S> in mount<S>2022</S> Hor<S>2023</S>, by the coast<S>1366</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Edom<S>123</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Aaron<S>175</S> shall be gathered<S>622</S> unto his people<S>5971</S>: for he shall not enter<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> which I have given<S>5414</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, because ye rebelled against<S>4784</S> my word<S>6310</S> at the water<S>4325</S> of Meribah<S>4809</S>. <sup>word: Heb. mouth</sup>
Take<S>3947</S> Aaron<S>175</S> and Eleazar<S>499</S> his son<S>1121</S>, and bring them up<S>5927</S> unto mount<S>2022</S> Hor<S>2023</S>:
And strip<S>6584</S> Aaron<S>175</S> of his garments<S>899</S>, and put<S>3847</S> them upon Eleazar<S>499</S> his son<S>1121</S>: and Aaron<S>175</S> shall be gathered<S>622</S> unto his people, and shall die<S>4191</S> there.
And Moses<S>4872</S> did<S>6213</S> as the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>: and they went up<S>5927</S> into mount<S>2022</S> Hor<S>2023</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of all the congregation<S>5712</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> stripped<S>6584</S> Aaron<S>175</S> of his garments<S>899</S>, and put<S>3847</S> them upon Eleazar<S>499</S> his son<S>1121</S>; and Aaron<S>175</S> died<S>4191</S> there in the top<S>7218</S> of the mount<S>2022</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> and Eleazar<S>499</S> came down<S>3381</S> from the mount<S>2022</S>.
And when all the congregation<S>5712</S> saw<S>7200</S> that Aaron<S>175</S> was dead<S>1478</S>, they mourned<S>1058</S> for Aaron<S>175</S> thirty<S>7970</S> days<S>3117</S>, even all the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.

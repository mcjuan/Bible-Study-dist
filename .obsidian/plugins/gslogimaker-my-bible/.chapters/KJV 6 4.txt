And it came to pass, when all the people<S>1471</S> were clean<S>8552</S> passed over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, that the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Take<S>3947</S> you twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> men<S>582</S> out of the people<S>5971</S>, out of every<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S> a man<S>376</S>,
And command<S>6680</S> ye them, saying<S>559</S>, Take<S>5375</S> you hence out of the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, out of the place where the priests'<S>3548</S> feet<S>7272</S> stood<S>4673</S> firm<S>3559</S>, twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> stones<S>68</S>, and ye shall carry them over<S>5674</S> with you, and leave<S>3240</S> them in the lodging place<S>4411</S>, where ye shall lodge<S>3885</S> this night<S>3915</S>.
Then Joshua<S>3091</S> called<S>7121</S> the twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> men<S>376</S>, whom he had prepared<S>3559</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, out of every<S>259</S> tribe<S>7626</S> a man<S>376</S>:
And Joshua<S>3091</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Pass over<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, and take ye up<S>7311</S> every<S>259</S> man<S>376</S> of you a stone<S>68</S> upon his shoulder<S>7926</S>, according unto the number<S>4557</S> of the tribes<S>7626</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:
That this may be a sign<S>226</S> among<S>7130</S> you, that when your children<S>1121</S> ask<S>7592</S> their fathers in time to come<S>4279</S>, saying<S>559</S>, What mean ye by these stones<S>68</S>? <sup>in time: Heb. to morrow</sup>
Then ye shall answer<S>559</S> them, That the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> were cut off<S>3772</S> before<S>6440</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; when it passed over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> were cut off<S>3772</S>: and these stones<S>68</S> shall be for a memorial<S>2146</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> so as Joshua<S>3091</S> commanded<S>6680</S>, and took up<S>5375</S> twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> stones<S>68</S> out of the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, according to the number<S>4557</S> of the tribes<S>7626</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and carried them over<S>5674</S> with them unto the place where they lodged<S>4411</S>, and laid them down<S>3240</S> there.
And Joshua<S>3091</S> set up<S>6965</S> twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> stones<S>68</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, in the place where the feet<S>7272</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> which bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> stood<S>4673</S>: and they are there unto this day<S>3117</S>.
For the priests<S>3548</S> which bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> stood<S>5975</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, until every thing<S>1697</S> was finished<S>8552</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Joshua<S>3091</S> to speak<S>1696</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, according to all that Moses<S>4872</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>: and the people<S>5971</S> hasted<S>4116</S> and passed over<S>5674</S>.
And it came to pass, when all the people<S>5971</S> were clean<S>8552</S> passed over<S>5674</S>, that the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> passed over<S>5674</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S>, in the presence<S>6440</S> of the people<S>5971</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Reuben<S>7205</S>, and the children<S>1121</S> of Gad<S>1410</S>, and half<S>2677</S> the tribe<S>7626</S> of Manasseh<S>4519</S>, passed over<S>5674</S> armed<S>2571</S> before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, as Moses<S>4872</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto them:
About forty<S>705</S> thousand<S>505</S> prepared<S>2502</S> for war<S>6635</S> passed over<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> unto battle<S>4421</S>, to the plains<S>6160</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S>. <sup>prepared: or, ready armed</sup>
On that day<S>3117</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> magnified<S>1431</S> Joshua<S>3091</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of all Israel<S>3478</S>; and they feared<S>3372</S> him, as they feared<S>3372</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, all the days<S>3117</S> of his life<S>2416</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
Command<S>6680</S> the priests<S>3548</S> that bear<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the testimony<S>5715</S>, that they come up<S>5927</S> out of Jordan<S>3383</S>.
Joshua<S>3091</S> therefore commanded<S>6680</S> the priests<S>3548</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Come ye up<S>5927</S> out of Jordan<S>3383</S>.
And it came to pass, when the priests<S>3548</S> that bare<S>5375</S> the ark<S>727</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> were come up<S>5927</S> out of the midst<S>8432</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, and the soles<S>3709</S> of the priests'<S>3548</S> feet<S>7272</S> were lifted up<S>5423</S> unto the dry land<S>2724</S>, that the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> returned<S>7725</S> unto their place<S>4725</S>, and flowed<S>3212</S> over all his banks<S>1415</S>, as<S>8543</S> they did before<S>8032</S>. <sup>lifted: Heb. plucked up</sup> <sup>flowed: Heb. went</sup>
And the people<S>5971</S> came up<S>5927</S> out of Jordan<S>3383</S> on the tenth<S>6218</S> day of the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S>, and encamped<S>2583</S> in Gilgal<S>1537</S>, in the east<S>4217</S> border<S>7097</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S>.
And those twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> stones<S>68</S>, which they took out<S>3947</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, did Joshua<S>3091</S> pitch<S>6965</S> in Gilgal<S>1537</S>.
And he spake<S>559</S> unto the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, When your children<S>1121</S> shall ask<S>7592</S> their fathers<S>1</S> in time to come<S>4279</S>, saying<S>559</S>, What mean these stones<S>68</S>? <sup>in time: Heb. to morrow</sup>
Then ye shall let your children<S>1121</S> know<S>3045</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Israel<S>3478</S> came over<S>5674</S> this Jordan<S>3383</S> on dry land<S>3004</S>.
For the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> dried up<S>3001</S> the waters<S>4325</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S> from before<S>6440</S> you, until ye were passed over<S>5674</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> did<S>6213</S> to the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S>, which he dried up<S>3001</S> from before<S>6440</S> us, until we were gone over<S>5674</S>:
That all the people<S>5971</S> of the earth<S>776</S> might know<S>3045</S> the hand<S>3027</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, that it is mighty<S>2389</S>: that ye might fear<S>3372</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S> for ever<S>3117</S>. <sup>for ever: Heb. all days</sup>

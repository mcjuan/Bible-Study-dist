Then there was a famine<S>7458</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of David<S>1732</S> three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S>, year<S>8141</S> after<S>310</S> year<S>8141</S>; and David<S>1732</S> enquired<S>1245</S> of<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> answered<S>559</S>, It is for Saul<S>7586</S>, and for his bloody<S>1818</S> house<S>1004</S>, because he slew<S>4191</S> the Gibeonites<S>1393</S>. <sup>enquired: Heb. sought the face, etc</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> called<S>7121</S> the Gibeonites<S>1393</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them; (now the Gibeonites<S>1393</S> were not of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, but of the remnant<S>3499</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>; and the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> had sworn<S>7650</S> unto them: and Saul<S>7586</S> sought<S>1245</S> to slay<S>5221</S> them in his zeal<S>7065</S> to the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and Judah<S>3063</S>.)
Wherefore David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto the Gibeonites<S>1393</S>, What shall I do<S>6213</S> for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement<S>3722</S>, that ye may bless<S>1288</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>?
And the Gibeonites<S>1393</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, We will have no silver<S>3701</S> nor gold<S>2091</S> of<S>5973</S> Saul<S>7586</S>, nor of his house<S>1004</S>; neither for us shalt thou kill<S>4191</S> any man<S>376</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, What ye shall say<S>559</S>, that will I do<S>6213</S> for you. <sup>We will: or, It is not silver nor gold that we have to do with Saul or his house, neither pertains it to us to kill, etc</sup>
And they answered<S>559</S> the king<S>4428</S>, The man<S>376</S> that consumed<S>3615</S> us, and that devised<S>1819</S> against us that we should be destroyed<S>8045</S> from remaining<S>3320</S> in any of the coasts<S>1366</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, <sup>devised: or, cut us off</sup>
Let seven<S>7651</S> men<S>582</S> of his sons<S>1121</S> be delivered<S>5414</S> unto us, and we will hang them up<S>3363</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> in Gibeah<S>1390</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, whom the LORD<S>3068</S> did choose<S>972</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, I will give<S>5414</S> them. <sup>whom: or, chosen of the LORD</sup>
But the king<S>4428</S> spared<S>2550</S> Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, because of the LORD'S<S>3068</S> oath<S>7621</S> that was between them, between David<S>1732</S> and Jonathan<S>3083</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>.
But the king<S>4428</S> took<S>3947</S> the two<S>8147</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Rizpah<S>7532</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Aiah<S>345</S>, whom she bare<S>3205</S> unto Saul<S>7586</S>, Armoni<S>764</S> and Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>; and the five<S>2568</S> sons<S>1121</S> of Michal<S>4324</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, whom she brought up<S>3205</S> for Adriel<S>5741</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Barzillai<S>1271</S> the Meholathite<S>4259</S>: <sup>Michal: or, Michal's sister</sup> <sup>brought: Heb. bare to Adriel</sup>
And he delivered<S>5414</S> them into the hands<S>3027</S> of the Gibeonites<S>1393</S>, and they hanged<S>3363</S> them in the hill<S>2022</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and they fell<S>5307</S> all seven<S>7651</S> <S>7659</S> together<S>3162</S>, and were put to death<S>4191</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of harvest<S>7105</S>, in the first<S>7223</S> days, in the beginning<S>8462</S> of barley<S>8184</S> harvest<S>7105</S>.
And Rizpah<S>7532</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Aiah<S>345</S> took<S>3947</S> sackcloth<S>8242</S>, and spread<S>5186</S> it for her upon the rock<S>6697</S>, from the beginning<S>8462</S> of harvest<S>7105</S> until water<S>4325</S> dropped<S>5413</S> upon them out of heaven<S>8064</S>, and suffered<S>5414</S> neither the birds<S>5775</S> of the air<S>8064</S> to rest<S>5117</S> on them by day<S>3119</S>, nor the beasts<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S> by night<S>3915</S>.
And it was told<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S> what Rizpah<S>7532</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Aiah<S>345</S>, the concubine<S>6370</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, had done<S>6213</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> went<S>3212</S> and took<S>3947</S> the bones<S>6106</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> and the bones<S>6106</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S> his son<S>1121</S> from the men<S>1167</S> of Jabeshgilead<S>3003</S> <S>1568</S>, which had stolen<S>1589</S> them from the street<S>7339</S> of Bethshan<S>1052</S>, where the Philistines<S>6430</S> had hanged<S>8511</S> <S>8518</S> them, when<S>3117</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S> had slain<S>5221</S> Saul<S>7586</S> in Gilboa<S>1533</S>:
And he brought up<S>5927</S> from thence the bones<S>6106</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> and the bones<S>6106</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S> his son<S>1121</S>; and they gathered<S>622</S> the bones<S>6106</S> of them that were hanged<S>3363</S>.
And the bones<S>6106</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> and Jonathan<S>3083</S> his son<S>1121</S> buried<S>6912</S> they in the country<S>776</S> of Benjamin<S>1144</S> in Zelah<S>6762</S>, in the sepulchre<S>6913</S> of Kish<S>7027</S> his father<S>1</S>: and they performed<S>6213</S> all that the king<S>4428</S> commanded<S>6680</S>. And after<S>310</S> that God<S>430</S> was intreated<S>6279</S> for the land<S>776</S>.
Moreover the Philistines<S>6430</S> had yet war<S>4421</S> again with Israel<S>3478</S>; and David<S>1732</S> went down<S>3381</S>, and his servants<S>5650</S> with him, and fought<S>3898</S> against the Philistines<S>6430</S>: and David<S>1732</S> waxed faint<S>5774</S>.
And Ishbibenob<S>3430</S>, which was of the sons<S>3211</S> of the giant<S>7497</S>, the weight<S>4948</S> of whose spear<S>7013</S> weighed three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> shekels of brass<S>5178</S> in weight<S>4948</S>, he being girded<S>2296</S> with a new<S>2319</S> sword, thought<S>559</S> to have slain<S>5221</S> David<S>1732</S>. <sup>the giant: or, Rapha</sup> <sup>spear: Heb. the staff, or, the head</sup>
But Abishai<S>52</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zeruiah<S>6870</S> succoured<S>5826</S> him, and smote<S>5221</S> the Philistine<S>6430</S>, and killed<S>4191</S> him. Then the men<S>582</S> of David<S>1732</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, Thou shalt go<S>3318</S> no more out with us to battle<S>4421</S>, that thou quench<S>3518</S> not the light<S>5216</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>light: Heb. candle, or, lamp</sup>
And it came to pass after this<S>310</S>, that there was again a battle<S>4421</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S> at Gob<S>1359</S>: then Sibbechai<S>5444</S> the Hushathite<S>2843</S> slew<S>5221</S> Saph<S>5593</S>, which was of the sons<S>3211</S> of the giant<S>7497</S>. <sup>the giant: or, Rapha</sup> <sup>Saph: or, Sippai</sup>
And there was again a battle<S>4421</S> in Gob<S>1359</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>, where Elhanan<S>445</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jaareoregim<S>3296</S>, a Bethlehemite<S>1022</S>, slew<S>5221</S> the brother of Goliath<S>1555</S> the Gittite<S>1663</S>, the staff<S>6086</S> of whose spear<S>2595</S> was like a weaver's<S>707</S> beam<S>4500</S>. <sup>Jaareoregim: or, Jair</sup>
And there was yet a battle<S>4421</S> in Gath<S>1661</S>, where was a man<S>376</S> of great stature<S>4067</S> <S>4055</S>, that had on every hand<S>3027</S> six<S>8337</S> fingers<S>676</S>, and on every foot<S>7272</S> six<S>8337</S> toes<S>676</S>, four<S>702</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> in number<S>4557</S>; and he also was born<S>3205</S> to the giant<S>7497</S>. <sup>the giant: or, Rapha</sup>
And when he defied<S>2778</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, Jonathan<S>3083</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Shimea<S>8092</S> the brother<S>251</S> of David<S>1732</S> slew<S>5221</S> him. <sup>defied: or, reproached</sup>
These four<S>702</S> were born<S>3205</S> to the giant<S>7497</S> in Gath<S>1661</S>, and fell<S>5307</S> by the hand<S>3027</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and by the hand<S>3027</S> of his servants<S>5650</S>.

And Abram<S>87</S> went up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, he, and his wife<S>802</S>, and all that he had, and Lot<S>3876</S> with him, into the south<S>5045</S>.
And Abram<S>87</S> was very<S>3966</S> rich<S>3513</S> in cattle<S>4735</S>, in silver<S>3701</S>, and in gold<S>2091</S>.
And he went<S>3212</S> on his journeys<S>4550</S> from the south<S>5045</S> even to Bethel<S>1008</S>, unto the place<S>4725</S> where his tent<S>168</S> had been<S>1961</S> at the beginning<S>8462</S>, between Bethel<S>1008</S> and Hai<S>5857</S>;
Unto the place<S>4725</S> of the altar<S>4196</S>, which he had made<S>6213</S> there at the first<S>7223</S>: and there Abram<S>87</S> called<S>7121</S> on the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Lot<S>3876</S> also, which went<S>1980</S> with<S>854</S> Abram<S>87</S>, had flocks<S>6629</S>, and herds<S>1241</S>, and tents<S>168</S>.
And the land<S>776</S> was not able to bear<S>5375</S> them, that they might dwell<S>3427</S> together<S>3162</S>: for their substance<S>7399</S> was great<S>7227</S>, so that they could<S>3201</S> not dwell<S>3427</S> together<S>3162</S>.
And there was a strife<S>7379</S> between the herdmen<S>7462</S> of Abram's<S>87</S> cattle<S>4735</S> and the herdmen<S>7462</S> of Lot's<S>3876</S> cattle<S>4735</S>: and the Canaanite<S>3669</S> and the Perizzite<S>6522</S> dwelled<S>3427</S> then in the land<S>776</S>.
And Abram<S>87</S> said<S>559</S> unto Lot<S>3876</S>, Let there be<S>1961</S> no<S>408</S> strife<S>4808</S>, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen<S>7462</S> and thy herdmen<S>7462</S>; for we<S>582</S> be brethren<S>251</S>. <sup>brethren: Heb. men brethren</sup>
Is not the whole land<S>776</S> before thee<S>6440</S>? separate thyself<S>6504</S>, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand<S>8040</S>, then I will go to the right<S>3231</S>; or if thou depart to the right hand<S>3225</S>, then I will go to the left<S>8041</S>.
And Lot<S>3876</S> lifted up<S>5375</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>, and beheld<S>7200</S> all the plain<S>3603</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>, that it was well watered<S>4945</S> every where, before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> destroyed<S>7843</S> Sodom<S>5467</S> and Gomorrah<S>6017</S>, even as the garden<S>1588</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, like the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, as thou comest<S>935</S> unto Zoar<S>6820</S>.
Then Lot<S>3876</S> chose<S>977</S> him all the plain<S>3603</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>; and Lot<S>3876</S> journeyed<S>5265</S> east<S>6924</S>: and they separated themselves<S>6504</S> the one<S>376</S> from the other<S>251</S>.
Abram<S>87</S> dwelled<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, and Lot<S>3876</S> dwelled<S>3427</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of the plain<S>3603</S>, and pitched his tent<S>167</S> toward<S>5704</S> Sodom<S>5467</S>.
But the men<S>582</S> of Sodom<S>5467</S> were wicked<S>7451</S> and sinners<S>2400</S> before the LORD<S>3068</S> exceedingly<S>3966</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Abram<S>87</S>, after<S>310</S> that Lot<S>3876</S> was separated<S>6504</S> from him, Lift up<S>5375</S> now thine eyes<S>5869</S>, and look<S>7200</S> from the place<S>4725</S> where thou art northward<S>6828</S>, and southward<S>5045</S>, and eastward<S>6924</S>, and westward<S>3220</S>:
For all the land<S>776</S> which thou seest<S>7200</S>, to thee will I give it<S>5414</S>, and to thy seed<S>2233</S> for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
And I will make<S>7760</S> thy seed<S>2233</S> as the dust<S>6083</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: so that<S>834</S> if a man<S>376</S> can<S>3201</S> number<S>4487</S> the dust<S>6083</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, then shall thy seed<S>2233</S> also be numbered<S>4487</S>.
Arise<S>6965</S>, walk<S>1980</S> through the land<S>776</S> in the length<S>753</S> of it and in the breadth<S>7341</S> of it; for I will give<S>5414</S> it unto thee.
Then Abram<S>87</S> removed his tent<S>167</S>, and came<S>935</S> and dwelt<S>3427</S> in the plain<S>436</S> of Mamre<S>4471</S>, which is in Hebron<S>2275</S>, and built<S>1129</S> there an altar<S>4196</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>plain: Heb. plains</sup>

After two days<S>3117</S> will he revive<S>2421</S> us: in the third<S>7992</S> day<S>3117</S> he will raise us up<S>6965</S>, and we shall live<S>2421</S> in his sight<S>6440</S>.
Then shall we know<S>3045</S>, if we follow<S>7291</S> on to know<S>3045</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: his going forth<S>4161</S> is prepared<S>3559</S> as the morning<S>7837</S>; and he shall come<S>935</S> unto us as the rain<S>1653</S>, as the latter<S>4456</S> and former rain<S>3384</S> unto the earth<S>776</S>.
O Ephraim<S>669</S>, what shall I do<S>6213</S> unto thee?

Therefore have I hewed<S>2672</S> them by the prophets<S>5030</S>; I have slain<S>2026</S> them by the words<S>561</S> of my mouth<S>6310</S>: and thy judgments<S>4941</S> are as the light<S>216</S> that goeth forth<S>3318</S>. <sup>and: or, that thy judgments might be, etc</sup>
For I desired<S>2654</S> mercy<S>2617</S>, and not sacrifice<S>2077</S>; and the knowledge<S>1847</S> of God<S>430</S> more than burnt offerings<S>5930</S>.
But they like men<S>120</S> have transgressed<S>5674</S> the covenant<S>1285</S>: there have they dealt treacherously<S>898</S> against me. <sup>men: or, Adam</sup>

And as troops<S>1416</S> of robbers wait<S>2442</S> for a man<S>376</S>, so the company<S>2267</S> of priests<S>3548</S> murder<S>7523</S> in the way<S>1870</S> by consent<S>7926</S> <S>7927</S>: for they commit<S>6213</S> lewdness<S>2154</S>. <sup>by: Heb. with one shoulder, or, to Shechem</sup> <sup>lewdness: or, enormity</sup>
I have seen<S>7200</S> an horrible thing<S>8186</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: there is the whoredom<S>2184</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, Israel<S>3478</S> is defiled<S>2930</S>.
Also, O Judah<S>3063</S>, he hath set<S>7896</S> an harvest<S>7105</S> for thee, when I returned<S>7725</S> the captivity<S>7622</S> of my people<S>5971</S>.

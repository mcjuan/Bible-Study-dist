To the chief Musician<S>5329</S>, A Psalm<S>4210</S> of David<S>1732</S>. Hold not thy peace<S>2790</S>, O God<S>430</S> of my praise<S>8416</S>;
For the mouth<S>6310</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S> and the mouth<S>6310</S> of the deceitful<S>4820</S> are opened<S>6605</S> against me: they have spoken<S>1696</S> against me with a lying<S>8267</S> tongue<S>3956</S>. <sup>of the deceitful: Heb. of deceit</sup> <sup>are opened: Heb. have opened themselves</sup>
They compassed<S>5437</S> me about also with words<S>1697</S> of hatred<S>8135</S>; and fought<S>3898</S> against me without a cause<S>2600</S>.
For my love<S>160</S> they are my adversaries<S>7853</S>: but I give myself unto prayer<S>8605</S>.
And they have rewarded<S>7760</S> me evil<S>7451</S> for good<S>2896</S>, and hatred<S>8135</S> for my love<S>160</S>.
Set<S>6485</S> thou a wicked man<S>7563</S> over him: and let Satan<S>7854</S> stand<S>5975</S> at his right hand<S>3225</S>. <sup>Satan: or, an adversary</sup>
When he shall be judged<S>8199</S>, let him be<S>3318</S> condemned<S>7563</S>: and let his prayer<S>8605</S> become sin<S>2401</S>. <sup>be condemned: Heb. go out guilty, or, wicked</sup>
Let his days<S>3117</S> be few<S>4592</S>; and let another<S>312</S> take<S>3947</S> his office<S>6486</S>. <sup>office: or, charge</sup>
Let his children<S>1121</S> be fatherless<S>3490</S>, and his wife<S>802</S> a widow<S>490</S>.
Let his children<S>1121</S> be continually<S>5128</S> vagabonds<S>5128</S>, and beg<S>7592</S>: let them seek<S>1875</S> their bread also out of their desolate places<S>2723</S>.
Let the extortioner<S>5383</S> catch<S>5367</S> all that he hath; and let the strangers<S>2114</S> spoil<S>962</S> his labour<S>3018</S>.
Let there be none to extend<S>4900</S> mercy<S>2617</S> unto him: neither let there be any to favour<S>2603</S> his fatherless children<S>3490</S>.
Let his posterity<S>319</S> be cut off<S>3772</S>; and in the generation<S>1755</S> following<S>312</S> let their name<S>8034</S> be blotted out<S>4229</S>.
Let the iniquity<S>5771</S> of his fathers<S>1</S> be remembered<S>2142</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S>; and let not the sin<S>2403</S> of his mother<S>517</S> be blotted out<S>4229</S>.
Let them be before the LORD<S>3068</S> continually<S>8548</S>, that he may cut off<S>3772</S> the memory<S>2143</S> of them from the earth<S>776</S>.
Because that he remembered<S>2142</S> not to shew<S>6213</S> mercy<S>2617</S>, but persecuted<S>7291</S> the poor<S>6041</S> and needy<S>34</S> man<S>376</S>, that he might even slay<S>4191</S> the broken<S>3512</S> in heart<S>3824</S>.
As he loved<S>157</S> cursing<S>7045</S>, so let it come<S>935</S> unto him: as he delighted<S>2654</S> not in blessing<S>1293</S>, so let it be far<S>7368</S> from him.
As he clothed<S>3847</S> himself with cursing<S>7045</S> like as with his garment<S>4055</S>, so let it come<S>935</S> into his bowels<S>7130</S> like water<S>4325</S>, and like oil<S>8081</S> into his bones<S>6106</S>. <sup>into his bowels: Heb. within him</sup>
Let it be unto him as the garment<S>899</S> which covereth<S>5844</S> him, and for a girdle<S>4206</S> wherewith he is girded<S>2296</S> continually<S>8548</S>.
Let this be the reward<S>6468</S> of mine adversaries<S>7853</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, and of them that speak<S>1696</S> evil<S>7451</S> against my soul<S>5315</S>.
But do<S>6213</S> thou for me, O GOD<S>3069</S> the Lord<S>136</S>, for thy name's<S>8034</S> sake: because thy mercy<S>2617</S> is good<S>2896</S>, deliver<S>5337</S> thou me.
For I am poor<S>6041</S> and needy<S>34</S>, and my heart<S>3820</S> is wounded<S>2490</S> within<S>7130</S> me.
I am gone<S>1980</S> like the shadow<S>6738</S> when it declineth<S>5186</S>: I am tossed up and down<S>5287</S> as the locust<S>697</S>.
My knees<S>1290</S> are weak<S>3782</S> through fasting<S>6685</S>; and my flesh<S>1320</S> faileth<S>3584</S> of fatness<S>8081</S>.
I became also a reproach<S>2781</S> unto them: when they looked<S>7200</S> upon me they shaked<S>5128</S> their heads<S>7218</S>.
Help<S>5826</S> me, O LORD<S>3068</S> my God<S>430</S>: O save<S>3467</S> me according to thy mercy<S>2617</S>:
That they may know<S>3045</S> that this is thy hand<S>3027</S>; that thou, LORD<S>3068</S>, hast done<S>6213</S> it.
Let them curse<S>7043</S>, but bless<S>1288</S> thou: when they arise<S>6965</S>, let them be ashamed<S>954</S>; but let thy servant<S>5650</S> rejoice<S>8055</S>.
Let mine adversaries<S>7853</S> be clothed<S>3847</S> with shame<S>3639</S>, and let them cover<S>5844</S> themselves with their own confusion<S>1322</S>, as with a mantle<S>4598</S>.
I will greatly<S>3966</S> praise<S>3034</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> with my mouth<S>6310</S>; yea, I will praise<S>1984</S> him among<S>8432</S> the multitude<S>7227</S>.
For he shall stand<S>5975</S> at the right hand<S>3225</S> of the poor<S>34</S>, to save<S>3467</S> him from those that condemn<S>8199</S> his soul<S>5315</S>. <sup>those: Heb. the judges of</sup>

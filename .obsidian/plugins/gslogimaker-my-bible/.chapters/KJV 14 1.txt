And Solomon<S>8010</S> the son<S>1121</S> of David<S>1732</S> was strengthened<S>2388</S> in his kingdom<S>4438</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S> was with him, and magnified<S>1431</S> him exceedingly<S>4605</S>.
Then Solomon<S>8010</S> spake<S>559</S> unto all Israel<S>3478</S>, to the captains<S>8269</S> of thousands<S>505</S> and of hundreds<S>3967</S>, and to the judges<S>8199</S>, and to every governor<S>5387</S> in all Israel<S>3478</S>, the chief<S>7218</S> of the fathers<S>1</S>.
So Solomon<S>8010</S>, and all the congregation<S>6951</S> with him, went<S>3212</S> to the high place<S>1116</S> that was at Gibeon<S>1391</S>; for there was the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S> of God<S>430</S>, which Moses<S>4872</S> the servant<S>5650</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> had made<S>6213</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>.
But<S>61</S> the ark<S>727</S> of God<S>430</S> had David<S>1732</S> brought up<S>5927</S> from Kirjathjearim<S>7157</S> to the place which David<S>1732</S> had prepared<S>3559</S> for it: for he had pitched<S>5186</S> a tent<S>168</S> for it at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Moreover the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S>, that Bezaleel<S>1212</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Uri<S>221</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Hur<S>2354</S>, had made<S>6213</S>, he put<S>7760</S> before<S>6440</S> the tabernacle<S>4908</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and Solomon<S>8010</S> and the congregation<S>6951</S> sought<S>1875</S> unto it. <sup>he put: or, was there</sup>
And Solomon<S>8010</S> went up<S>5927</S> thither to the brasen<S>5178</S> altar<S>4196</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, which was at the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>, and offered<S>5927</S> a thousand<S>505</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> upon it.
In that night<S>3915</S> did God<S>430</S> appear<S>7200</S> unto Solomon<S>8010</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, Ask<S>7592</S> what I shall give<S>5414</S> thee.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> said<S>559</S> unto God<S>430</S>, Thou hast shewed<S>6213</S> great<S>1419</S> mercy<S>2617</S> unto David<S>1732</S> my father<S>1</S>, and hast made me to reign<S>4427</S> in his stead.
Now, O LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S>, let thy promise<S>1697</S> unto David<S>1732</S> my father<S>1</S> be established<S>539</S>: for thou hast made me king<S>4427</S> over a people<S>5971</S> like the dust<S>6083</S> of the earth<S>776</S> in multitude<S>7227</S>. <sup>like: Heb. much as the dust of the earth</sup>
Give<S>5414</S> me now wisdom<S>2451</S> and knowledge<S>4093</S>, that I may go out<S>3318</S> and come in<S>935</S> before<S>6440</S> this people<S>5971</S>: for who can judge<S>8199</S> this thy people<S>5971</S>, that is so great<S>1419</S>?
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> to Solomon<S>8010</S>, Because this was in thine heart<S>3824</S>, and thou hast not asked<S>7592</S> riches<S>6239</S>, wealth<S>5233</S>, or honour<S>3519</S>, nor the life<S>5315</S> of thine enemies<S>8130</S>, neither yet hast asked<S>7592</S> long<S>7227</S> life<S>3117</S>; but hast asked<S>7592</S> wisdom<S>2451</S> and knowledge<S>4093</S> for thyself, that thou mayest judge<S>8199</S> my people<S>5971</S>, over whom I have made thee king<S>4427</S>:
Wisdom<S>2451</S> and knowledge<S>4093</S> is granted<S>5414</S> unto thee; and I will give<S>5414</S> thee riches<S>6239</S>, and wealth<S>5233</S>, and honour<S>3519</S>, such as none of the kings<S>4428</S> have had that have been before<S>6440</S> thee, neither shall there any after<S>310</S> thee have the like.
Then Solomon<S>8010</S> came<S>935</S> from his journey to the high place<S>1116</S> that was at Gibeon<S>1391</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, from before<S>6440</S> the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>, and reigned<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> gathered<S>622</S> chariots<S>7393</S> and horsemen<S>6571</S>: and he had a thousand<S>505</S> and four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> chariots<S>7393</S>, and twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> thousand<S>505</S> horsemen<S>6571</S>, which he placed<S>3240</S> in the chariot<S>7393</S> cities<S>5892</S>, and with the king<S>4428</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> made<S>5414</S> silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S> at Jerusalem<S>3389</S> as plenteous as stones<S>68</S>, and cedar trees<S>730</S> made<S>5414</S> he as the sycomore trees<S>8256</S> that are in the vale<S>8219</S> for abundance<S>7230</S>. <sup>made: Heb. gave</sup>
And Solomon<S>8010</S> had horses<S>5483</S> brought<S>4161</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and linen yarn<S>4723</S>: the king's<S>4428</S> merchants<S>5503</S> received<S>3947</S> the linen yarn<S>4723</S> at a price<S>4242</S>. <sup>Solomon: Heb. the going forth of the horses which was Solomon's</sup>
And they fetched up<S>5927</S>, and brought forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S> a chariot<S>4818</S> for six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S>, and an horse<S>5483</S> for an hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S>: and so brought they out<S>3318</S> horses for all the kings<S>4428</S> of the Hittites<S>2850</S>, and for the kings<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, by their means<S>3027</S>. <sup>means: Heb. hand</sup>

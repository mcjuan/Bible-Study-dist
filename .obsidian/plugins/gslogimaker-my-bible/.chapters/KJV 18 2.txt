Again there was a day<S>3117</S> when the sons<S>1121</S> of God<S>430</S> came<S>935</S> to present<S>3320</S> themselves before the LORD<S>3068</S>, and Satan<S>7854</S> came<S>935</S> also among<S>8432</S> them to present<S>3320</S> himself before the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Satan<S>7854</S>, From whence<S>335</S> comest<S>935</S> thou? And Satan<S>7854</S> answered<S>6030</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, From going to and fro<S>7751</S> in the earth<S>776</S>, and from walking up and down<S>1980</S> in it.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Satan<S>7854</S>, Hast thou<S>7760</S> considered<S>3820</S> my servant<S>5650</S> Job<S>347</S>, that there is none like him in the earth<S>776</S>, a perfect<S>8535</S> and an upright<S>3477</S> man<S>376</S>, one that feareth<S>3373</S> God<S>430</S>, and escheweth<S>5493</S> evil<S>7451</S>? and still he holdeth fast<S>2388</S> his integrity<S>8538</S>, although thou movedst<S>5496</S> me against him, to destroy<S>1104</S> him without cause<S>2600</S>. <sup>to destroy: Heb. to swallow him up</sup>
And Satan<S>7854</S> answered<S>6030</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Skin<S>5785</S> for skin<S>5785</S>, yea, all that a man<S>376</S> hath will he give<S>5414</S> for his life<S>5315</S>.
But<S>199</S> put forth<S>7971</S> thine hand<S>3027</S> now, and touch<S>5060</S> his bone<S>6106</S> and his flesh<S>1320</S>, and he will curse<S>1288</S> thee to thy face<S>6440</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Satan<S>7854</S>, Behold, he is in thine hand<S>3027</S>; but save<S>8104</S> his life<S>5315</S>. <sup>but: or, only</sup>
So went<S>3318</S> Satan<S>7854</S> forth<S>3318</S> from the presence<S>6440</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> Job<S>347</S> with sore<S>7451</S> boils<S>7822</S> from the sole<S>3709</S> of his foot<S>7272</S> unto his crown<S>6936</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> him a potsherd<S>2789</S> to scrape<S>1623</S> himself withal; and he sat down<S>3427</S> among<S>8432</S> the ashes<S>665</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> his wife<S>802</S> unto him, Dost thou still retain<S>2388</S> thine integrity<S>8538</S>? curse<S>1288</S> God<S>430</S>, and die<S>4191</S>.
But he said<S>559</S> unto her, Thou speakest<S>1696</S> as one<S>259</S> of the foolish women<S>5036</S> speaketh<S>1696</S>. What<S>1571</S>? shall we receive<S>6901</S> good<S>2896</S> at the hand of God<S>430</S>, and shall we not receive<S>6901</S> evil<S>7451</S>? In all this did not Job<S>347</S> sin<S>2398</S> with his lips<S>8193</S>.
Now when Job's<S>347</S> three<S>7969</S> friends<S>7453</S> heard<S>8085</S> of all this evil<S>7451</S> that was come<S>935</S> upon him, they came<S>935</S> every one<S>376</S> from his own place<S>4725</S>; Eliphaz<S>464</S> the Temanite<S>8489</S>, and Bildad<S>1085</S> the Shuhite<S>7747</S>, and Zophar<S>6691</S> the Naamathite<S>5284</S>: for they had made an appointment<S>3259</S> together<S>3162</S> to come<S>935</S> to mourn<S>5110</S> with him and to comfort<S>5162</S> him.
And when they lifted up<S>5375</S> their eyes<S>5869</S> afar off<S>7350</S>, and knew<S>5234</S> him not, they lifted up<S>5375</S> their voice<S>6963</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>; and they rent<S>7167</S> every one<S>376</S> his mantle<S>4598</S>, and sprinkled<S>2236</S> dust<S>6083</S> upon their heads<S>7218</S> toward heaven<S>8064</S>.
So they sat down<S>3427</S> with him upon the ground<S>776</S> seven<S>7651</S> days<S>3117</S> and seven<S>7651</S> nights<S>3915</S>, and none spake<S>1696</S> a word<S>1697</S> unto him: for they saw<S>7200</S> that his grief<S>3511</S> was very<S>3966</S> great<S>1431</S>.

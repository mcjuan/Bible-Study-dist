Then Joseph<S>3130</S> could<S>3201</S> not refrain<S>662</S> himself before all them that stood<S>5324</S> by him; and he cried<S>7121</S>, Cause<S>3318</S> every man<S>376</S> to go out<S>3318</S> from me. And there stood<S>5975</S> no man<S>376</S> with him, while Joseph<S>3130</S> made himself known<S>3045</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>.
And he wept<S>6963</S> <S>1065</S> aloud<S>5414</S>: and the Egyptians<S>4714</S> and the house<S>1004</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> heard<S>8085</S> <S>8085</S>. <sup>wept: Heb. gave forth his voice in weeping</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, I am Joseph<S>3130</S>; doth my father<S>1</S> yet live<S>2416</S>? And his brethren<S>251</S> could<S>3201</S> not answer<S>6030</S> him; for they were troubled<S>926</S> at his presence<S>6440</S>. <sup>troubled: or, terrified</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, Come near<S>5066</S> to me, I pray you. And they came near<S>5066</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, I am Joseph<S>3130</S> your brother<S>251</S>, whom ye sold<S>4376</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Now therefore be not grieved<S>6087</S>, nor angry<S>2734</S> with yourselves<S>5869</S>, that ye sold<S>4376</S> me hither: for God<S>430</S> did send<S>7971</S> me before you<S>6440</S> to preserve life<S>4241</S>. <sup>nor: Heb. neither let there be anger in your eyes</sup>
For these two years<S>8141</S> hath the famine<S>7458</S> been in<S>7130</S> the land<S>776</S>: and yet there are five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S>, in the which there shall neither<S>369</S> be earing<S>2758</S> nor harvest<S>7105</S>.
And God<S>430</S> sent<S>7971</S> me before you<S>6440</S> to preserve<S>7760</S> you a posterity<S>7611</S> in the earth<S>776</S>, and to save your lives<S>2421</S> by a great<S>1419</S> deliverance<S>6413</S>. <sup>to preserve: Heb. to put for you a remnant</sup>
So now it was not you that sent<S>7971</S> me hither, but God<S>430</S>: and he hath made<S>7760</S> me a father<S>1</S> to Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and lord<S>113</S> of all his house<S>1004</S>, and a ruler<S>4910</S> throughout all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>.
Haste<S>4116</S> ye, and go up<S>5927</S> to my father<S>1</S>, and say<S>559</S> unto him, Thus saith<S>559</S> thy son<S>1121</S> Joseph<S>3130</S>, God<S>430</S> hath made<S>7760</S> me lord<S>113</S> of all Egypt<S>4714</S>: come down<S>3381</S> unto me, tarry<S>5975</S> not:
And thou shalt dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>, and thou shalt be near<S>7138</S> unto me, thou, and thy children<S>1121</S>, and thy children's<S>1121</S> children<S>1121</S>, and thy flocks<S>6629</S>, and thy herds<S>1241</S>, and all that thou hast:
And there will I nourish<S>3557</S> thee; for yet there are five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> of famine<S>7458</S>; lest thou, and thy household<S>1004</S>, and all that thou hast, come to poverty<S>3423</S>.
And, behold, your eyes<S>5869</S> see<S>7200</S>, and the eyes<S>5869</S> of my brother<S>251</S> Benjamin<S>1144</S>, that it is my mouth<S>6310</S> that speaketh<S>1696</S> unto you.
And ye shall tell<S>5046</S> my father<S>1</S> of all my glory<S>3519</S> in Egypt<S>4714</S>, and of all that ye have seen<S>7200</S>; and ye shall haste<S>4116</S> and bring down<S>3381</S> my father<S>1</S> hither.
And he fell<S>5307</S> upon his brother<S>251</S> Benjamin's<S>1144</S> neck<S>6677</S>, and wept<S>1058</S>; and Benjamin<S>1144</S> wept<S>1058</S> upon his neck<S>6677</S>.
Moreover he kissed<S>5401</S> all his brethren<S>251</S>, and wept<S>1058</S> upon them: and after<S>310</S> that his brethren<S>251</S> talked<S>1696</S> with him.
And the fame<S>6963</S> thereof was heard<S>8085</S> in Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> house<S>1004</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Joseph's<S>3130</S> brethren<S>251</S> are come<S>935</S>: and it pleased<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S> well<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S>, and<S>5869</S> his servants<S>5650</S>. <sup>pleased: Heb. was good in the eyes of Pharaoh</sup>
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, Say<S>559</S> unto thy brethren<S>251</S>, This do<S>6213</S> ye; lade<S>2943</S> your beasts<S>1165</S>, and go<S>3212</S>, get<S>935</S> you unto the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>;
And take<S>3947</S> your father<S>1</S> and your households<S>1004</S>, and come<S>935</S> unto me: and I will give<S>5414</S> you the good<S>2898</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and ye shall eat<S>398</S> the fat<S>2459</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
Now thou art commanded<S>6680</S>, this do<S>6213</S> ye; take<S>3947</S> you wagons<S>5699</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> for your little ones<S>2945</S>, and for your wives<S>802</S>, and bring<S>5375</S> your father<S>1</S>, and come<S>935</S>.
Also<S>5869</S> regard<S>2347</S> not your stuff<S>3627</S>; for the good<S>2898</S> of all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> is yours. <sup>regard: Heb. let not your eye spare, etc.</sup>
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did<S>6213</S> so: and Joseph<S>3130</S> gave<S>5414</S> them wagons<S>5699</S>, according to the commandment<S>6310</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> them provision<S>6720</S> for the way<S>1870</S>. <sup>commandment: Heb. mouth</sup>
To all of them he gave<S>5414</S> each man<S>376</S> changes<S>2487</S> of raiment<S>8071</S>; but to Benjamin<S>1144</S> he gave<S>5414</S> three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> pieces of silver<S>3701</S>, and five<S>2568</S> changes<S>2487</S> of raiment<S>8071</S>.
And to his father<S>1</S> he sent<S>7971</S> after this<S>2063</S> manner; ten<S>6235</S> asses<S>860</S> laden<S>5375</S> with the good things<S>2898</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> she asses<S>2543</S> laden<S>5375</S> with corn<S>1250</S> and bread<S>3899</S> and meat<S>4202</S> for his father<S>1</S> by the way<S>1870</S>. <sup>laden: Heb. carrying</sup>
So he sent<S>7971</S> his brethren<S>251</S> away<S>7971</S>, and they departed<S>3212</S>: and he said<S>559</S> unto them, See that ye fall not out<S>7264</S> by the way<S>1870</S>.
And they went up<S>5927</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and came<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S> their father<S>1</S>,
And told<S>5046</S> him, saying<S>559</S>, Joseph<S>3130</S> is yet alive<S>2416</S>, and he is governor<S>4910</S> over all the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>. And Jacob's heart<S>3820</S> fainted<S>6313</S>, for he believed<S>539</S> them not. <sup>Jacob's: Heb. his</sup>
And they told<S>1696</S> him all the words<S>1697</S> of Joseph<S>3130</S>, which he had said<S>1696</S> unto them: and when he saw<S>7200</S> the wagons<S>5699</S> which Joseph<S>3130</S> had sent<S>7971</S> to carry<S>5375</S> him, the spirit<S>7307</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> their father<S>1</S> revived<S>2421</S>:
And Israel<S>3478</S> said<S>559</S>, It is enough<S>7227</S>; Joseph<S>3130</S> my son<S>1121</S> is yet alive<S>2416</S>: I will go<S>3212</S> and see him<S>7200</S> before I die<S>4191</S>.

For, behold, the Lord<S>113</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, doth take away<S>5493</S> from Jerusalem<S>3389</S> and from Judah<S>3063</S> the stay<S>4937</S> and the staff<S>4938</S>, the whole stay<S>4937</S> of bread<S>3899</S>, and the whole<S>3605</S> stay<S>4937</S> of water<S>4325</S>,
The mighty man<S>1368</S>, and the man<S>376</S> of war<S>4421</S>, the judge<S>8199</S>, and the prophet<S>5030</S>, and the prudent<S>7080</S>, and the ancient<S>2205</S>,
The captain<S>8269</S> of fifty<S>2572</S>, and the honourable<S>5375</S> man<S>6440</S>, and the counsellor<S>3289</S>, and the cunning<S>2450</S> artificer<S>2791</S>, and the eloquent<S>995</S> orator<S>3908</S>. <sup>the honourable: Heb. a man eminent in countenance</sup> <sup>eloquent: or, skilful of speech</sup>
And I will give<S>5414</S> children<S>5288</S> to be their princes<S>8269</S>, and babes<S>8586</S> shall rule<S>4910</S> over them.
And the people<S>5971</S> shall be oppressed<S>5065</S>, every one<S>376</S> by another<S>376</S>, and every one<S>376</S> by his neighbour<S>7453</S>: the child<S>5288</S> shall behave himself proudly<S>7292</S> against the ancient<S>2205</S>, and the base<S>7034</S> against the honourable<S>3513</S>.
When a man<S>376</S> shall take hold<S>8610</S> of his brother<S>251</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of his father<S>1</S>, saying, Thou hast clothing<S>8071</S>, be thou our ruler<S>7101</S>, and let this ruin<S>4384</S> be under thy hand<S>3027</S>:
In that day<S>3117</S> shall he swear<S>5375</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I will not be an healer<S>2280</S>; for in my house<S>1004</S> is neither bread<S>3899</S> nor clothing<S>8071</S>: make<S>7760</S> me not a ruler<S>7101</S> of the people<S>5971</S>. <sup>swear: Heb. lift up the hand</sup> <sup>healer: Heb. binder up</sup>
For Jerusalem<S>3389</S> is ruined<S>3782</S>, and Judah<S>3063</S> is fallen<S>5307</S>: because their tongue<S>3956</S> and their doings<S>4611</S> are against the LORD<S>3068</S>, to provoke<S>4784</S> the eyes<S>5869</S> of his glory<S>3519</S>.
The shew<S>1971</S> of their countenance<S>6440</S> doth witness against them<S>6030</S>; and they declare<S>5046</S> their sin<S>2403</S> as Sodom<S>5467</S>, they hide<S>3582</S> it not. Woe<S>188</S> unto their soul<S>5315</S>! for they have rewarded<S>1580</S> evil<S>7451</S> unto themselves.
Say<S>559</S> ye to the righteous<S>6662</S>, that it shall be well<S>2896</S> with him: for they shall eat<S>398</S> the fruit<S>6529</S> of their doings<S>4611</S>.
Woe<S>188</S> unto the wicked<S>7563</S>! it shall be ill<S>7451</S> with him: for the reward<S>1576</S> of his hands<S>3027</S> shall be given<S>6213</S> him. <sup>given: Heb. done to him</sup>
As for my people<S>5971</S>, children<S>5953</S> are their oppressors<S>5065</S>, and women<S>802</S> rule<S>4910</S> over them. O my people<S>5971</S>, they which lead<S>833</S> thee cause thee to err<S>8582</S>, and destroy<S>1104</S> the way<S>1870</S> of thy paths<S>734</S>. <sup>lead: or, call thee blessed</sup> <sup>destroy: Heb. swallow up</sup>
The LORD<S>3068</S> standeth up<S>5324</S> to plead<S>7378</S>, and standeth<S>5975</S> to judge<S>1777</S> the people<S>5971</S>.
The LORD<S>3068</S> will enter<S>935</S> into judgment<S>4941</S> with the ancients<S>2205</S> of his people<S>5971</S>, and the princes<S>8269</S> thereof: for ye have eaten up<S>1197</S> the vineyard<S>3754</S>; the spoil<S>1500</S> of the poor<S>6041</S> is in your houses<S>1004</S>. <sup>eaten: or, burnt</sup>
What mean ye that ye beat<S>1792</S> my people<S>5971</S> to pieces<S>1792</S>, and grind<S>2912</S> the faces<S>6440</S> of the poor<S>6041</S>? saith<S>5002</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>.
Moreover the LORD<S>3068</S> saith<S>559</S>, Because<S>3282</S> the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S> are haughty<S>1361</S>, and walk<S>3212</S> with stretched forth<S>5186</S> necks<S>1627</S> and wanton<S>8265</S> eyes<S>5869</S>, walking<S>1980</S> and mincing<S>2952</S> as they go<S>3212</S>, and making a tinkling<S>5913</S> with their feet<S>7272</S>: <sup>wanton: Heb. deceiving with their eyes</sup> <sup>mincing: or, tripping nicely</sup>
Therefore the Lord<S>136</S> will smite with a scab<S>5596</S> the crown of the head<S>6936</S> of the daughters<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> will discover<S>6168</S> their secret parts<S>6596</S>. <sup>discover: Heb. make naked</sup>
In that day<S>3117</S> the Lord<S>136</S> will take away<S>5493</S> the bravery<S>8597</S> of their tinkling ornaments<S>5914</S> about their feet, and their cauls<S>7636</S>, and their round tires like the moon<S>7720</S>, <sup>cauls: or, networks</sup>
The chains<S>5188</S>, and the bracelets<S>8285</S>, and the mufflers<S>7479</S>, <sup>chains: or, sweet balls</sup> <sup>mufflers: or, spangled ornaments</sup>
The bonnets<S>6287</S>, and the ornaments of the legs<S>6807</S>, and the headbands<S>7196</S>, and the tablets<S>5315</S> <S>1004</S>, and the earrings<S>3908</S>, <sup>tablets: Heb. houses of the soul</sup>
The rings<S>2885</S>, and nose<S>639</S> jewels<S>5141</S>,
The changeable suits of apparel<S>4254</S>, and the mantles<S>4595</S>, and the wimples<S>4304</S>, and the crisping pins<S>2754</S>,
The glasses<S>1549</S>, and the fine linen<S>5466</S>, and the hoods<S>6797</S>, and the vails<S>7289</S>.
And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell<S>1314</S> there shall be stink<S>4716</S>; and instead of a girdle<S>2290</S> a rent<S>5364</S>; and instead of well set<S>4639</S> hair<S>4748</S> baldness<S>7144</S>; and instead of a stomacher<S>6614</S> a girding<S>4228</S> of sackcloth<S>8242</S>; and burning<S>3587</S> instead of beauty<S>3308</S>.
Thy men<S>4962</S> shall fall<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>, and thy mighty<S>1369</S> in the war<S>4421</S>. <sup>mighty: Heb. might</sup>
And her gates<S>6607</S> shall lament<S>578</S> and mourn<S>56</S>; and she being desolate<S>5352</S> shall sit<S>3427</S> upon the ground<S>776</S>. <sup>desolate: or, emptied: Heb. cleansed</sup>

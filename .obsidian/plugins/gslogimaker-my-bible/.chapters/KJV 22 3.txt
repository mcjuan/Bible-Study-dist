By night<S>3915</S> on my bed<S>4904</S> I sought<S>1245</S> him whom my soul<S>5315</S> loveth<S>157</S>: I sought<S>1245</S> him, but I found<S>4672</S> him not.
I will rise<S>6965</S> now, and go about<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> in the streets<S>7784</S>, and in the broad ways<S>7339</S> I will seek<S>1245</S> him whom my soul<S>5315</S> loveth<S>157</S>: I sought<S>1245</S> him, but I found<S>4672</S> him not.
The watchmen<S>8104</S> that go about<S>5437</S> the city<S>5892</S> found<S>4672</S> me: to whom I said, Saw<S>7200</S> ye him whom my soul<S>5315</S> loveth<S>157</S>?
It was but a little<S>4592</S> that I passed<S>5674</S> from them, but I found<S>4672</S> him whom my soul<S>5315</S> loveth<S>157</S>: I held<S>270</S> him, and would not let him go<S>7503</S>, until I had brought<S>935</S> him into my mother's<S>517</S> house<S>1004</S>, and into the chamber<S>2315</S> of her that conceived<S>2029</S> me.
I charge<S>7650</S> you, O ye daughters<S>1323</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, by the roes<S>6643</S>, and<S>176</S> by the hinds<S>355</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, that ye stir not up<S>5782</S>, nor awake<S>5782</S> my love<S>160</S>, till he please<S>2654</S>.
Who is this that cometh<S>5927</S> out of the wilderness<S>4057</S> like pillars<S>8490</S> of smoke<S>6227</S>, perfumed<S>6999</S> with myrrh<S>4753</S> and frankincense<S>3828</S>, with all powders<S>81</S> of the merchant<S>7402</S>?
Behold his bed<S>4296</S>, which is Solomon's<S>8010</S>; threescore<S>8346</S> valiant<S>1368</S> men are about<S>5439</S> it, of the valiant<S>1368</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
They all hold<S>270</S> swords<S>2719</S>, being expert<S>3925</S> in war<S>4421</S>: every man<S>376</S> hath his sword<S>2719</S> upon his thigh<S>3409</S> because of fear<S>6343</S> in the night<S>3915</S>.
King<S>4428</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> made<S>6213</S> himself a chariot<S>668</S> of the wood<S>6086</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S>. <sup>a chariot: or, a bed</sup>
He made<S>6213</S> the pillars<S>5982</S> thereof of silver<S>3701</S>, the bottom<S>7507</S> thereof of gold<S>2091</S>, the covering<S>4817</S> of it of purple<S>713</S>, the midst<S>8432</S> thereof being paved<S>7528</S> with love<S>160</S>, for the daughters<S>1323</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
Go forth<S>3318</S>, O ye daughters<S>1323</S> of Zion<S>6726</S>, and behold<S>7200</S> king<S>4428</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> with the crown<S>5850</S> wherewith his mother<S>517</S> crowned<S>5849</S> him in the day<S>3117</S> of his espousals<S>2861</S>, and in the day<S>3117</S> of the gladness<S>8057</S> of his heart<S>3820</S>.

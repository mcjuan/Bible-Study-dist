All the days<S>3117</S> of his separation<S>5145</S> shall he eat<S>398</S> nothing that is made<S>6213</S> of the vine<S>3196</S> tree<S>1612</S>, from the kernels<S>2785</S> even to the husk<S>2085</S>. <sup>separation: or, Nazariteship</sup> <sup>vine: Heb. vine of the wine</sup>

All the days<S>3117</S> that he separateth<S>5144</S> himself unto the LORD<S>3068</S> he shall come<S>935</S> at no dead<S>4191</S> body<S>5315</S>.
He shall not make himself unclean<S>2930</S> for his father<S>1</S>, or for his mother<S>517</S>, for his brother<S>251</S>, or for his sister<S>269</S>, when they die<S>4194</S>: because the consecration<S>5145</S> of his God<S>430</S> is upon his head<S>7218</S>. <sup>consecration: Heb. separation</sup>
All the days<S>3117</S> of his separation<S>5145</S> he is holy<S>6918</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And if any man<S>4191</S> die<S>4191</S> very<S>6621</S> suddenly<S>6597</S> by him, and he hath defiled<S>2930</S> the head<S>7218</S> of his consecration<S>5145</S>; then he shall shave<S>1548</S> his head<S>7218</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of his cleansing<S>2893</S>, on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> shall he shave<S>1548</S> it.
And on the eighth<S>8066</S> day<S>3117</S> he shall bring<S>935</S> two<S>8147</S> turtles<S>8449</S>, or two<S>8147</S> young<S>1121</S> pigeons<S>3123</S>, to the priest<S>3548</S>, to the door<S>6607</S> of the tabernacle<S>168</S> of the congregation<S>4150</S>:

And he shall consecrate<S>5144</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> the days<S>3117</S> of his separation<S>5145</S>, and shall bring<S>935</S> a lamb<S>3532</S> of the first<S>1121</S> year<S>8141</S> for a trespass offering<S>817</S>: but the days<S>3117</S> that were before<S>7223</S> shall be lost<S>5307</S>, because his separation<S>5145</S> was defiled<S>2930</S>. <sup>be lost: Heb. fall</sup>

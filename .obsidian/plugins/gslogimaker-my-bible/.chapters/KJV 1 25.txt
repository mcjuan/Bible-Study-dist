Then again<S>3254</S> Abraham<S>85</S> took<S>3947</S> a wife<S>802</S>, and her name<S>8034</S> was Keturah<S>6989</S>.
And she bare<S>3205</S> him Zimran<S>2175</S>, and Jokshan<S>3370</S>, and Medan<S>4091</S>, and Midian<S>4080</S>, and Ishbak<S>3435</S>, and Shuah<S>7744</S>.
And Jokshan<S>3370</S> begat<S>3205</S> Sheba<S>7614</S>, and Dedan<S>1719</S>. And the sons<S>1121</S> of Dedan<S>1719</S> were Asshurim<S>805</S>, and Letushim<S>3912</S>, and Leummim<S>3817</S>.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Midian<S>4080</S>; Ephah<S>5891</S>, and Epher<S>6081</S>, and Hanoch<S>2585</S>, and Abida<S>28</S>, and Eldaah<S>420</S>. All these were the children<S>1121</S> of Keturah<S>6989</S>.
And Abraham<S>85</S> gave<S>5414</S> all that he had unto Isaac<S>3327</S>.
But unto the sons<S>1121</S> of the concubines<S>6370</S>, which Abraham<S>85</S> had, Abraham<S>85</S> gave<S>5414</S> gifts<S>4979</S>, and sent them away<S>7971</S> from Isaac<S>3327</S> his son<S>1121</S>, while he yet lived<S>2416</S>, eastward<S>6924</S>, unto the east<S>6924</S> country<S>776</S>.
And these are the days<S>3117</S> of the years<S>8141</S> of Abraham's<S>85</S> life<S>2416</S> which he lived<S>2425</S>, an hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> threescore and fifteen<S>7657</S> <S>8141</S> <S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S>.
Then Abraham<S>85</S> gave up the ghost<S>1478</S>, and died<S>4191</S> in a good<S>2896</S> old age<S>7872</S>, an old man<S>2205</S>, and full<S>7649</S> of years; and was gathered<S>622</S> to his people<S>5971</S>.
And his sons<S>1121</S> Isaac<S>3327</S> and Ishmael<S>3458</S> buried<S>6912</S> him in the cave<S>4631</S> of Machpelah<S>4375</S>, in the field<S>7704</S> of Ephron<S>6085</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zohar<S>6714</S> the Hittite<S>2850</S>, which is before<S>6440</S> Mamre<S>4471</S>;
The field<S>7704</S> which Abraham<S>85</S> purchased<S>7069</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Heth<S>2845</S>: there was Abraham<S>85</S> buried<S>6912</S>, and Sarah<S>8283</S> his wife<S>802</S>.
And it came to pass after<S>310</S> the death<S>4194</S> of Abraham<S>85</S>, that God<S>430</S> blessed<S>1288</S> his son<S>1121</S> Isaac<S>3327</S>; and Isaac<S>3327</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> by<S>5973</S> the well Lahairoi<S>883</S>.
Now these are the generations<S>8435</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>, Abraham's<S>85</S> son<S>1121</S>, whom Hagar<S>1904</S> the Egyptian<S>4713</S>, Sarah's<S>8283</S> handmaid<S>8198</S>, bare<S>3205</S> unto Abraham<S>85</S>:
And these are the names<S>8034</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>, by their names<S>8034</S>, according to their generations<S>8435</S>: the firstborn<S>1060</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>, Nebajoth<S>5032</S>; and Kedar<S>6938</S>, and Adbeel<S>110</S>, and Mibsam<S>4017</S>,
And Mishma<S>4927</S>, and Dumah<S>1746</S>, and Massa<S>4854</S>,
Hadar<S>2316</S>, and Tema<S>8485</S>, Jetur<S>3195</S>, Naphish<S>5305</S>, and Kedemah<S>6929</S>: <sup>Hadar: or, Hadad</sup>
These are the sons<S>1121</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>, and these are their names<S>8034</S>, by their towns<S>2691</S>, and by their castles<S>2918</S>; twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> princes<S>5387</S> according to their nations<S>523</S>.
And these are the years<S>8141</S> of the life<S>2416</S> of Ishmael<S>3458</S>, an hundred<S>3967</S> <S>8141</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> <S>8141</S> and seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>: and he gave up the ghost<S>1478</S> and died<S>4191</S>; and was gathered<S>622</S> unto his people<S>5971</S>.
And they dwelt<S>7931</S> from Havilah<S>2341</S> unto Shur<S>7793</S>, that is before<S>6440</S> Egypt<S>4714</S>, as thou goest<S>935</S> toward Assyria<S>804</S>: and he died<S>5307</S> in the presence<S>6440</S> of all his brethren<S>251</S>. <sup>died: Heb. fell</sup>
And these are the generations<S>8435</S> of Isaac<S>3327</S>, Abraham's<S>85</S> son<S>1121</S>: Abraham<S>85</S> begat<S>3205</S> Isaac<S>3327</S>:
And Isaac<S>3327</S> was forty<S>705</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when he took<S>3947</S> Rebekah<S>7259</S> to wife<S>802</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Bethuel<S>1328</S> the Syrian<S>761</S> of Padanaram<S>6307</S>, the sister<S>269</S> to Laban<S>3837</S> the Syrian<S>761</S>.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> intreated<S>6279</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> for<S>5227</S> his wife<S>802</S>, because she was barren<S>6135</S>: and the LORD<S>3068</S> was intreated<S>6279</S> of him, and Rebekah<S>7259</S> his wife<S>802</S> conceived<S>2029</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> struggled together<S>7533</S> within her<S>7130</S>; and she said<S>559</S>, If it be so, why am I thus<S>2088</S>? And she went<S>3212</S> to enquire<S>1875</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Two<S>8147</S> nations<S>1471</S> are in thy womb<S>990</S>, and two manner<S>8147</S> of people<S>3816</S> shall be separated<S>6504</S> from thy bowels<S>4578</S>; and the one people<S>3816</S> shall be stronger<S>553</S> than the other people<S>3816</S>; and the elder<S>7227</S> shall serve<S>5647</S> the younger<S>6810</S>.
And when her days<S>3117</S> to be delivered<S>3205</S> were fulfilled<S>4390</S>, behold, there were twins<S>8380</S> in her womb<S>990</S>.
And the first<S>7223</S> came out<S>3318</S> red<S>132</S>, all over like an hairy<S>8181</S> garment<S>155</S>; and they called<S>7121</S> his name<S>8034</S> Esau<S>6215</S>.
And after<S>310</S> that came<S>3318</S> his brother<S>251</S> out<S>3318</S>, and his hand<S>3027</S> took hold<S>270</S> on Esau's<S>6215</S> heel<S>6119</S>; and his name<S>8034</S> was called<S>7121</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>: and Isaac<S>3327</S> was threescore<S>8346</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> when she bare<S>3205</S> them.
And the boys<S>5288</S> grew<S>1431</S>: and Esau<S>6215</S> was a cunning<S>3045</S> hunter<S>6718</S>, a man<S>376</S> of the field<S>7704</S>; and Jacob<S>3290</S> was a plain<S>8535</S> man<S>376</S>, dwelling<S>3427</S> in tents<S>168</S>.
And Isaac<S>3327</S> loved<S>157</S> Esau<S>6215</S>, because he did eat<S>6310</S> of his venison<S>6718</S>: but Rebekah<S>7259</S> loved<S>157</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>. <sup>he: Heb. venison was in his mouth</sup>
And Jacob<S>3290</S> sod<S>2102</S> pottage<S>5138</S>: and Esau<S>6215</S> came<S>935</S> from the field<S>7704</S>, and he was faint<S>5889</S>:
And Esau<S>6215</S> said<S>559</S> to Jacob<S>3290</S>, Feed<S>3938</S> me, I pray thee, with<S>4480</S> that same<S>122</S> red<S>122</S> pottage; for I am faint<S>5889</S>: therefore was his name<S>8034</S> called<S>7121</S> Edom<S>123</S>. <sup>with: Heb. with that red, with that red pottage</sup> <sup>Edom: that is Red</sup>
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S>, Sell<S>4376</S> me this day<S>3117</S> thy birthright<S>1062</S>.
And Esau<S>6215</S> said<S>559</S>, Behold, I am at the point<S>1980</S> to die<S>4191</S>: and what profit shall this birthright<S>1062</S> do to me? <sup>at: Heb. going to die</sup>
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S>, Swear<S>7650</S> to me this day<S>3117</S>; and he sware<S>7650</S> unto him: and he sold<S>4376</S> his birthright<S>1062</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>.
Then Jacob<S>3290</S> gave<S>5414</S> Esau<S>6215</S> bread<S>3899</S> and pottage<S>5138</S> of lentiles<S>5742</S>; and he did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>, and rose up<S>6965</S>, and went his way<S>3212</S>: thus Esau<S>6215</S> despised<S>959</S> his birthright<S>1062</S>.

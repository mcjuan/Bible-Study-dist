Thus the heavens<S>8064</S> and the earth<S>776</S> were finished<S>3615</S>, and all the host of them<S>6635</S>.
And on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> God<S>430</S> ended<S>3615</S> his work<S>4399</S> which he had made<S>6213</S>; and he rested<S>7673</S> on the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> from all his work<S>4399</S> which he had made<S>6213</S>.
And God<S>430</S> blessed<S>1288</S> the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S>, and sanctified<S>6942</S> it: because<S>3588</S> that in it he had rested<S>7673</S> from all his work<S>4399</S> which God<S>430</S> created<S>1254</S> and made<S>6213</S>. <sup>created: Heb. created to make</sup>
These<S>428</S> are the generations<S>8435</S> of the heavens<S>8064</S> and of the earth<S>776</S> when they were created<S>1254</S>, in the day<S>3117</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> made<S>6213</S> the earth<S>776</S> and the heavens<S>8064</S>,
And every plant<S>7880</S> of the field<S>7704</S> before<S>2962</S> it was in the earth<S>776</S>, and every herb<S>6212</S> of the field<S>7704</S> before<S>2962</S> it grew<S>6779</S>: for<S>3588</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> had not<S>3808</S> caused it to rain<S>4305</S> upon the earth<S>776</S>, and there was not<S>369</S> a man<S>120</S> to till<S>5647</S> the ground<S>127</S>.
But there went up<S>5927</S> a mist<S>108</S> from<S>4480</S> the earth<S>776</S>, and watered<S>8248</S> the whole face<S>6440</S> of the ground<S>127</S>. <sup>there: or, a mist which went up from, etc.</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> formed<S>3335</S> man<S>120</S> of the dust<S>6083</S> of<S>4480</S> the ground<S>127</S>, and breathed<S>5301</S> into his nostrils<S>639</S> the breath<S>5397</S> of life<S>2416</S>; and man<S>120</S> became a living<S>2416</S> soul<S>5315</S>. <sup>of the dust: Heb. dust of the ground</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> planted<S>5193</S> a garden<S>1588</S> eastward<S>6924</S> in Eden<S>5731</S>; and there<S>8033</S> he put<S>7760</S> the man<S>120</S> whom<S>834</S> he had formed<S>3335</S>.
And out<S>4480</S> of the ground<S>127</S> made<S>6779</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> to grow<S>6779</S> every tree<S>6086</S> that is pleasant<S>2530</S> to the sight<S>4758</S>, and good<S>2896</S> for food<S>3978</S>; the tree<S>6086</S> of life<S>2416</S> also in the midst<S>8432</S> of the garden<S>1588</S>, and the tree<S>6086</S> of knowledge<S>1847</S> of good<S>2896</S> and evil<S>7451</S>.
And a river<S>5104</S> went out<S>3318</S> of Eden<S>5731</S> to water<S>8248</S> the garden<S>1588</S>; and from thence it was parted<S>6504</S>, and became into four<S>702</S> heads<S>7218</S>.
The name<S>8034</S> of the first<S>259</S> is Pison<S>6376</S>: that<S>1931</S> is it which compasseth<S>5437</S> the whole land<S>776</S> of Havilah<S>2341</S>, where<S>834</S> there is gold<S>2091</S>;
And the gold<S>2091</S> of that<S>1931</S> land<S>776</S> is good<S>2896</S>: there is bdellium<S>916</S> and the onyx<S>7718</S> stone<S>68</S>.
And the name<S>8034</S> of the second<S>8145</S> river<S>5104</S> is Gihon<S>1521</S>: the same is it that compasseth<S>5437</S> the whole land<S>776</S> of Ethiopia<S>3568</S>. <sup>Ethiopia: Heb. Cush</sup>
And the name<S>8034</S> of the third<S>7992</S> river<S>5104</S> is Hiddekel<S>2313</S>: that is it which goeth toward<S>1980</S> the east<S>6926</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>. And the fourth<S>7243</S> river<S>5104</S> is Euphrates<S>6578</S>. <sup>toward: or, eastward to Assyria</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> took<S>3947</S> the man<S>120</S>, and put him<S>3240</S> into the garden<S>1588</S> of Eden<S>5731</S> to dress<S>5647</S> it and to keep<S>8104</S> it. <sup>the man: or, Adam</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> commanded<S>6680</S> the man<S>120</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Of every tree<S>6086</S> of the garden<S>1588</S> thou mayest freely<S>398</S> eat<S>398</S>: <sup>thou: Heb. eating thou shalt eat</sup>

And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S>, It is not good<S>2896</S> that the man<S>120</S> should be<S>1961</S> alone; I will make<S>6213</S> him an help meet<S>5828</S> for him. <sup>meet: Heb. as before him</sup>
And out of the ground<S>127</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> formed<S>3335</S> every beast<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, and every fowl<S>5775</S> of the air<S>8064</S>; and brought<S>935</S> them unto Adam<S>120</S> to see<S>7200</S> what he would call<S>7121</S> them: and whatsoever Adam<S>120</S> called<S>7121</S> every living<S>2416</S> creature<S>5315</S>, that<S>1931</S> was the name thereof<S>8034</S>. <sup>Adam: or, the man</sup>

And the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> caused<S>5307</S> a deep sleep<S>8639</S> to fall<S>5307</S> upon Adam<S>121</S>, and he slept<S>3462</S>: and he took<S>3947</S> one<S>259</S> of his ribs<S>6763</S>, and closed up<S>5462</S> the flesh<S>1320</S> instead thereof;
And the rib<S>6763</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> had taken<S>3947</S> from man<S>120</S>, made<S>1129</S> he a woman<S>802</S>, and brought<S>935</S> her unto the man<S>120</S>. <sup>made: Heb. builded</sup>

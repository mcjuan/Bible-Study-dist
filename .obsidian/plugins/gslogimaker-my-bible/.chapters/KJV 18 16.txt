Then Job<S>347</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>,
I have heard<S>8085</S> many such things<S>7227</S>: miserable<S>5999</S> comforters<S>5162</S> are ye all. <sup>miserable: or, troublesome</sup>
Shall vain<S>7307</S> words<S>1697</S> have an end<S>7093</S>? or what emboldeneth<S>4834</S> thee that thou answerest<S>6030</S>? <sup>vain: Heb. words of wind</sup>
I also could speak<S>1696</S> as ye do: if<S>3863</S> your soul<S>5315</S> were<S>3426</S> in my soul's<S>5315</S> stead, I could heap up<S>2266</S> words<S>4405</S> against you, and shake<S>5128</S> mine head<S>7218</S> at<S>1119</S> you.
But I would strengthen<S>553</S> you with<S>1119</S> my mouth<S>6310</S>, and the moving<S>5205</S> of my lips<S>8193</S> should asswage<S>2820</S> your grief.
Though I speak<S>1696</S>, my grief<S>3511</S> is not asswaged<S>2820</S>: and though I forbear<S>2308</S>, what am I eased<S>1980</S>? <sup>what: Heb. what goeth from me?</sup>
But now he hath made me weary<S>3811</S>: thou hast made desolate<S>8074</S> all my company<S>5712</S>.
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles<S>7059</S>, which is a witness<S>5707</S> against me: and my leanness<S>3585</S> rising up<S>6965</S> in me beareth witness<S>6030</S> to my face<S>6440</S>.
He teareth<S>2963</S> me in his wrath<S>639</S>, who hateth<S>7852</S> me: he gnasheth<S>2786</S> upon me with his teeth<S>8127</S>; mine enemy<S>6862</S> sharpeneth<S>3913</S> his eyes<S>5869</S> upon me.
They have gaped<S>6473</S> upon me with their mouth<S>6310</S>; they have smitten<S>5221</S> me upon the cheek<S>3895</S> reproachfully<S>2781</S>; they have gathered<S>4390</S> themselves together<S>3162</S> against me.
God<S>410</S> hath delivered<S>5462</S> me to the ungodly<S>5760</S>, and turned me over<S>3399</S> into the hands<S>3027</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>. <sup>hath: Heb. hath shut me up</sup>
I was at ease<S>7961</S>, but he hath broken me asunder<S>6565</S>: he hath also taken<S>270</S> me by my neck<S>6203</S>, and shaken me to pieces<S>6327</S>, and set me up<S>6965</S> for his mark<S>4307</S>.
His archers<S>7228</S> compass me round about<S>5437</S>, he cleaveth<S>6398</S> my reins<S>3629</S> asunder<S>6398</S>, and doth not spare<S>2550</S>; he poureth out<S>8210</S> my gall<S>4845</S> upon the ground<S>776</S>.
He breaketh<S>6555</S> me with breach<S>6556</S> upon<S>6440</S> breach<S>6556</S>, he runneth<S>7323</S> upon me like a giant<S>1368</S>.
I have sewed<S>8609</S> sackcloth<S>8242</S> upon my skin<S>1539</S>, and defiled<S>5953</S> my horn<S>7161</S> in the dust<S>6083</S>.
My face<S>6440</S> is foul<S>2560</S> with weeping<S>1065</S>, and on my eyelids<S>6079</S> is the shadow of death<S>6757</S>;
Not for any injustice<S>2555</S> in mine hands<S>3709</S>: also my prayer<S>8605</S> is pure<S>2134</S>.
O earth<S>776</S>, cover<S>3680</S> not thou my blood<S>1818</S>, and let my cry<S>2201</S> have no place<S>4725</S>.
Also now, behold, my witness<S>5707</S> is in heaven<S>8064</S>, and my record<S>7717</S> is on high<S>4791</S>. <sup>on high: Heb. in the high places</sup>
My friends<S>7453</S> scorn<S>3887</S> me: but mine eye<S>5869</S> poureth out<S>1811</S> tears unto God<S>433</S>. <sup>scorn me: Heb. are my scorners</sup>
O that one might plead<S>3198</S> for a man<S>1397</S> with God<S>433</S>, as a man<S>120</S> pleadeth for his neighbour<S>1121</S> <S>7453</S>! <sup>neighbour: or, friend</sup>
When a few<S>4557</S> years<S>8141</S> are come<S>857</S>, then I shall go<S>1980</S> the way<S>734</S> whence I shall not return<S>7725</S>. <sup>a few: Heb. years of number</sup>

Then Joseph<S>3130</S> came<S>935</S> and told<S>5046</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and said<S>559</S>, My father<S>1</S> and my brethren<S>251</S>, and their flocks<S>6629</S>, and their herds<S>1241</S>, and all that they have, are come out<S>935</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>; and, behold, they are in the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> some<S>7097</S> of his brethren<S>251</S>, even five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S>, and presented<S>3322</S> them unto<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto his brethren<S>251</S>, What is your occupation<S>4639</S>? And they said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, Thy servants<S>5650</S> are shepherds<S>7462</S> <S>6629</S>, both we, and also our fathers<S>1</S>.
They said<S>559</S> moreover unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, For to sojourn<S>1481</S> in the land<S>776</S> are we come<S>935</S>; for thy servants<S>5650</S> have no pasture<S>4829</S> for their flocks<S>6629</S>; for the famine<S>7458</S> is sore<S>3515</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants<S>5650</S> dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thy father<S>1</S> and thy brethren<S>251</S> are come<S>935</S> unto thee:
The land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> is before thee<S>6440</S>; in the best<S>4315</S> of the land<S>776</S> make<S>3427</S> thy father<S>1</S> and brethren<S>251</S> to dwell<S>3427</S>; in the land<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S> let them dwell<S>3427</S>: and if thou knowest<S>3045</S> <S>3426</S> any men<S>582</S> of activity<S>2428</S> among them, then make them<S>7760</S> rulers<S>8269</S> over my cattle<S>4735</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> brought in<S>935</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> his father<S>1</S>, and set him<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and Jacob<S>3290</S> blessed<S>1288</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> said<S>559</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>, How<S>4100</S> old<S>2416</S> <S>3117</S> <S>8141</S> art thou? <sup>How: Heb. How many are the days of the years of thy life?</sup>
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, The days<S>3117</S> of the years<S>8141</S> of my pilgrimage<S>4033</S> are an hundred<S>3967</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> years<S>8141</S>: few<S>4592</S> and evil<S>7451</S> have the days<S>3117</S> of the years<S>8141</S> of my life<S>2416</S> been, and have not attained<S>5381</S> unto the days<S>3117</S> of the years<S>8141</S> of the life<S>2416</S> of my fathers<S>1</S> in the days<S>3117</S> of their pilgrimage<S>4033</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> blessed<S>1288</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and went out<S>3318</S> from before<S>6440</S> Pharaoh<S>6547</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> placed<S>3427</S> his father<S>1</S> and his brethren<S>251</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> them a possession<S>272</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, in the best<S>4315</S> of the land<S>776</S>, in the land<S>776</S> of Rameses<S>7486</S>, as Pharaoh<S>6547</S> had commanded<S>6680</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> nourished<S>3557</S> his father<S>1</S>, and his brethren<S>251</S>, and all his father's<S>1</S> household<S>1004</S>, with bread<S>3899</S>, according<S>6310</S> to their families<S>2945</S>. <sup>according: or, as a little child is nourished: Heb. according to the little ones</sup>
And there was no bread<S>3899</S> in all the land<S>776</S>; for the famine<S>7458</S> was very<S>3966</S> sore<S>3515</S>, so that the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> and all the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S> fainted<S>3856</S> by reason<S>6440</S> of the famine<S>7458</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> gathered up<S>3950</S> all the money<S>3701</S> that was found<S>4672</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, for the corn<S>7668</S> which they bought<S>7666</S>: and Joseph<S>3130</S> brought<S>935</S> the money<S>3701</S> into Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> house<S>1004</S>.
And when money<S>3701</S> failed<S>8552</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and in the land<S>776</S> of Canaan<S>3667</S>, all the Egyptians<S>4714</S> came<S>935</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Give<S>3051</S> us bread<S>3899</S>: for why should we die<S>4191</S> in thy presence? for the money<S>3701</S> faileth<S>656</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S>, Give<S>3051</S> your cattle<S>4735</S>; and I will give<S>5414</S> you for your cattle<S>4735</S>, if money<S>3701</S> fail<S>656</S>.
And they brought<S>935</S> their cattle<S>4735</S> unto Joseph<S>3130</S>: and Joseph<S>3130</S> gave<S>5414</S> them bread<S>3899</S> in exchange for horses<S>5483</S>, and for the flocks<S>6629</S>, and for the cattle<S>4735</S> of the herds<S>1241</S>, and for the asses<S>2543</S>: and he fed<S>5095</S> them with bread<S>3899</S> for all their cattle<S>4735</S> for that year<S>8141</S>. <sup>fed: Heb. led them</sup>
When that year<S>8141</S> was ended<S>8552</S>, they came<S>935</S> unto him the second<S>8145</S> year<S>8141</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, We will not hide<S>3582</S> it from my lord<S>113</S>, how that our money<S>3701</S> is spent<S>8552</S>; my lord<S>113</S> also hath<S>413</S> our herds<S>4735</S> of cattle<S>929</S>; there is not ought left<S>7604</S> in the sight<S>6440</S> of my lord<S>113</S>, but our bodies<S>1472</S>, and our lands<S>127</S>:
Wherefore shall we die<S>4191</S> before thine eyes<S>5869</S>, both we and our land<S>127</S>? buy<S>7069</S> us and our land<S>127</S> for bread<S>3899</S>, and we and our land<S>127</S> will be servants<S>5650</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: and give<S>5414</S> us seed<S>2233</S>, that we may live<S>2421</S>, and not die<S>4191</S>, that the land<S>127</S> be not desolate<S>3456</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> bought<S>7069</S> all the land<S>127</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> for Pharaoh<S>6547</S>; for the Egyptians<S>4714</S> sold<S>4376</S> every man<S>376</S> his field<S>7704</S>, because the famine<S>7458</S> prevailed<S>2388</S> over them: so the land<S>776</S> became Pharaoh's<S>6547</S>.
And as for the people<S>5971</S>, he removed<S>5674</S> them to cities<S>5892</S> from one end<S>7097</S> of the borders<S>1366</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> even to the other end<S>7097</S> thereof.
Only the land<S>127</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> bought he<S>7069</S> not; for the priests<S>3548</S> had a portion<S>2706</S> assigned them of Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and did eat<S>398</S> their portion<S>2706</S> which Pharaoh<S>6547</S> gave<S>5414</S> them: wherefore they sold<S>4376</S> not their lands<S>127</S>. <sup>priests: or, princes</sup>
Then Joseph<S>3130</S> said<S>559</S> unto the people<S>5971</S>, Behold, I have bought<S>7069</S> <S>853</S> you this day<S>3117</S> and your land<S>127</S> for Pharaoh<S>6547</S>: lo<S>1887</S>, here is seed<S>2233</S> for you, and ye shall sow<S>2232</S> the land<S>127</S>.
And it shall come to pass in the increase<S>8393</S>, that ye shall give<S>5414</S> the fifth<S>2549</S> part unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, and four<S>702</S> parts<S>3027</S> shall be your own, for seed<S>2233</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, and for your food<S>400</S>, and for them of your households<S>1004</S>, and for food<S>398</S> for your little ones<S>2945</S>.
And they said<S>559</S>, Thou hast saved our lives<S>2421</S>: let us find<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of my lord<S>113</S>, and we will be Pharaoh's<S>6547</S> servants<S>5650</S>.
And Joseph<S>3130</S> made<S>7760</S> it a law<S>2706</S> over the land<S>127</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> unto this day<S>3117</S>, that Pharaoh<S>6547</S> should have the fifth<S>2569</S> part; except<S>7535</S> the land<S>127</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> only, which became not Pharaoh's<S>6547</S>. <sup>priests: or, princes</sup>
And Israel<S>3478</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, in the country<S>776</S> of Goshen<S>1657</S>; and they had possessions<S>270</S> therein, and grew<S>6509</S>, and multiplied<S>7235</S> exceedingly<S>3966</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> lived<S>2421</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> seventeen<S>6240</S> <S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>: so the whole age<S>2416</S> <S>3117</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> was an hundred<S>3967</S> forty<S>705</S> <S>8141</S> and seven<S>7651</S> years<S>8141</S>. <sup>the whole: Heb. the days of the years of his life</sup>
And the time<S>3117</S> drew nigh<S>7126</S> that Israel<S>3478</S> must die<S>4191</S>: and he called<S>7121</S> his son<S>1121</S> Joseph<S>3130</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, If now I have found<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in thy sight<S>5869</S>, put<S>7760</S>, I pray thee, thy hand<S>3027</S> under my thigh<S>3409</S>, and deal<S>6213</S> kindly<S>2617</S> and truly<S>571</S> with me; bury<S>6912</S> me not, I pray thee, in Egypt<S>4714</S>:
But I will lie<S>7901</S> with my fathers<S>1</S>, and thou shalt carry<S>5375</S> me out of Egypt<S>4714</S>, and bury<S>6912</S> me in their buryingplace<S>6900</S>. And he said<S>559</S>, I will do<S>6213</S> as thou hast said<S>1697</S>.
And he said<S>559</S>, Swear<S>7650</S> unto me. And he sware<S>7650</S> unto him. And Israel<S>3478</S> bowed<S>7812</S> himself upon the bed's<S>4296</S> head<S>7218</S>.

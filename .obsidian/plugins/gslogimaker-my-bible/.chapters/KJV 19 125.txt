A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S>. They that trust<S>982</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> shall be as mount<S>2022</S> Zion<S>6726</S>, which cannot be removed<S>4131</S>, but abideth<S>3427</S> for ever<S>5769</S>.
As the mountains<S>2022</S> are round about<S>5439</S> Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, so the LORD<S>3068</S> is round about<S>5439</S> his people<S>5971</S> from henceforth even for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>.
For the rod<S>7626</S> of the wicked<S>7562</S> shall not rest<S>5117</S> upon the lot<S>1486</S> of the righteous<S>6662</S>; lest<S>4616</S> the righteous<S>6662</S> put forth<S>7971</S> their hands<S>3027</S> unto iniquity<S>5766</S>. <sup>the wicked: Heb. wickedness</sup>
Do good<S>2895</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, unto those that be good<S>2896</S>, and to them that are upright<S>3477</S> in their hearts<S>3826</S>.
As for such as turn aside<S>5186</S> unto their crooked ways<S>6128</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> shall lead them forth<S>3212</S> with the workers<S>6466</S> of iniquity<S>205</S>: but peace<S>7965</S> shall be upon Israel<S>3478</S>.

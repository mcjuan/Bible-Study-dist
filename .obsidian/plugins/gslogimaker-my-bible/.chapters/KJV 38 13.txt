In that day<S>3117</S> there shall be a fountain<S>4726</S> opened<S>6605</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S> and to the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> for sin<S>2403</S> and for uncleanness<S>5079</S>. <sup>uncleanness: Heb. separation for uncleanness</sup>
And it shall come to pass in that day<S>3117</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, that I will cut off<S>3772</S> the names<S>8034</S> of the idols<S>6091</S> out of the land<S>776</S>, and they shall no more be remembered<S>2142</S>: and also I will cause the prophets<S>5030</S> and the unclean<S>2932</S> spirit<S>7307</S> to pass<S>5674</S> out of the land<S>776</S>.
And it shall come to pass, that when any<S>376</S> shall yet prophesy<S>5012</S>, then his father<S>1</S> and his mother<S>517</S> that begat<S>3205</S> him shall say<S>559</S> unto him, Thou shalt not live<S>2421</S>; for thou speakest<S>1696</S> lies<S>8267</S> in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: and his father<S>1</S> and his mother<S>517</S> that begat<S>3205</S> him shall thrust<S>1856</S> him through when he prophesieth<S>5012</S>.
And it shall come to pass in that day<S>3117</S>, that the prophets<S>5030</S> shall be ashamed<S>954</S> every one<S>376</S> of his vision<S>2384</S>, when he hath prophesied<S>5012</S>; neither shall they wear<S>3847</S> a rough<S>8181</S> garment<S>155</S> to deceive<S>3584</S>: <sup>a rough: Heb. a garment of hair</sup> <sup>deceive: Heb. lie</sup>
But he shall say<S>559</S>, I am no prophet<S>5030</S>, I am an husbandman<S>376</S> <S>5647</S> <S>127</S>; for man<S>120</S> taught me to keep cattle<S>7069</S> from my youth<S>5271</S>.
And one shall say<S>559</S> unto him, What are these wounds<S>4347</S> in thine hands<S>3027</S>? Then he shall answer<S>559</S>, Those with which I was wounded<S>5221</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of my friends<S>157</S>.
Awake<S>5782</S>, O sword<S>2719</S>, against my shepherd<S>7462</S>, and against the man<S>1397</S> that is my fellow<S>5997</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>: smite<S>5221</S> the shepherd<S>7462</S>, and the sheep<S>6629</S> shall be scattered<S>6327</S>: and I will turn<S>7725</S> mine hand<S>3027</S> upon the little ones<S>6819</S>.
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land<S>776</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, two<S>8147</S> parts<S>6310</S> therein shall be cut off<S>3772</S> and die<S>1478</S>; but the third<S>7992</S> shall be left<S>3498</S> therein.
And I will bring<S>935</S> the third part<S>7992</S> through the fire<S>784</S>, and will refine<S>6884</S> them as silver<S>3701</S> is refined<S>6884</S>, and will try<S>974</S> them as gold<S>2091</S> is tried<S>974</S>: they shall call<S>7121</S> on my name<S>8034</S>, and I will hear<S>6030</S> them: I will say<S>559</S>, It is my people<S>5971</S>: and they shall say<S>559</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> is my God<S>430</S>.

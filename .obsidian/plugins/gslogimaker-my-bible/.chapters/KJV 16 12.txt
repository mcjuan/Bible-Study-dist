And at the fountain<S>5869</S> gate<S>8179</S>, which was over against them, they went up<S>5927</S> by the stairs<S>4609</S> of the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S>, at the going up<S>4608</S> of the wall<S>2346</S>, above the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S>, even unto the water<S>4325</S> gate<S>8179</S> eastward<S>4217</S>.
And the other<S>8145</S> company of them that gave thanks<S>8426</S> went<S>1980</S> over against<S>4136</S> them, and I after<S>310</S> them, and the half<S>2677</S> of the people<S>5971</S> upon the wall<S>2346</S>, from beyond the tower<S>4026</S> of the furnaces<S>8574</S> even unto the broad<S>7342</S> wall<S>2346</S>;

So stood<S>5975</S> the two<S>8147</S> companies of them that gave thanks<S>8426</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>, and I, and the half<S>2677</S> of the rulers<S>5461</S> with me:

Also that day<S>3117</S> they offered<S>2076</S> great<S>1419</S> sacrifices<S>2077</S>, and rejoiced<S>8055</S>: for God<S>430</S> had made them rejoice<S>8055</S> with great<S>1419</S> joy<S>8057</S>: the wives<S>802</S> also and the children<S>3206</S> rejoiced<S>8055</S>: so that the joy<S>8057</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> was heard<S>8085</S> even afar off<S>7350</S>.
And at that time<S>3117</S> were some<S>582</S> appointed<S>6485</S> over the chambers<S>5393</S> for the treasures<S>214</S>, for the offerings<S>8641</S>, for the firstfruits<S>7225</S>, and for the tithes<S>4643</S>, to gather<S>3664</S> into them out of the fields<S>7704</S> of the cities<S>5892</S> the portions<S>4521</S> of the law<S>8451</S> for the priests<S>3548</S> and Levites<S>3881</S>: for Judah<S>3063</S> rejoiced<S>8057</S> for the priests<S>3548</S> and for the Levites<S>3881</S> that waited<S>5975</S>. <sup>of the law: that is, appointed by the law</sup> <sup>for Judah: Heb. for the joy of Judah</sup> <sup>waited: Heb. stood</sup>

And it came to pass after<S>310</S> this, that Absalom<S>53</S> the son<S>1121</S> of David<S>1732</S> had a fair<S>3303</S> sister<S>269</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Tamar<S>8559</S>; and Amnon<S>550</S> the son<S>1121</S> of David<S>1732</S> loved<S>157</S> her.
And Amnon<S>550</S> was so vexed<S>3334</S>, that he fell sick<S>2470</S> for his sister<S>269</S> Tamar<S>8559</S>; for she was a virgin<S>1330</S>; and Amnon<S>550</S> thought<S>5869</S> it hard<S>6381</S> for him to do<S>6213</S> any thing<S>3972</S> to her. <sup>Amnon thought: Heb. it was marvellous, or, hidden in the eyes of Amnon</sup>
But Amnon<S>550</S> had a friend<S>7453</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Jonadab<S>3122</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Shimeah<S>8093</S> David's<S>1732</S> brother<S>251</S>: and Jonadab<S>3122</S> was a very<S>3966</S> subtil<S>2450</S> man<S>376</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Why art thou, being the king's<S>4428</S> son<S>1121</S>, lean<S>1800</S> from day<S>1242</S> to day<S>1242</S>? wilt thou not tell<S>5046</S> me? And Amnon<S>550</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, I love<S>157</S> Tamar<S>8559</S>, my brother<S>251</S> Absalom's<S>53</S> sister<S>269</S>. <sup>lean: Heb. thin</sup> <sup>from day: Heb. morning by morning</sup>
And Jonadab<S>3082</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Lay thee down<S>7901</S> on thy bed<S>4904</S>, and make thyself sick<S>2470</S>: and when thy father<S>1</S> cometh<S>935</S> to see<S>7200</S> thee, say<S>559</S> unto him, I pray thee, let my sister<S>269</S> Tamar<S>8559</S> come<S>935</S>, and give<S>1262</S> me meat<S>3899</S>, and dress<S>6213</S> the meat<S>1279</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>, that I may see<S>7200</S> it, and eat<S>398</S> it at her hand<S>3027</S>.
So Amnon<S>550</S> lay down<S>7901</S>, and made himself sick<S>2470</S>: and when the king<S>4428</S> was come<S>935</S> to see<S>7200</S> him, Amnon<S>550</S> said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, I pray thee, let Tamar<S>8559</S> my sister<S>269</S> come<S>935</S>, and make<S>3823</S> me a couple<S>8147</S> of cakes<S>3834</S> in my sight<S>5869</S>, that I may eat<S>1262</S> at her hand<S>3027</S>.
Then David<S>1732</S> sent<S>7971</S> home<S>1004</S> to Tamar<S>8559</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S> now to thy brother<S>251</S> Amnon's<S>550</S> house<S>1004</S>, and dress<S>6213</S> him meat<S>1279</S>.
So Tamar<S>8559</S> went<S>3212</S> to her brother<S>251</S> Amnon's<S>550</S> house<S>1004</S>; and he was laid down<S>7901</S>. And she took<S>3947</S> flour<S>1217</S>, and kneaded<S>3888</S> it, and made cakes<S>3823</S> in his sight<S>5869</S>, and did bake<S>1310</S> the cakes<S>3834</S>. <sup>flour: or, paste</sup>
And she took<S>3947</S> a pan<S>4958</S>, and poured them out<S>3332</S> before<S>6440</S> him; but he refused<S>3985</S> to eat<S>398</S>. And Amnon<S>550</S> said<S>559</S>, Have out<S>3318</S> all men<S>376</S> from me. And they went out<S>3318</S> every man<S>376</S> from him.
And Amnon<S>550</S> said<S>559</S> unto Tamar<S>8559</S>, Bring<S>935</S> the meat<S>1279</S> into the chamber<S>2315</S>, that I may eat<S>1262</S> of thine hand<S>3027</S>. And Tamar<S>8559</S> took<S>3947</S> the cakes<S>3834</S> which she had made<S>6213</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them into the chamber<S>2315</S> to Amnon<S>550</S> her brother<S>251</S>.
And when she had brought<S>5066</S> them unto him to eat<S>398</S>, he took hold<S>2388</S> of her, and said<S>559</S> unto her, Come<S>935</S> lie<S>7901</S> with me, my sister<S>269</S>.
And she answered<S>559</S> him, Nay, my brother<S>251</S>, do not force<S>6031</S> me; for no such thing ought<S>3651</S> to be done<S>6213</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>: do<S>6213</S> not thou this folly<S>5039</S>. <sup>force: Heb. humble me</sup> <sup>no such: Heb. it ought not so to be done</sup>
And I, whither shall I cause my shame<S>2781</S> to go<S>3212</S>? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one<S>259</S> of the fools<S>5036</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak<S>1696</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>; for he will not withhold<S>4513</S> me from thee.
Howbeit he would<S>14</S> not hearken<S>8085</S> unto her voice<S>6963</S>: but, being stronger<S>2388</S> than she, forced<S>6031</S> her, and lay<S>7901</S> with her.
Then Amnon<S>550</S> hated<S>8130</S> her exceedingly<S>3966</S> <S>1419</S>; so that the hatred<S>8135</S> wherewith he hated<S>8130</S> her was greater<S>1419</S> than the love<S>160</S> wherewith he had loved<S>157</S> her. And Amnon<S>550</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Arise<S>6965</S>, be gone<S>3212</S>. <sup>exceedingly: Heb. with great hatred greatly</sup>
And she said<S>559</S> unto him, There is no cause<S>182</S>: this evil<S>7451</S> in sending me away<S>7971</S> is greater<S>1419</S> than the other<S>312</S> that thou didst<S>6213</S> unto me. But he would<S>14</S> not hearken<S>8085</S> unto her.
Then he called<S>7121</S> his servant<S>5288</S> that ministered<S>8334</S> unto him, and said<S>559</S>, Put<S>7971</S> now this woman out<S>2351</S> from me, and bolt<S>5274</S> the door<S>1817</S> after<S>310</S> her.
And she had a garment<S>3801</S> of divers colours<S>6446</S> upon her: for with such robes<S>4598</S> were the king's<S>4428</S> daughters<S>1323</S> that were virgins<S>1330</S> apparelled<S>3847</S>. Then his servant<S>8334</S> brought<S>3318</S> her out<S>2351</S>, and bolted<S>5274</S> the door<S>1817</S> after<S>310</S> her.
And Tamar<S>8559</S> put<S>3947</S> ashes<S>665</S> on her head<S>7218</S>, and rent<S>7167</S> her garment<S>3801</S> of divers colours<S>6446</S> that was on her, and laid<S>7760</S> her hand<S>3027</S> on her head<S>7218</S>, and went<S>3212</S> on<S>1980</S> crying<S>2199</S>.
And Absalom<S>53</S> her brother<S>251</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, Hath Amnon<S>550</S> thy brother<S>251</S> been with thee? but hold now thy peace<S>2790</S>, my sister<S>269</S>: he is thy brother<S>251</S>; regard<S>7896</S> <S>3820</S> not this thing<S>1697</S>. So Tamar<S>8559</S> remained<S>3427</S> desolate<S>8074</S> in her brother<S>251</S> Absalom's<S>53</S> house<S>1004</S>. <sup>Amnon: Heb. Aminon</sup> <sup>regard: Heb. set not thy heart</sup> <sup>desolate: Heb. and desolate</sup>
But when king<S>4428</S> David<S>1732</S> heard<S>8085</S> of all these things<S>1697</S>, he was very<S>3966</S> wroth<S>2734</S>.
And Absalom<S>53</S> spake<S>1696</S> unto his brother Amnon<S>550</S> neither good<S>2896</S> nor bad<S>7451</S>: for Absalom<S>53</S> hated<S>8130</S> Amnon<S>550</S>, because<S>1697</S> he had forced<S>6031</S> his sister<S>269</S> Tamar<S>8559</S>.
And it came to pass after two full<S>3117</S> years<S>8141</S>, that Absalom<S>53</S> had sheepshearers<S>1494</S> in Baalhazor<S>1178</S>, which is beside Ephraim<S>669</S>: and Absalom<S>53</S> invited<S>7121</S> all the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S>.
And Absalom<S>53</S> came<S>935</S> to the king<S>4428</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold now, thy servant<S>5650</S> hath sheepshearers<S>1494</S>; let<S>3212</S> the king<S>4428</S>, I beseech thee, and his servants<S>5650</S> go<S>3212</S> with thy servant<S>5650</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> to Absalom<S>53</S>, Nay, my son<S>1121</S>, let us not all now go<S>3212</S>, lest we be chargeable<S>3513</S> unto thee. And he pressed<S>6555</S> him: howbeit he would<S>14</S> not go<S>3212</S>, but blessed<S>1288</S> him.
Then said<S>559</S> Absalom<S>53</S>, If not, I pray thee, let my brother<S>251</S> Amnon<S>550</S> go<S>3212</S> with us. And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Why should he go<S>3212</S> with thee?
But Absalom<S>53</S> pressed<S>6555</S> him, that he let Amnon<S>550</S> and all the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> go<S>7971</S> with him.
Now Absalom<S>53</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> his servants<S>5288</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Mark<S>7200</S> ye now when Amnon's<S>550</S> heart<S>3820</S> is merry<S>2896</S> with wine<S>3196</S>, and when I say<S>559</S> unto you, Smite<S>5221</S> Amnon<S>550</S>; then kill<S>4191</S> him, fear<S>3372</S> not: have not I commanded<S>6680</S> you? be courageous<S>2388</S>, and be valiant<S>1121</S> <S>2428</S>. <sup>have: or, will you not, since I have commanded you?</sup> <sup>valiant: Heb. sons of valour</sup>
And the servants<S>5288</S> of Absalom<S>53</S> did<S>6213</S> unto Amnon<S>550</S> as Absalom<S>53</S> had commanded<S>6680</S>. Then all the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and every man<S>376</S> gat him up<S>7392</S> upon his mule<S>6505</S>, and fled<S>5127</S>. <sup>gat: Heb. rode</sup>
And it came to pass, while they were in the way<S>1870</S>, that tidings<S>8052</S> came<S>935</S> to David<S>1732</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Absalom<S>53</S> hath slain<S>5221</S> all the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S>, and there is not one<S>259</S> of them left<S>3498</S>.
Then the king<S>4428</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and tare<S>7167</S> his garments<S>899</S>, and lay<S>7901</S> on the earth<S>776</S>; and all his servants<S>5650</S> stood<S>5324</S> by with their clothes<S>899</S> rent<S>7167</S>.
And Jonadab<S>3122</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Shimeah<S>8093</S> David's<S>1732</S> brother<S>251</S>, answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, Let not my lord<S>113</S> suppose<S>559</S> that they have slain<S>4191</S> all the young men<S>5288</S> the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S>; for Amnon<S>550</S> only is dead<S>4191</S>: for by the appointment<S>6310</S> of Absalom<S>53</S> this hath been determined<S>7760</S> from the day<S>3117</S> that he forced<S>6031</S> his sister<S>269</S> Tamar<S>8559</S>. <sup>appointment: Heb. mouth</sup> <sup>determined: or, settled</sup>
Now therefore let not my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S> take<S>7760</S> the thing<S>1697</S> to his heart<S>3820</S>, to think<S>559</S> that all the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> are dead<S>4191</S>: for Amnon<S>550</S> only is dead<S>4191</S>.
But Absalom<S>53</S> fled<S>1272</S>. And the young man<S>5288</S> that kept the watch<S>6822</S> lifted up<S>5375</S> his eyes<S>5869</S>, and looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, there came<S>1980</S> much<S>7227</S> people<S>5971</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the hill<S>2022</S> side<S>6654</S> behind<S>310</S> him.
And Jonadab<S>3122</S> said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, Behold, the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> come<S>935</S>: as thy servant<S>5650</S> said<S>1697</S>, so it is. <sup>as thy: Heb. according to the word of thy servant</sup>
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end<S>3615</S> of speaking<S>1696</S>, that, behold, the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S> came<S>935</S>, and lifted up<S>5375</S> their voice<S>6963</S> and wept<S>1058</S>: and the king<S>4428</S> also and all his servants<S>5650</S> wept<S>1058</S> very<S>3966</S> sore<S>1065</S> <S>1419</S>. <sup>very: Heb. with a great weeping greatly</sup>
But Absalom<S>53</S> fled<S>1272</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to Talmai<S>8526</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Ammihud<S>5991</S> <S>5989</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Geshur<S>1650</S>. And David mourned<S>56</S> for his son<S>1121</S> every day<S>3117</S>. <sup>Ammihud: or, Ammihur</sup>
So Absalom<S>53</S> fled<S>1272</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to Geshur<S>1650</S>, and was there three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S>.
And the soul of king<S>4428</S> David<S>1732</S> longed<S>3615</S> to go forth<S>3318</S> unto Absalom<S>53</S>: for he was comforted<S>5162</S> concerning Amnon<S>550</S>, seeing he was dead<S>4191</S>. <sup>longed: or, was consumed</sup>

Now these are the names<S>8034</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which came<S>935</S> into Egypt<S>4714</S>; every man<S>376</S> and his household<S>1004</S> came<S>935</S> with Jacob<S>3290</S>.
Reuben<S>7205</S>, Simeon<S>8095</S>, Levi<S>3878</S>, and Judah<S>3063</S>,
Issachar<S>3485</S>, Zebulun<S>2074</S>, and Benjamin<S>1144</S>,
Dan<S>1835</S>, and Naphtali<S>5321</S>, Gad<S>1410</S>, and Asher<S>836</S>.
And all the souls<S>5315</S> that came out<S>3318</S> of the loins<S>3409</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> were seventy<S>7657</S> souls<S>5315</S>: for Joseph<S>3130</S> was in Egypt<S>4714</S> already. <sup>loins: Heb. thigh</sup>
And Joseph<S>3130</S> died<S>4191</S>, and all his brethren<S>251</S>, and all that generation<S>1755</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> were fruitful<S>6509</S>, and increased abundantly<S>8317</S>, and multiplied<S>7235</S>, and waxed exceeding<S>3966</S> <S>3966</S> mighty<S>6105</S>; and the land<S>776</S> was filled<S>4390</S> with them.
Now there arose up<S>6965</S> a new<S>2319</S> king<S>4428</S> over Egypt<S>4714</S>, which knew<S>3045</S> not Joseph<S>3130</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his people<S>5971</S>, Behold, the people<S>5971</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> are more<S>7227</S> and mightier<S>6099</S> than we:
Come on<S>3051</S>, let us deal wisely<S>2449</S> with them; lest they multiply<S>7235</S>, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out<S>7122</S> any war<S>4421</S>, they<S>1931</S> join<S>3254</S> also unto our enemies<S>8130</S>, and fight<S>3898</S> against us, and so get them up<S>5927</S> out of the land<S>776</S>.
Therefore they did set<S>7760</S> over them taskmasters<S>4522</S> <S>8269</S> to afflict<S>6031</S> them with their burdens<S>5450</S>. And they built<S>1129</S> for Pharaoh<S>6547</S> treasure<S>4543</S> cities<S>5892</S>, Pithom<S>6619</S> and Raamses<S>7486</S>.
But the more they afflicted<S>6031</S> them, the more<S>3651</S> they multiplied<S>7235</S> and grew<S>6555</S>. And they were grieved<S>6973</S> because<S>6440</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>But: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc</sup>
And the Egyptians<S>4714</S> made<S>5647</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to serve<S>5647</S> with rigour<S>6531</S>:
And they made<S>4843</S> their lives<S>2416</S> bitter<S>4843</S> with hard<S>7186</S> bondage<S>5656</S>, in morter<S>2563</S>, and in brick<S>3843</S>, and in all manner of service<S>5656</S> in the field<S>7704</S>: all their service<S>5656</S>, wherein they made them serve<S>5647</S>, was with rigour<S>6531</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> spake<S>559</S> to the Hebrew<S>5680</S> midwives<S>3205</S>, of which the name<S>8034</S> of the one<S>259</S> was Shiphrah<S>8236</S>, and the name<S>8034</S> of the other<S>8145</S> Puah<S>6326</S>:
And he said<S>559</S>, When ye do the office of a midwife<S>3205</S> to the Hebrew women<S>5680</S>, and see<S>7200</S> them upon the stools<S>70</S>; if it be a son<S>1121</S>, then ye shall kill<S>4191</S> him: but if it be a daughter<S>1323</S>, then she shall live<S>2425</S>.
But the midwives<S>3205</S> feared<S>3372</S> God<S>430</S>, and did<S>6213</S> not as the king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> commanded<S>1696</S> them, but saved<S>2421</S> the men children<S>3206</S> alive<S>2421</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> called<S>7121</S> for the midwives<S>3205</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Why<S>4069</S> have ye done<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S>, and have saved<S>2421</S> the men children<S>3206</S> alive<S>2421</S>?
And the midwives<S>3205</S> said<S>559</S> unto Pharaoh<S>6547</S>, Because the Hebrew<S>5680</S> women<S>802</S> are not as the Egyptian women<S>4713</S>; for they are lively<S>2422</S>, and are delivered<S>3205</S> ere<S>2962</S> the midwives<S>3205</S> come in<S>935</S> unto them.
Therefore God<S>430</S> dealt well<S>3190</S> with the midwives<S>3205</S>: and the people<S>5971</S> multiplied<S>7235</S>, and waxed very<S>3966</S> mighty<S>6105</S>.
And it came to pass, because the midwives<S>3205</S> feared<S>3372</S> God<S>430</S>, that he made<S>6213</S> them houses<S>1004</S>.
And Pharaoh<S>6547</S> charged<S>6680</S> all his people<S>5971</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Every son<S>1121</S> that is born<S>3209</S> ye shall cast<S>7993</S> into the river<S>2975</S>, and every daughter<S>1323</S> ye shall save alive<S>2421</S>.

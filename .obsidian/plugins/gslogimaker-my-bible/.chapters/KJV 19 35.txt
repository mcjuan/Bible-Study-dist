A Psalm of David<S>1732</S>. Plead<S>7378</S> my cause, O LORD<S>3068</S>, with them that strive<S>3401</S> with me: fight<S>3898</S> against them that fight<S>3898</S> against me.
Take hold<S>2388</S> of shield<S>4043</S> and buckler<S>6793</S>, and stand up<S>6965</S> for mine help<S>5833</S>.
Draw out<S>7324</S> also the spear<S>2595</S>, and stop<S>5462</S> the way against<S>7125</S> them that persecute<S>7291</S> me: say<S>559</S> unto my soul<S>5315</S>, I am thy salvation<S>3444</S>.
Let them be confounded<S>954</S> and put to shame<S>3637</S> that seek<S>1245</S> after my soul<S>5315</S>: let them be turned<S>5472</S> back<S>268</S> and brought to confusion<S>2659</S> that devise<S>2803</S> my hurt<S>7451</S>.
Let them be as chaff<S>4671</S> before<S>6440</S> the wind<S>7307</S>: and let the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> chase<S>1760</S> them.
Let their way<S>1870</S> be dark<S>2822</S> and slippery<S>2519</S>: and let the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> persecute<S>7291</S> them. <sup>dark: Heb. darkness and slipperiness</sup>
For without cause<S>2600</S> have they hid<S>2934</S> for me their net<S>7568</S> in a pit<S>7845</S>, which without cause<S>2600</S> they have digged<S>2658</S> for my soul<S>5315</S>.
Let destruction<S>7722</S> come<S>935</S> upon him at unawares<S>3045</S> <S>3808</S>; and let his net<S>7568</S> that he hath hid<S>2934</S> catch<S>3920</S> himself: into that very destruction<S>7722</S> let him fall<S>5307</S>. <sup>at: Heb. which he knoweth not of</sup>
And my soul<S>5315</S> shall be joyful<S>1523</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S>: it shall rejoice<S>7797</S> in his salvation<S>3444</S>.
All my bones<S>6106</S> shall say<S>559</S>, LORD<S>3068</S>, who is like unto thee, which deliverest<S>5337</S> the poor<S>6041</S> from him that is too strong<S>2389</S> for him, yea, the poor<S>6041</S> and the needy<S>34</S> from him that spoileth<S>1497</S> him?
False<S>2555</S> witnesses<S>5707</S> did rise up<S>6965</S>; they laid to my charge<S>7592</S> things that I knew<S>3045</S> not. <sup>False: Heb. Witnesses of wrong</sup> <sup>they: Heb. they asked me</sup>
They rewarded<S>7999</S> me evil<S>7451</S> for good<S>2896</S> to the spoiling<S>7908</S> of my soul<S>5315</S>. <sup>spoiling: Heb. depriving</sup>
But as for me, when they were sick<S>2470</S>, my clothing<S>3830</S> was sackcloth<S>8242</S>: I humbled<S>6031</S> my soul<S>5315</S> with fasting<S>6685</S>; and my prayer<S>8605</S> returned<S>7725</S> into mine own bosom<S>2436</S>. <sup>humbled: or, afflicted</sup>
I behaved<S>1980</S> myself as though he had been my friend<S>7453</S> or brother<S>251</S>: I bowed down<S>7817</S> heavily<S>6937</S>, as one that mourneth<S>57</S> for his mother<S>517</S>. <sup>behaved myself: Heb. walked</sup> <sup>as though: Heb. as a friend, as a brother to me</sup>
But in mine adversity<S>6761</S> they rejoiced<S>8055</S>, and gathered themselves together<S>622</S>: yea, the abjects<S>5222</S> gathered themselves together<S>622</S> against me, and I knew<S>3045</S> it not; they did tear<S>7167</S> me, and ceased<S>1826</S> not: <sup>adversity: Heb. halting</sup>
With hypocritical<S>2611</S> mockers<S>3934</S> in feasts<S>4580</S>, they gnashed<S>2786</S> upon me with their teeth<S>8127</S>.
Lord<S>136</S>, how long wilt thou look on<S>7200</S>? rescue<S>7725</S> my soul<S>5315</S> from their destructions<S>7722</S>, my darling<S>3173</S> from the lions<S>3715</S>. <sup>darling: Heb. only one</sup>
I will give thee thanks<S>3034</S> in the great<S>7227</S> congregation<S>6951</S>: I will praise<S>1984</S> thee among much<S>6099</S> people<S>5971</S>. <sup>much: Heb. strong</sup>
Let not them that are mine enemies<S>341</S> wrongfully<S>8267</S> rejoice<S>8055</S> over me: neither let them wink<S>7169</S> with the eye<S>5869</S> that hate<S>8130</S> me without a cause<S>2600</S>. <sup>wrongfully: Heb. falsely</sup>
For they speak<S>1696</S> not peace<S>7965</S>: but they devise<S>2803</S> deceitful<S>4820</S> matters<S>1697</S> against them that are quiet<S>7282</S> in the land<S>776</S>.
Yea, they opened their mouth<S>6310</S> wide<S>7337</S> against me, and said<S>559</S>, Aha<S>1889</S>, aha<S>1889</S>, our eye<S>5869</S> hath seen<S>7200</S> it.
This thou hast seen<S>7200</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>: keep not silence<S>2790</S>: O Lord<S>136</S>, be not far<S>7368</S> from me.
Stir up<S>5782</S> thyself, and awake<S>6974</S> to my judgment<S>4941</S>, even unto my cause<S>7379</S>, my God<S>430</S> and my Lord<S>136</S>.
Judge<S>8199</S> me, O LORD<S>3068</S> my God<S>430</S>, according to thy righteousness<S>6664</S>; and let them not rejoice<S>8055</S> over me.
Let them not say<S>559</S> in their hearts<S>3820</S>, Ah<S>1889</S>, so would we have it<S>5315</S>: let them not say<S>559</S>, We have swallowed him up<S>1104</S>. <sup>Ah: Heb. Ah, ah, our soul</sup>
Let them be ashamed<S>954</S> and brought to confusion<S>2659</S> together<S>3162</S> that rejoice<S>8056</S> at mine hurt<S>7451</S>: let them be clothed<S>3847</S> with shame<S>1322</S> and dishonour<S>3639</S> that magnify<S>1431</S> themselves against me.
Let them shout for joy<S>7442</S>, and be glad<S>8055</S>, that favour<S>2655</S> my righteous cause<S>6664</S>: yea, let them say<S>559</S> continually<S>8548</S>, Let the LORD<S>3068</S> be magnified<S>1431</S>, which hath pleasure<S>2655</S> in the prosperity<S>7965</S> of his servant<S>5650</S>. <sup>righteous: Heb. righteousness</sup>
And my tongue<S>3956</S> shall speak<S>1897</S> of thy righteousness<S>6664</S> and of thy praise<S>8416</S> all the day<S>3117</S> long.

And Moses<S>4872</S> sent<S>7971</S> them to the war<S>6635</S>, a thousand<S>505</S> of every tribe<S>4294</S>, them and Phinehas<S>6372</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Eleazar<S>499</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, to the war<S>6635</S>, with the holy<S>6944</S> instruments<S>3627</S>, and the trumpets<S>2689</S> to blow<S>8643</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.

And they slew<S>2026</S> the kings<S>4428</S> of Midian<S>4080</S>, beside<S>5921</S> the rest of them that were slain<S>2491</S>; namely, Evi<S>189</S>, and Rekem<S>7552</S>, and Zur<S>6698</S>, and Hur<S>2354</S>, and Reba<S>7254</S>, five<S>2568</S> kings<S>4428</S> of Midian<S>4080</S>: Balaam<S>1109</S> also the son<S>1121</S> of Beor<S>1160</S> they slew<S>2026</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>.
And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> took all the women<S>802</S> of Midian<S>4080</S> captives<S>7617</S>, and their little ones<S>2945</S>, and took the spoil<S>962</S> of all their cattle<S>929</S>, and all their flocks<S>4735</S>, and all their goods<S>2428</S>.
And they burnt<S>8313</S> all their cities<S>5892</S> wherein they dwelt<S>4186</S>, and all their goodly castles<S>2918</S>, with fire<S>784</S>.

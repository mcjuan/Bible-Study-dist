And Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S> sent<S>7971</S> out of Shittim<S>7851</S> two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> to spy<S>7270</S> secretly<S>2791</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Go<S>3212</S> view<S>7200</S> the land<S>776</S>, even Jericho<S>3405</S>. And they went<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> into an harlot's<S>2181</S> house<S>802</S> <S>1004</S>, named<S>8034</S> Rahab<S>7343</S>, and lodged<S>7901</S> there. <sup>sent: or, had sent</sup> <sup>lodged: Heb. lay</sup>
And it was told<S>559</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, there came<S>935</S> men<S>582</S> in hither to night<S>3915</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to search out<S>2658</S> the country<S>776</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S> sent<S>7971</S> unto Rahab<S>7343</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Bring forth<S>3318</S> the men<S>582</S> that are come<S>935</S> to thee, which are entered<S>935</S> into thine house<S>1004</S>: for they be come<S>935</S> to search out<S>2658</S> all the country<S>776</S>.
And the woman<S>802</S> took<S>3947</S> the two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S>, and hid<S>6845</S> them, and said<S>559</S> thus, There came<S>935</S> men<S>582</S> unto me, but I wist<S>3045</S> not whence<S>370</S> they were:
And it came to pass about the time of shutting<S>5462</S> of the gate<S>8179</S>, when it was dark<S>2822</S>, that the men<S>582</S> went out<S>3318</S>: whither the men<S>582</S> went<S>1980</S> I wot<S>3045</S> not: pursue<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> them quickly<S>4118</S>; for ye shall overtake<S>5381</S> them.
But she had brought them up<S>5927</S> to the roof<S>1406</S> of the house, and hid<S>2934</S> them with the stalks<S>6086</S> of flax<S>6593</S>, which she had laid in order<S>6186</S> upon the roof<S>1406</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> them the way<S>1870</S> to Jordan<S>3383</S> unto the fords<S>4569</S>: and as soon as they which pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> them were gone out<S>3318</S>, they shut<S>5462</S> the gate<S>8179</S>.
And before they were laid down<S>7901</S>, she came up<S>5927</S> unto them upon the roof<S>1406</S>;
And she said<S>559</S> unto the men<S>582</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> you the land<S>776</S>, and that your terror<S>367</S> is fallen<S>5307</S> upon us, and that all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the land<S>776</S> faint<S>4127</S> because<S>6440</S> of you. <sup>faint: Heb. melt</sup>
For we have heard<S>8085</S> how the LORD<S>3068</S> dried up<S>3001</S> the water<S>4325</S> of the Red<S>5488</S> sea<S>3220</S> for you<S>6440</S>, when ye came out<S>3318</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>; and what ye did<S>6213</S> unto the two<S>8147</S> kings<S>4428</S> of the Amorites<S>567</S>, that were on the other side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S>, Sihon<S>5511</S> and Og<S>5747</S>, whom ye utterly destroyed<S>2763</S>.
And as soon as we had heard<S>8085</S> these things, our hearts<S>3824</S> did melt<S>4549</S>, neither did there remain<S>6965</S> any more courage<S>7307</S> in any man<S>376</S>, because<S>6440</S> of you: for the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, he is God<S>430</S> in heaven<S>8064</S> above<S>4605</S>, and in earth<S>776</S> beneath. <sup>did there: Heb. rose up</sup>
Now therefore, I pray you, swear<S>7650</S> unto me by the LORD<S>3068</S>, since<S>3588</S> I have shewed<S>6213</S> you kindness<S>2617</S>, that ye will also shew<S>6213</S> kindness<S>2617</S> unto my father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S>, and give<S>5414</S> me a true<S>571</S> token<S>226</S>:
And that ye will save alive<S>2421</S> my father<S>1</S>, and my mother<S>517</S>, and my brethren<S>251</S>, and my sisters<S>269</S>, and all that they have, and deliver<S>5337</S> our lives<S>5315</S> from death<S>4194</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> answered<S>559</S> her, Our life<S>5315</S> for yours<S>4191</S>, if ye utter<S>5046</S> not this our business<S>1697</S>. And it shall be, when the LORD<S>3068</S> hath given<S>5414</S> us the land<S>776</S>, that we will deal<S>6213</S> kindly<S>2617</S> and truly<S>571</S> with thee. <sup>for: Heb. instead of you to die</sup>
Then she let them down<S>3381</S> by a cord<S>2256</S> through<S>1157</S> the window<S>2474</S>: for her house<S>1004</S> was upon the town<S>7023</S> wall<S>2346</S>, and she dwelt<S>3427</S> upon the wall<S>2346</S>.
And she said<S>559</S> unto them, Get<S>3212</S> you to the mountain<S>2022</S>, lest the pursuers<S>7291</S> meet<S>6293</S> you; and hide<S>2247</S> yourselves there three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>, until the pursuers<S>7291</S> be returned<S>7725</S>: and afterward<S>310</S> may ye go<S>3212</S> your way<S>1870</S>.
And the men<S>582</S> said<S>559</S> unto her, We will be blameless<S>5355</S> of this thine oath<S>7621</S> which thou hast made us swear<S>7650</S>.
Behold, when we come<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S>, thou shalt bind<S>7194</S> this line<S>8615</S> of scarlet<S>8144</S> thread<S>2339</S> in the window<S>2474</S> which thou didst let us down by<S>3381</S>: and thou shalt bring<S>622</S> thy father<S>1</S>, and thy mother<S>517</S>, and thy brethren<S>251</S>, and all thy father's<S>1</S> household<S>1004</S>, home<S>1004</S> unto thee. <sup>bring: Heb. gather</sup>
And it shall be, that whosoever<S>834</S> shall go out<S>3318</S> of the doors<S>1817</S> of thy house<S>1004</S> into the street<S>2351</S>, his blood<S>1818</S> shall be upon his head<S>7218</S>, and we will be guiltless<S>5355</S>: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house<S>1004</S>, his blood<S>1818</S> shall be on our head<S>7218</S>, if any hand<S>3027</S> be upon him.
And if thou utter<S>5046</S> this our business<S>1697</S>, then we will be quit<S>5355</S> of thine oath<S>7621</S> which thou hast made us to swear<S>7650</S>.
And she said<S>559</S>, According unto your words<S>1697</S>, so be it. And she sent them away<S>7971</S>, and they departed<S>3212</S>: and she bound<S>7194</S> the scarlet<S>8144</S> line<S>8615</S> in the window<S>2474</S>.
And they went<S>3212</S>, and came<S>935</S> unto the mountain<S>2022</S>, and abode<S>3427</S> there three<S>7969</S> days<S>3117</S>, until the pursuers<S>7291</S> were returned<S>7725</S>: and the pursuers<S>7291</S> sought<S>1245</S> them throughout all the way<S>1870</S>, but found<S>4672</S> them not.
So the two<S>8147</S> men<S>582</S> returned<S>7725</S>, and descended<S>3381</S> from the mountain<S>2022</S>, and passed over<S>5674</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nun<S>5126</S>, and told<S>5608</S> him all things that befell<S>4672</S> them:
And they said<S>559</S> unto Joshua<S>3091</S>, Truly<S>3588</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> into our hands<S>3027</S> all the land<S>776</S>; for even all the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the country<S>776</S> do faint<S>4127</S> because<S>6440</S> of us. <sup>faint: Heb. melt</sup>

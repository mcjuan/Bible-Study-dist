And it came to pass in the ninth<S>8671</S> year<S>8141</S> of his reign<S>4427</S>, in the tenth<S>6224</S> month<S>2320</S>, in the tenth<S>6218</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, that Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> came<S>935</S>, he, and all his host<S>2428</S>, against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> against it; and they built<S>1129</S> forts<S>1785</S> against it round about<S>5439</S>.
And the city<S>5892</S> was besieged<S>935</S> <S>4692</S> unto the eleventh<S>6249</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Zedekiah<S>6667</S>.
And on the ninth<S>8672</S> day of the fourth month<S>2320</S> the famine<S>7458</S> prevailed<S>2388</S> in the city<S>5892</S>, and there was no bread<S>3899</S> for the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
And the city<S>5892</S> was broken up<S>1234</S>, and all the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S> fled by night<S>3915</S> by the way<S>1870</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> between two walls<S>2346</S>, which is by the king's<S>4428</S> garden<S>1588</S>: (now the Chaldees<S>3778</S> were against the city<S>5892</S> round about<S>5439</S>:) and the king went<S>3212</S> the way<S>1870</S> toward the plain<S>6160</S>.
And the army<S>2428</S> of the Chaldees<S>3778</S> pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and overtook<S>5381</S> him in the plains<S>6160</S> of Jericho<S>3405</S>: and all his army<S>2428</S> were scattered<S>6327</S> from him.
So they took<S>8610</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and brought him up<S>5927</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> to Riblah<S>7247</S>; and they gave<S>1696</S> judgment<S>4941</S> upon him. <sup>gave: Heb. spake judgment with him</sup>
And they slew<S>7819</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Zedekiah<S>6667</S> before his eyes<S>5869</S>, and put out<S>5786</S> the eyes<S>5869</S> of Zedekiah<S>6667</S>, and bound<S>631</S> him with fetters<S>5178</S> of brass<S>5178</S>, and carried<S>935</S> him to Babylon<S>894</S>. <sup>put: Heb. made blind</sup>
And in the fifth<S>2549</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the seventh<S>7651</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, which is the nineteenth<S>8672</S> <S>6240</S> <S>8141</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, came<S>935</S> Nebuzaradan<S>5018</S>, captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S>, a servant<S>5650</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: <sup>captain: or, chief marshal</sup>
And he burnt<S>8313</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>, and all the houses<S>1004</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and every great<S>1419</S> man's house<S>1004</S> burnt<S>8313</S> he with fire<S>784</S>.
And all the army<S>2428</S> of the Chaldees<S>3778</S>, that were with the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S>, brake down<S>5422</S> the walls<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> round about<S>5439</S>.
Now the rest<S>3499</S> of the people<S>5971</S> that were left<S>7604</S> in the city<S>5892</S>, and the fugitives<S>5307</S> that fell away<S>5307</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, with the remnant<S>3499</S> of the multitude<S>1995</S>, did Nebuzaradan<S>5018</S> the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> carry away<S>1540</S>. <sup>fugitives: Heb. fallen away</sup>
But the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> left<S>7604</S> of the poor<S>1803</S> of the land<S>776</S> to be vinedressers<S>3755</S> and husbandmen<S>3009</S> <S>1461</S>.
And the pillars<S>5982</S> of brass<S>5178</S> that were in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the bases<S>4350</S>, and the brasen<S>5178</S> sea<S>3220</S> that was in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, did the Chaldees<S>3778</S> break in pieces<S>7665</S>, and carried<S>5375</S> the brass<S>5178</S> of them to Babylon<S>894</S>.
And the pots<S>5518</S>, and the shovels<S>3257</S>, and the snuffers<S>4212</S>, and the spoons<S>3709</S>, and all the vessels<S>3627</S> of brass<S>5178</S> wherewith they ministered<S>8334</S>, took they away<S>3947</S>.
And the firepans<S>4289</S>, and the bowls<S>4219</S>, and such things as were of gold<S>2091</S>, in gold<S>2091</S>, and of silver<S>3701</S>, in silver<S>3701</S>, the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> took away<S>3947</S>.
The two<S>8147</S> pillars<S>5982</S>, one<S>259</S> sea<S>3220</S>, and the bases<S>4350</S> which Solomon<S>8010</S> had made<S>6213</S> for the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; the brass<S>5178</S> of all these vessels<S>3627</S> was without<S>3808</S> weight<S>4948</S>. <sup>one: Heb. the one sea</sup>
The height<S>6967</S> of the one<S>259</S> pillar<S>5982</S> was eighteen<S>8083</S> <S>6240</S> cubits<S>520</S>, and the chapiter<S>3805</S> upon it was brass<S>5178</S>: and the height<S>6967</S> of the chapiter<S>3805</S> three<S>7969</S> cubits<S>520</S>; and the wreathen work<S>7639</S>, and pomegranates<S>7416</S> upon the chapiter<S>3805</S> round about<S>5439</S>, all of brass<S>5178</S>: and like unto these had the second<S>8145</S> pillar<S>5982</S> with wreathen work<S>7639</S>.
And the captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> took<S>3947</S> Seraiah<S>8304</S> the chief<S>7218</S> priest<S>3548</S>, and Zephaniah<S>6846</S> the second<S>4932</S> priest<S>3548</S>, and the three<S>7969</S> keepers<S>8104</S> of the door<S>5592</S>: <sup>door: Heb. threshold</sup>
And out of the city<S>5892</S> he took<S>3947</S> an<S>259</S> officer<S>5631</S> that was set<S>6496</S> over the men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and five<S>2568</S> men<S>582</S> of them that were<S>7200</S> in the king's<S>4428</S> presence<S>6440</S>, which were found<S>4672</S> in the city<S>5892</S>, and the principal<S>8269</S> scribe<S>5608</S> of the host<S>6635</S>, which mustered<S>6633</S> the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S>, and threescore<S>8346</S> men<S>376</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S> that were found<S>4672</S> in the city<S>5892</S>: <sup>officer: or, eunuch</sup> <sup>were in: Heb. saw the king's face</sup> <sup>principal: or, scribe of the captain of the host</sup>
And Nebuzaradan<S>5018</S> captain<S>7227</S> of the guard<S>2876</S> took<S>3947</S> these, and brought<S>3212</S> them to the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> to Riblah<S>7247</S>:
And the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> smote<S>5221</S> them, and slew<S>4191</S> them at Riblah<S>7247</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Hamath<S>2574</S>. So Judah<S>3063</S> was carried away<S>1540</S> out of their land<S>127</S>.
And as for the people<S>5971</S> that remained<S>7604</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, whom Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had left<S>7604</S>, even over them he made Gedaliah<S>1436</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahikam<S>296</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Shaphan<S>8227</S>, ruler<S>6485</S>.
And when all the captains<S>8269</S> of the armies<S>2428</S>, they and their men<S>582</S>, heard<S>8085</S> that the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> had made Gedaliah<S>1436</S> governor<S>6485</S>, there came<S>935</S> to Gedaliah<S>1436</S> to Mizpah<S>4709</S>, even Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, and Johanan<S>3110</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Careah<S>7143</S>, and Seraiah<S>8304</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Tanhumeth<S>8576</S> the Netophathite<S>5200</S>, and Jaazaniah<S>2970</S> the son<S>1121</S> of a Maachathite<S>4602</S>, they and their men<S>582</S>.
And Gedaliah<S>1436</S> sware<S>7650</S> to them, and to their men<S>582</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto them, Fear<S>3372</S> not to be the servants<S>5650</S> of the Chaldees<S>3778</S>: dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S>, and serve<S>5647</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>; and it shall be well<S>3190</S> with you.
But it came to pass in the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S>, that Ishmael<S>3458</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Nethaniah<S>5418</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Elishama<S>476</S>, of the seed<S>2233</S> royal<S>4410</S>, came<S>935</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> men<S>582</S> with him, and smote<S>5221</S> Gedaliah<S>1436</S>, that he died<S>4191</S>, and the Jews<S>3064</S> and the Chaldees<S>3778</S> that were with him at Mizpah<S>4709</S>. <sup>royal: Heb. of the kingdom</sup>
And all the people<S>5971</S>, both small<S>6996</S> and great<S>1419</S>, and the captains<S>8269</S> of the armies<S>2428</S>, arose<S>6965</S>, and came<S>935</S> to Egypt<S>4714</S>: for they were afraid<S>3372</S> of<S>6440</S> the Chaldees<S>3778</S>.
And it came to pass in the seven<S>7651</S> and thirtieth<S>7970</S> year<S>8141</S> of the captivity<S>1546</S> of Jehoiachin<S>3078</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, in the twelfth<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> month<S>2320</S>, on the seven<S>7651</S> and twentieth<S>6242</S> day of the month<S>2320</S>, that Evilmerodach<S>192</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> in the year<S>8141</S> that he began to reign<S>4427</S> did lift up<S>5375</S> the head<S>7218</S> of Jehoiachin<S>3078</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> out of prison<S>1004</S> <S>3608</S>;
And he spake<S>1696</S> kindly<S>2896</S> to him, and set<S>5414</S> his throne<S>3678</S> above the throne<S>3678</S> of the kings<S>4428</S> that were with him in Babylon<S>894</S>; <sup>kindly: Heb. good things with him</sup>

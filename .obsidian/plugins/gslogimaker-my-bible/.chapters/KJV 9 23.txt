Then they told<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, the Philistines<S>6430</S> fight<S>3898</S> against Keilah<S>7084</S>, and they rob<S>8154</S> the threshingfloors<S>1637</S>.
Therefore David<S>1732</S> enquired<S>7592</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Shall I go<S>3212</S> and smite<S>5221</S> these Philistines<S>6430</S>? And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, Go<S>3212</S>, and smite<S>5221</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and save<S>3467</S> Keilah<S>7084</S>.
And David's<S>1732</S> men<S>582</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Behold, we be afraid<S>3373</S> here in Judah<S>3063</S>: how much more then if we come<S>3212</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S> against the armies<S>4634</S> of the Philistines<S>6430</S>?
Then David<S>1732</S> enquired<S>7592</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> yet again<S>3254</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> answered<S>6030</S> him and said<S>559</S>, Arise<S>6965</S>, go down<S>3381</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>; for I will deliver<S>5414</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S> into thine hand<S>3027</S>.
So David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> went<S>3212</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>, and fought<S>3898</S> with the Philistines<S>6430</S>, and brought away<S>5090</S> their cattle<S>4735</S>, and smote<S>5221</S> them with a great<S>1419</S> slaughter<S>4347</S>. So David<S>1732</S> saved<S>3467</S> the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of Keilah<S>7084</S>.
And it came to pass, when Abiathar<S>54</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahimelech<S>288</S> fled<S>1272</S> to David<S>1732</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>, that he came down<S>3381</S> with an ephod<S>646</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>.
And it was told<S>5046</S> Saul<S>7586</S> that David<S>1732</S> was come<S>935</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>. And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S>, God<S>430</S> hath delivered<S>5234</S> him into mine hand<S>3027</S>; for he is shut in<S>5462</S>, by entering<S>935</S> into a town<S>5892</S> that hath gates<S>1817</S> and bars<S>1280</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> called<S>8085</S> all the people<S>5971</S> together<S>8085</S> to war<S>4421</S>, to go down<S>3381</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>, to besiege<S>6696</S> David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> knew<S>3045</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> secretly practised<S>2790</S> mischief<S>7451</S> against him; and he said<S>559</S> to Abiathar<S>54</S> the priest<S>3548</S>, Bring hither<S>5066</S> the ephod<S>646</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> David<S>1732</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, thy servant<S>5650</S> hath certainly<S>8085</S> heard<S>8085</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> seeketh<S>1245</S> to come<S>935</S> to Keilah<S>7084</S>, to destroy<S>7843</S> the city<S>5892</S> for my sake.
Will the men<S>1167</S> of Keilah<S>7084</S> deliver me up<S>5462</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>? will Saul<S>7586</S> come down<S>3381</S>, as thy servant<S>5650</S> hath heard<S>8085</S>? O LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, I beseech thee, tell<S>5046</S> thy servant<S>5650</S>. And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S>, He will come down<S>3381</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> David<S>1732</S>, Will the men<S>1167</S> of Keilah<S>7084</S> deliver<S>5462</S> me and my men<S>582</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>? And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S>, They will deliver thee up<S>5462</S>. <sup>deliver: Heb. shut up</sup>
Then David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S>, which were about six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> <S>376</S>, arose<S>6965</S> and departed<S>3318</S> out of Keilah<S>7084</S>, and went<S>1980</S> whithersoever<S>834</S> they could go<S>1980</S>. And it was told<S>5046</S> Saul<S>7586</S> that David<S>1732</S> was escaped<S>4422</S> from Keilah<S>7084</S>; and he forbare<S>2308</S> to go forth<S>3318</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> abode<S>3427</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> in strong holds<S>4679</S>, and remained<S>3427</S> in a mountain<S>2022</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Ziph<S>2128</S>. And Saul<S>7586</S> sought<S>1245</S> him every day<S>3117</S>, but God<S>430</S> delivered<S>5414</S> him not into his hand<S>3027</S>.
And David<S>1732</S> saw<S>7200</S> that Saul<S>7586</S> was come out<S>3318</S> to seek<S>1245</S> his life<S>5315</S>: and David<S>1732</S> was in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Ziph<S>2128</S> in a wood<S>2793</S>.
And Jonathan<S>3083</S> Saul's<S>7586</S> son<S>1121</S> arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to David<S>1732</S> into the wood<S>2793</S>, and strengthened<S>2388</S> his hand<S>3027</S> in God<S>430</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Fear<S>3372</S> not: for the hand<S>3027</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> my father<S>1</S> shall not find<S>4672</S> thee; and thou shalt be king<S>4427</S> over Israel<S>3478</S>, and I shall be next<S>4932</S> unto thee; and that also Saul<S>7586</S> my father<S>1</S> knoweth<S>3045</S>.
And they two<S>8147</S> made<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: and David<S>1732</S> abode<S>3427</S> in the wood<S>2793</S>, and Jonathan<S>3083</S> went<S>1980</S> to his house<S>1004</S>.
Then came up<S>5927</S> the Ziphites<S>2130</S> to Saul<S>7586</S> to Gibeah<S>1390</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Doth not David<S>1732</S> hide<S>5641</S> himself with us in strong holds<S>4679</S> in the wood<S>2793</S>, in the hill<S>1389</S> of Hachilah<S>2444</S>, which is on the south<S>3225</S> of Jeshimon<S>3452</S>? <sup>on: Heb. on the right hand</sup> <sup>Jeshimon: or, the wilderness</sup>
Now therefore, O king<S>4428</S>, come down<S>3381</S> according to all the desire<S>185</S> of thy soul<S>5315</S> to come down<S>3381</S>; and our part shall be to deliver<S>5462</S> him into the king's<S>4428</S> hand<S>3027</S>.
And Saul<S>7586</S> said<S>559</S>, Blessed<S>1288</S> be ye of the LORD<S>3068</S>; for ye have compassion<S>2550</S> on me.
Go<S>3212</S>, I pray you, prepare<S>3559</S> yet, and know<S>3045</S> and see<S>7200</S> his place<S>4725</S> where his haunt<S>7272</S> is, and who hath seen<S>7200</S> him there: for it is told<S>559</S> me that he dealeth very<S>6191</S> subtilly<S>6191</S>. <sup>haunt: Heb. foot shall be</sup>
See<S>7200</S> therefore, and take knowledge<S>3045</S> of all the lurking places<S>4224</S> where he hideth<S>2244</S> himself, and come ye again<S>7725</S> to me with the certainty<S>3559</S>, and I will go<S>1980</S> with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be<S>3426</S> in the land<S>776</S>, that I will search<S>2664</S> him out throughout all the thousands<S>505</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>.
And they arose<S>6965</S>, and went<S>3212</S> to Ziph<S>2128</S> before<S>6440</S> Saul<S>7586</S>: but David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> were in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Maon<S>4584</S>, in the plain<S>6160</S> on the south<S>3225</S> of Jeshimon<S>3452</S>.
Saul<S>7586</S> also and his men<S>582</S> went<S>3212</S> to seek<S>1245</S> him. And they told<S>5046</S> David<S>1732</S>: wherefore he came down<S>3381</S> into a rock<S>5553</S>, and abode<S>3427</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Maon<S>4584</S>. And when Saul<S>7586</S> heard<S>8085</S> that, he pursued<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> David<S>1732</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S> of Maon<S>4584</S>. <sup>into: or, from the rock</sup>
And Saul<S>7586</S> went<S>3212</S> on this side<S>6654</S> of the mountain<S>2022</S>, and David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> on that side<S>6654</S> of the mountain<S>2022</S>: and David<S>1732</S> made haste<S>2648</S> to get away<S>3212</S> for fear<S>6440</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>; for Saul<S>7586</S> and his men<S>582</S> compassed<S>5849</S> David<S>1732</S> and his men<S>582</S> round about<S>5849</S> to take<S>8610</S> them.
But there came<S>935</S> a messenger<S>4397</S> unto Saul<S>7586</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Haste<S>4116</S> thee, and come<S>3212</S>; for the Philistines<S>6430</S> have invaded<S>6584</S> the land<S>776</S>. <sup>invaded: Heb. spread themselves upon, etc</sup>
Wherefore Saul<S>7586</S> returned<S>7725</S> from pursuing<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> David<S>1732</S>, and went<S>3212</S> against<S>7125</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>: therefore they called<S>7121</S> that place<S>4725</S> Selahammahlekoth<S>5555</S>. <sup>Selahammahlekoth: that is, The rock of divisions</sup>
And David<S>1732</S> went up<S>5927</S> from thence, and dwelt<S>3427</S> in strong holds<S>4679</S> at Engedi<S>5872</S>.

Hear<S>8085</S>, O Israel<S>3478</S>: Thou art to pass over<S>5674</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> this day<S>3117</S>, to go in<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> nations<S>1471</S> greater<S>1419</S> and mightier<S>6099</S> than thyself, cities<S>5892</S> great<S>1419</S> and fenced up<S>1219</S> to heaven<S>8064</S>,
A people<S>5971</S> great<S>1419</S> and tall<S>7311</S>, the children<S>1121</S> of the Anakims<S>6062</S>, whom thou knowest<S>3045</S>, and of whom thou hast heard<S>8085</S> say, Who can stand<S>3320</S> before<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Anak<S>6061</S>!
Understand<S>3045</S> therefore this day<S>3117</S>, that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> is he which goeth over<S>5674</S> before<S>6440</S> thee; as a consuming<S>398</S> fire<S>784</S> he shall destroy<S>8045</S> them, and he shall bring them down<S>3665</S> before thy face<S>6440</S>: so shalt thou drive them out<S>3423</S>, and destroy<S>6</S> them quickly<S>4118</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>1696</S> unto thee.
Speak<S>559</S> not thou in thine heart<S>3824</S>, after that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath cast them out<S>1920</S> from before<S>6440</S> thee, saying<S>559</S>, For my righteousness<S>6666</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> hath brought me in<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> this land<S>776</S>: but for the wickedness<S>7564</S> of these nations<S>1471</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> doth drive them out<S>3423</S> from before<S>6440</S> thee.
Not for thy righteousness<S>6666</S>, or for the uprightness<S>3476</S> of thine heart<S>3824</S>, dost thou go<S>935</S> to possess<S>3423</S> their land<S>776</S>: but for the wickedness<S>7564</S> of these nations<S>1471</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> doth drive them out<S>3423</S> from before<S>6440</S> thee, and that he may perform<S>6965</S> the word<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> sware<S>7650</S> unto thy fathers<S>1</S>, Abraham<S>85</S>, Isaac<S>3327</S>, and Jacob<S>3290</S>.
Understand<S>3045</S> therefore, that the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee not this good<S>2896</S> land<S>776</S> to possess<S>3423</S> it for thy righteousness<S>6666</S>; for thou art a stiffnecked<S>6203</S> <S>7186</S> people<S>5971</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S>, and forget<S>7911</S> not, how thou provokedst the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> to wrath<S>7107</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>: from<S>4480</S> the day<S>3117</S> that thou didst depart out<S>3318</S> of the land<S>776</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, until ye came<S>935</S> unto this place<S>4725</S>, ye have been rebellious<S>4784</S> against<S>5973</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Also in Horeb<S>2722</S> ye provoked<S>7107</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> to wrath<S>7107</S>, so that the LORD<S>3068</S> was angry<S>599</S> with you to have destroyed<S>8045</S> you.
When I was gone up<S>5927</S> into the mount<S>2022</S> to receive<S>3947</S> the tables<S>3871</S> of stone<S>68</S>, even the tables<S>3871</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> made<S>3772</S> with you, then I abode<S>3427</S> in the mount<S>2022</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>, I neither did eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>:
And the LORD<S>3068</S> delivered<S>5414</S> unto me two<S>8147</S> tables<S>3871</S> of stone<S>68</S> written<S>3789</S> with the finger<S>676</S> of God<S>430</S>; and on them was written according to all the words<S>1697</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>1696</S> with you in the mount<S>2022</S> out of the midst<S>8432</S> of the fire<S>784</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of the assembly<S>6951</S>.
And it came to pass at the end<S>7093</S> of forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>, that the LORD<S>3068</S> gave<S>5414</S> me the two<S>8147</S> tables<S>3871</S> of stone<S>68</S>, even the tables<S>3871</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto me, Arise<S>6965</S>, get thee down<S>3381</S> quickly<S>4118</S> from hence; for thy people<S>5971</S> which thou hast brought forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S> have corrupted<S>7843</S> themselves; they are quickly<S>4118</S> turned aside<S>5493</S> out of the way<S>1870</S> which I commanded<S>6680</S> them; they have made<S>6213</S> them a molten image<S>4541</S>.
Furthermore the LORD<S>3068</S> spake<S>559</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>, I have seen<S>7200</S> this people<S>5971</S>, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked<S>6203</S> <S>7186</S> people<S>5971</S>:
Let me alone<S>7503</S>, that I may destroy<S>8045</S> them, and blot out<S>4229</S> their name<S>8034</S> from under heaven<S>8064</S>: and I will make<S>6213</S> of<S>854</S> thee a nation<S>1471</S> mightier<S>6099</S> and greater<S>7227</S> than they.
So I turned<S>6437</S> and came down<S>3381</S> from the mount<S>2022</S>, and the mount<S>2022</S> burned<S>1197</S> with fire<S>784</S>: and the two<S>8147</S> tables<S>3871</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S> were in my two<S>8147</S> hands<S>3027</S>.
And I looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, ye had sinned<S>2398</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, and had made<S>6213</S> you a molten<S>4541</S> calf<S>5695</S>: ye had turned aside<S>5493</S> quickly<S>4118</S> out of the way<S>1870</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> had commanded<S>6680</S> you.
And I took<S>8610</S> the two<S>8147</S> tables<S>3871</S>, and cast<S>7993</S> them out of<S>5921</S> my two<S>8147</S> hands<S>3027</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> them before your eyes<S>5869</S>.
And I fell down<S>5307</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, as at the first<S>7223</S>, forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>: I did neither eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S>, nor drink<S>8354</S> water<S>4325</S>, because of all your sins<S>2403</S> which ye sinned<S>2398</S>, in doing<S>6213</S> wickedly<S>7451</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to provoke him to anger<S>3707</S>.
For I was afraid<S>3025</S> of<S>6440</S> the anger<S>639</S> and hot displeasure<S>2534</S>, wherewith the LORD<S>3068</S> was wroth<S>7107</S> against you to destroy<S>8045</S> you. But the LORD<S>3068</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> unto me at that time<S>6471</S> also.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was very<S>3966</S> angry<S>599</S> with Aaron<S>175</S> to have destroyed<S>8045</S> him: and I prayed<S>6419</S> for Aaron<S>175</S> also the same time<S>6256</S>.
And I took<S>3947</S> your sin<S>2403</S>, the calf<S>5695</S> which ye had made<S>6213</S>, and burnt<S>8313</S> it with fire<S>784</S>, and stamped<S>3807</S> it, and ground<S>2912</S> it very small<S>3190</S>, even until it was as small<S>1854</S> as dust<S>6083</S>: and I cast<S>7993</S> the dust<S>6083</S> thereof into the brook<S>5158</S> that descended out<S>3381</S> of the mount<S>2022</S>.
And at Taberah<S>8404</S>, and at Massah<S>4532</S>, and at Kibrothhattaavah<S>6914</S>, ye provoked the LORD<S>3068</S> to wrath<S>7107</S>.
Likewise when the LORD<S>3068</S> sent<S>7971</S> you from Kadeshbarnea<S>6947</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Go up<S>5927</S> and possess<S>3423</S> the land<S>776</S> which I have given<S>5414</S> you; then ye rebelled<S>4784</S> against the commandment<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>, and ye believed<S>539</S> him not, nor hearkened<S>8085</S> to his voice<S>6963</S>.
Ye have been rebellious<S>4784</S> against the LORD<S>3068</S> from the day<S>3117</S> that I knew<S>3045</S> you.
Thus I fell down<S>5307</S> before<S>6440</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>, as I fell down<S>5307</S> at the first; because the LORD<S>3068</S> had said<S>559</S> he would destroy<S>8045</S> you.
I prayed<S>6419</S> therefore unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, and said<S>559</S>, O Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, destroy<S>7843</S> not thy people<S>5971</S> and thine inheritance<S>5159</S>, which thou hast redeemed<S>6299</S> through thy greatness<S>1433</S>, which thou hast brought forth<S>3318</S> out of Egypt<S>4714</S> with a mighty<S>2389</S> hand<S>3027</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S> thy servants<S>5650</S>, Abraham<S>85</S>, Isaac<S>3327</S>, and Jacob<S>3290</S>; look<S>6437</S> not unto the stubbornness<S>7190</S> of this people<S>5971</S>, nor to their wickedness<S>7562</S>, nor to their sin<S>2403</S>:
Lest the land<S>776</S> whence thou broughtest us out<S>3318</S> say<S>559</S>, Because the LORD<S>3068</S> was not able<S>3201</S> to bring<S>935</S> them into the land<S>776</S> which he promised<S>1696</S> them, and because he hated<S>8135</S> them, he hath brought them out<S>3318</S> to slay<S>4191</S> them in the wilderness<S>4057</S>.
Yet they are thy people<S>5971</S> and thine inheritance<S>5159</S>, which thou broughtest out<S>3318</S> by thy mighty<S>1419</S> power<S>3581</S> and by thy stretched out<S>5186</S> arm<S>2220</S>.

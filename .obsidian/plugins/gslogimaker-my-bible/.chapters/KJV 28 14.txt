O Israel<S>3478</S>, return<S>7725</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S>; for thou hast fallen<S>3782</S> by thine iniquity<S>5771</S>.
Take<S>3947</S> with you words<S>1697</S>, and turn<S>7725</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>: say<S>559</S> unto him, Take away<S>5375</S> all iniquity<S>5771</S>, and receive<S>3947</S> us graciously<S>2896</S>: so will we render<S>7999</S> the calves<S>6499</S> of our lips<S>8193</S>. <sup>receive: or, give good</sup>
Asshur<S>804</S> shall not save<S>3467</S> us; we will not ride<S>7392</S> upon horses<S>5483</S>: neither will we say<S>559</S> any more to the work<S>4639</S> of our hands<S>3027</S>, Ye are our gods<S>430</S>: for in thee the fatherless<S>3490</S> findeth mercy<S>7355</S>.
I will heal<S>7495</S> their backsliding<S>4878</S>, I will love<S>157</S> them freely<S>5071</S>: for mine anger<S>639</S> is turned away<S>7725</S> from him.
I will be as the dew<S>2919</S> unto Israel<S>3478</S>: he shall grow<S>6524</S> as the lily<S>7799</S>, and cast forth<S>5221</S> his roots<S>8328</S> as Lebanon<S>3844</S>. <sup>grow: or, blossom</sup> <sup>cast: Heb. strike</sup>
His branches<S>3127</S> shall spread<S>3212</S>, and his beauty<S>1935</S> shall be as the olive tree<S>2132</S>, and his smell<S>7381</S> as Lebanon<S>3844</S>. <sup>spread: Heb. go</sup>
They that dwell<S>3427</S> under his shadow<S>6738</S> shall return<S>7725</S>; they shall revive<S>2421</S> as the corn<S>1715</S>, and grow<S>6524</S> as the vine<S>1612</S>: the scent<S>2143</S> thereof shall be as the wine<S>3196</S> of Lebanon<S>3844</S>. <sup>grow: or, blossom</sup> <sup>scent: or, memorial</sup>
Ephraim<S>669</S> shall say, What have I to do any more with idols<S>6091</S>? I have heard<S>6030</S> him, and observed<S>7789</S> him: I am like a green<S>7488</S> fir tree<S>1265</S>. From me is thy fruit<S>6529</S> found<S>4672</S>.
Who is wise<S>2450</S>, and he shall understand<S>995</S> these things? prudent<S>995</S>, and he shall know<S>3045</S> them? for the ways<S>1870</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> are right<S>3477</S>, and the just<S>6662</S> shall walk<S>3212</S> in them: but the transgressors<S>6586</S> shall fall<S>3782</S> therein.

Hezekiah<S>3169</S> began to reign<S>4427</S> when he was five<S>2568</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S>, and he reigned<S>4427</S> nine<S>8672</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And his mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> was Abijah<S>29</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Zechariah<S>2148</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, according to all that David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S> had done<S>6213</S>.
He in the first<S>7223</S> year<S>8141</S> of his reign<S>4427</S>, in the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S>, opened<S>6605</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and repaired<S>2388</S> them.
And he brought in<S>935</S> the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>, and gathered them together<S>622</S> into the east<S>4217</S> street<S>7339</S>,
And said<S>559</S> unto them, Hear<S>8085</S> me, ye Levites<S>3881</S>, sanctify<S>6942</S> now yourselves, and sanctify<S>6942</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of your fathers<S>1</S>, and carry forth<S>3318</S> the filthiness<S>5079</S> out of the holy<S>6944</S> place.
For our fathers<S>1</S> have trespassed<S>4603</S>, and done<S>6213</S> that which was evil<S>7451</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>, and have forsaken<S>5800</S> him, and have turned away<S>5437</S> their faces<S>6440</S> from the habitation<S>4908</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and turned<S>5414</S> their backs<S>6203</S>. <sup>turned their: Heb. given the neck</sup>
Also they have shut up<S>5462</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of the porch<S>197</S>, and put out<S>3518</S> the lamps<S>5216</S>, and have not burned<S>6999</S> incense<S>7004</S> nor offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> in the holy<S>6944</S> place unto the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
Wherefore the wrath<S>7110</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was upon Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and he hath delivered<S>5414</S> them to trouble<S>2189</S> <S>2113</S>, to astonishment<S>8047</S>, and to hissing<S>8322</S>, as ye see<S>7200</S> with your eyes<S>5869</S>. <sup>trouble: Heb. commotion</sup>
For, lo, our fathers<S>1</S> have fallen<S>5307</S> by the sword<S>2719</S>, and our sons<S>1121</S> and our daughters<S>1323</S> and our wives<S>802</S> are in captivity<S>7628</S> for this.
Now it is in mine heart<S>3824</S> to make<S>3772</S> a covenant<S>1285</S> with the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that his fierce<S>2740</S> wrath<S>639</S> may turn away<S>7725</S> from us.
My sons<S>1121</S>, be not now negligent<S>7952</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath chosen<S>977</S> you to stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him, to serve<S>8334</S> him, and that ye should minister<S>8334</S> unto him, and burn incense<S>6999</S>. <sup>be not: or, be not now deceived</sup> <sup>burn: or, offer sacrifice</sup>
Then the Levites<S>3881</S> arose<S>6965</S>, Mahath<S>4287</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Amasai<S>6022</S>, and Joel<S>3100</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Azariah<S>5838</S>, of the sons<S>1121</S> of the Kohathites<S>6956</S>: and of the sons<S>1121</S> of Merari<S>4847</S>, Kish<S>7027</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Abdi<S>5660</S>, and Azariah<S>5838</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Jehalelel<S>3094</S>: and of the Gershonites<S>1649</S>; Joah<S>3098</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zimmah<S>2155</S>, and Eden<S>5731</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Joah<S>3098</S>:
And of the sons<S>1121</S> of Elizaphan<S>469</S>; Shimri<S>8113</S>, and Jeiel<S>3273</S>: and of the sons<S>1121</S> of Asaph<S>623</S>; Zechariah<S>2148</S>, and Mattaniah<S>4983</S>:
And of the sons<S>1121</S> of Heman<S>1968</S>; Jehiel<S>3171</S>, and Shimei<S>8096</S>: and of the sons<S>1121</S> of Jeduthun<S>3038</S>; Shemaiah<S>8098</S>, and Uzziel<S>5816</S>.
And they gathered<S>622</S> their brethren<S>251</S>, and sanctified<S>6942</S> themselves, and came<S>935</S>, according to the commandment<S>4687</S> of the king<S>4428</S>, by the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to cleanse<S>2891</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>by the words: or, in the business of the LORD</sup>
And the priests<S>3548</S> went<S>935</S> into the inner part<S>6441</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, to cleanse<S>2891</S> it, and brought out<S>3318</S> all the uncleanness<S>2932</S> that they found<S>4672</S> in the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> into the court<S>2691</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. And the Levites<S>3881</S> took<S>6901</S> it, to carry it out<S>3318</S> abroad<S>2351</S> into the brook<S>5158</S> Kidron<S>6939</S>.
Now they began<S>2490</S> on the first<S>259</S> day of the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S> to sanctify<S>6942</S>, and on the eighth<S>8083</S> day<S>3117</S> of the month<S>2320</S> came<S>935</S> they to the porch<S>197</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: so they sanctified<S>6942</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> in eight<S>8083</S> days<S>3117</S>; and in the sixteenth<S>8337</S> <S>6240</S> day of the first<S>7223</S> month<S>2320</S> they made an end<S>3615</S>.
Then they went<S>935</S> in<S>6441</S> to Hezekiah<S>2396</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and said<S>559</S>, We have cleansed<S>2891</S> all the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and the altar<S>4196</S> of burnt offering<S>5930</S>, with all the vessels<S>3627</S> thereof, and the shewbread<S>4635</S> table<S>7979</S>, with all the vessels<S>3627</S> thereof.
Moreover all the vessels<S>3627</S>, which king<S>4428</S> Ahaz<S>271</S> in his reign<S>4438</S> did cast away<S>2186</S> in his transgression<S>4604</S>, have we prepared<S>3559</S> and sanctified<S>6942</S>, and, behold, they are before<S>6440</S> the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Then Hezekiah<S>3169</S> the king<S>4428</S> rose early<S>7925</S>, and gathered<S>622</S> the rulers<S>8269</S> of the city<S>5892</S>, and went up<S>5927</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And they brought<S>935</S> seven<S>7651</S> bullocks<S>6499</S>, and seven<S>7651</S> rams<S>352</S>, and seven<S>7651</S> lambs<S>3532</S>, and seven<S>7651</S> he<S>6842</S> goats<S>5795</S>, for a sin offering<S>2403</S> for the kingdom<S>4467</S>, and for the sanctuary<S>4720</S>, and for Judah<S>3063</S>. And he commanded<S>559</S> the priests<S>3548</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Aaron<S>175</S> to offer<S>5927</S> them on the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
So they killed<S>7819</S> the bullocks<S>1241</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> received<S>6901</S> the blood<S>1818</S>, and sprinkled<S>2236</S> it on the altar<S>4196</S>: likewise, when they had killed<S>7819</S> the rams<S>352</S>, they sprinkled<S>2236</S> the blood<S>1818</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>: they killed<S>7819</S> also the lambs<S>3532</S>, and they sprinkled<S>2236</S> the blood<S>1818</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>.
And they brought forth<S>5066</S> the he goats<S>8163</S> for the sin offering<S>2403</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S> and the congregation<S>6951</S>; and they laid<S>5564</S> their hands<S>3027</S> upon them: <sup>forth: Heb. near</sup>
And the priests<S>3548</S> killed<S>7819</S> them, and they made reconciliation<S>2398</S> with their blood<S>1818</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>, to make an atonement<S>3722</S> for all Israel<S>3478</S>: for the king<S>4428</S> commanded<S>559</S> that the burnt offering<S>5930</S> and the sin offering<S>2403</S> should be made for all Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he set<S>5975</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> with cymbals<S>4700</S>, with psalteries<S>5035</S>, and with harps<S>3658</S>, according to the commandment<S>4687</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and of Gad<S>1410</S> the king's<S>4428</S> seer<S>2374</S>, and Nathan<S>5416</S> the prophet<S>5030</S>: for so was the commandment<S>4687</S> of<S>3027</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> by<S>3027</S> his prophets<S>5030</S>. <sup>commandment of the LORD: Heb. commandment by the hand of the LORD</sup> <sup>by: Heb. by the hand of</sup>
And the Levites<S>3881</S> stood<S>5975</S> with the instruments<S>3627</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and the priests<S>3548</S> with the trumpets<S>2689</S>.
And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> commanded<S>559</S> to offer<S>5927</S> the burnt offering<S>5930</S> upon the altar<S>4196</S>. And when<S>6256</S> the burnt offering<S>5930</S> began<S>2490</S>, the song<S>7892</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> began<S>2490</S> also with the trumpets<S>2689</S>, and with the instruments<S>3627</S> ordained by<S>3027</S> David<S>1732</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. <sup>when: Heb. in the time</sup> <sup>the instruments: Heb. hands of instruments</sup>
And all the congregation<S>6951</S> worshipped<S>7812</S>, and the singers<S>7892</S> sang<S>7891</S>, and the trumpeters<S>2689</S> sounded<S>2690</S> <S>2690</S>: and all this continued until the burnt offering<S>5930</S> was finished<S>3615</S>. <sup>singers: Heb. song</sup>
And when they had made an end<S>3615</S> of offering<S>5927</S>, the king<S>4428</S> and all that were present<S>4672</S> with him bowed<S>3766</S> themselves, and worshipped<S>7812</S>. <sup>present: Heb. found</sup>
Moreover Hezekiah<S>3169</S> the king<S>4428</S> and the princes<S>8269</S> commanded<S>559</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> to sing praise<S>1984</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> with the words<S>1697</S> of David<S>1732</S>, and of Asaph<S>623</S> the seer<S>2374</S>. And they sang praises<S>1984</S> with gladness<S>8057</S>, and they bowed their heads<S>6915</S> and worshipped<S>7812</S>.
Then Hezekiah<S>3169</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>, Now ye have consecrated<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> yourselves unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, come near<S>5066</S> and bring<S>935</S> sacrifices<S>2077</S> and thank offerings<S>8426</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. And the congregation<S>6951</S> brought in<S>935</S> sacrifices<S>2077</S> and thank offerings<S>8426</S>; and as many as were of a free<S>5081</S> heart<S>3820</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S>. <sup>consecrated: or, filled your hand</sup>
And the number<S>4557</S> of the burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, which the congregation<S>6951</S> brought<S>935</S>, was threescore and ten<S>7657</S> bullocks<S>1241</S>, an hundred<S>3967</S> rams<S>352</S>, and two hundred<S>3967</S> lambs<S>3532</S>: all these were for a burnt offering<S>5930</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And the consecrated things<S>6944</S> were six<S>8337</S> hundred<S>3967</S> oxen<S>1241</S> and three<S>7969</S> thousand<S>505</S> sheep<S>6629</S>.
But the priests<S>3548</S> were too few<S>4592</S>, so that they could<S>3201</S> not flay<S>6584</S> all the burnt offerings<S>5930</S>: wherefore their brethren<S>251</S> the Levites<S>3881</S> did help<S>2388</S> them, till the work<S>4399</S> was ended<S>3615</S>, and until the other priests<S>3548</S> had sanctified<S>6942</S> themselves: for the Levites<S>3881</S> were more upright<S>3477</S> in heart<S>3824</S> to sanctify<S>6942</S> themselves than the priests<S>3548</S>. <sup>did help: Heb. strengthened them</sup>
And also the burnt offerings<S>5930</S> were in abundance<S>7230</S>, with the fat<S>2459</S> of the peace offerings<S>8002</S>, and the drink offerings<S>5262</S> for every burnt offering<S>5930</S>. So the service<S>5656</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was set in order<S>3559</S>.
And Hezekiah<S>3169</S> rejoiced<S>8055</S>, and all the people<S>5971</S>, that God<S>430</S> had prepared<S>3559</S> the people<S>5971</S>: for the thing<S>1697</S> was done suddenly<S>6597</S>.

Then Job<S>347</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S>,
I know<S>3045</S> it is so of a truth<S>551</S>: but how should man<S>582</S> be just<S>6663</S> with God<S>410</S>? <sup>with God: or, before God?</sup>
If he will<S>2654</S> contend<S>7378</S> with him, he cannot answer<S>6030</S> him one<S>259</S> of a thousand<S>505</S>.
He is wise<S>2450</S> in heart<S>3824</S>, and mighty<S>533</S> in strength<S>3581</S>: who hath hardened<S>7185</S> himself against him, and hath prospered<S>7999</S>?
Which removeth<S>6275</S> the mountains<S>2022</S>, and they know<S>3045</S> not: which overturneth<S>2015</S> them in his anger<S>639</S>.
Which shaketh<S>7264</S> the earth<S>776</S> out of her place<S>4725</S>, and the pillars<S>5982</S> thereof tremble<S>6426</S>.
Which commandeth<S>559</S> the sun<S>2775</S>, and it riseth<S>2224</S> not; and sealeth up<S>2856</S> the stars<S>3556</S>.
Which alone spreadeth out<S>5186</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>, and treadeth<S>1869</S> upon the waves<S>1116</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>. <sup>waves: Heb. heights</sup>
Which maketh<S>6213</S> Arcturus<S>5906</S>, Orion<S>3685</S>, and Pleiades<S>3598</S>, and the chambers<S>2315</S> of the south<S>8486</S>. <sup>Arcturus: Heb. Ash, Cesil, and Cimah</sup>
Which doeth<S>6213</S> great things<S>1419</S> past<S>369</S> finding out<S>2714</S>; yea, and wonders<S>6381</S> without number<S>4557</S>.
Lo, he goeth<S>5674</S> by me, and I see<S>7200</S> him not: he passeth on<S>2498</S> also, but I perceive<S>995</S> him not.
Behold, he taketh away<S>2862</S>, who can hinder<S>7725</S> him? who will say<S>559</S> unto him, What doest<S>6213</S> thou? <sup>hinder: Heb. turn him away?</sup>
If God<S>433</S> will not withdraw<S>7725</S> his anger<S>639</S>, the proud<S>7293</S> helpers<S>5826</S> do stoop<S>7817</S> under him. <sup>proud: Heb. helpers of pride, or, strength</sup>
How much less shall I answer<S>6030</S> him, and choose out<S>977</S> my words<S>1697</S> to reason with him?
Whom, though I were righteous<S>6663</S>, yet would I not answer<S>6030</S>, but I would make supplication<S>2603</S> to my judge<S>8199</S>.
If I had called<S>7121</S>, and he had answered<S>6030</S> me; yet would I not believe<S>539</S> that he had hearkened<S>238</S> unto my voice<S>6963</S>.
For he breaketh<S>7779</S> me with a tempest<S>8183</S>, and multiplieth<S>7235</S> my wounds<S>6482</S> without cause<S>2600</S>.
He will not suffer<S>5414</S> me to take<S>7725</S> my breath<S>7307</S>, but filleth<S>7646</S> me with bitterness<S>4472</S>.
If I speak of strength<S>3581</S>, lo, he is strong<S>533</S>: and if of judgment<S>4941</S>, who shall set<S>3259</S> me a time to plead?
If I justify<S>6663</S> myself, mine own mouth<S>6310</S> shall condemn<S>7561</S> me: if I say, I am perfect<S>8535</S>, it shall also prove me perverse<S>6140</S>.
Though I were perfect<S>8535</S>, yet would I not know<S>3045</S> my soul<S>5315</S>: I would despise<S>3988</S> my life<S>2416</S>.
This is one<S>259</S> thing, therefore I said<S>559</S> it, He destroyeth<S>3615</S> the perfect<S>8535</S> and the wicked<S>7563</S>.
If the scourge<S>7752</S> slay<S>4191</S> suddenly<S>6597</S>, he will laugh<S>3932</S> at the trial<S>4531</S> of the innocent<S>5355</S>.
The earth<S>776</S> is given<S>5414</S> into the hand<S>3027</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S>: he covereth<S>3680</S> the faces<S>6440</S> of the judges<S>8199</S> thereof; if not, where<S>645</S>, and who is he?
Now my days<S>3117</S> are swifter<S>7043</S> than a post<S>7323</S>: they flee away<S>1272</S>, they see<S>7200</S> no good<S>2896</S>.
They are passed away<S>2498</S> as<S>5973</S> the swift<S>16</S> ships<S>591</S>: as the eagle<S>5404</S> that hasteth<S>2907</S> to the prey<S>400</S>. <sup>swift: or, ships of Ebeh: Heb. ships of desire</sup>
If I say<S>559</S>, I will forget<S>7911</S> my complaint<S>7879</S>, I will leave off<S>5800</S> my heaviness<S>6440</S>, and comfort<S>1082</S> myself:
I am afraid<S>3025</S> of all my sorrows<S>6094</S>, I know<S>3045</S> that thou wilt not hold me innocent<S>5352</S>.
If I be wicked<S>7561</S>, why then labour<S>3021</S> I in vain<S>1892</S>?
If I wash<S>7364</S> myself with<S>7950</S> snow water<S>4325</S> <S>1119</S>, and make my hands<S>3709</S> never<S>1252</S> <S>1253</S> so clean<S>2141</S>;
Yet<S>227</S> shalt thou plunge<S>2881</S> me in the ditch<S>7845</S>, and mine own clothes<S>8008</S> shall abhor<S>8581</S> me. <sup>abhor: or, make me to be abhorred</sup>
For he is not a man<S>376</S>, as I am, that I should answer<S>6030</S> him, and we should come<S>935</S> together<S>3162</S> in judgment<S>4941</S>.
Neither is<S>3426</S> there any daysman<S>3198</S> betwixt us, that might lay<S>7896</S> his hand<S>3027</S> upon us both<S>8147</S>. <sup>any: Heb. one that should argue</sup> <sup>daysman: or, umpire</sup>
Let him take<S>5493</S> his rod<S>7626</S> away<S>5493</S> from me, and let not his fear<S>367</S> terrify<S>1204</S> me:
Then would I speak<S>1696</S>, and not fear<S>3372</S> him; but it is not so with me. <sup>it is: Heb. I am not so with myself</sup>

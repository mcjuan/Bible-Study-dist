The vision<S>2377</S> of Obadiah<S>5662</S>. Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> concerning Edom<S>123</S>; We have heard<S>8085</S> a rumour<S>8052</S> from the LORD<S>3068</S>, and an ambassador<S>6735</S> is sent<S>7971</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>, Arise<S>6965</S> ye, and let us rise up<S>6965</S> against her in battle<S>4421</S>.
Behold, I have made<S>5414</S> thee small<S>6996</S> among the heathen<S>1471</S>: thou art greatly<S>3966</S> despised<S>959</S>.
The pride<S>2087</S> of thine heart<S>3820</S> hath deceived<S>5377</S> thee, thou that dwellest<S>7931</S> in the clefts<S>2288</S> of the rock<S>5553</S>, whose habitation<S>3427</S> is high<S>4791</S>; that saith<S>559</S> in his heart<S>3820</S>, Who shall bring me down<S>3381</S> to the ground<S>776</S>?
Though thou exalt<S>1361</S> thyself as the eagle<S>5404</S>, and though thou set<S>7760</S> thy nest<S>7064</S> among the stars<S>3556</S>, thence will I bring thee down<S>3381</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.
If thieves<S>1590</S> came<S>935</S> to thee, if robbers<S>7703</S> by night<S>3915</S>, (how art thou cut off<S>1820</S>!) would they not have stolen<S>1589</S> till they had enough<S>1767</S>? if the grapegatherers<S>1219</S> came<S>935</S> to thee, would they not leave<S>7604</S> some grapes<S>5955</S>? <sup>some: or, gleanings?</sup>
How are the things of Esau<S>6215</S> searched out<S>2664</S>! how are his hidden<S>4710</S> things sought up<S>1158</S>!
All the men<S>582</S> of thy confederacy<S>1285</S> have brought<S>7971</S> thee even to the border<S>1366</S>: the men<S>582</S> that were at peace<S>7965</S> with thee have deceived<S>5377</S> thee, and prevailed<S>3201</S> against thee; they that eat thy bread<S>3899</S> have laid<S>7760</S> a wound<S>4204</S> under thee: there is none understanding<S>8394</S> in him. <sup>that were: Heb. of thy peace</sup> <sup>they: Heb. the men of thy bread</sup> <sup>in him: or, of it</sup>
Shall I not in that day<S>3117</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, even destroy<S>6</S> the wise<S>2450</S> men out of Edom<S>123</S>, and understanding<S>8394</S> out of the mount<S>2022</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>?
And thy mighty<S>1368</S> men, O Teman<S>8487</S>, shall be dismayed<S>2865</S>, to the end that every one<S>376</S> of the mount<S>2022</S> of Esau<S>6215</S> may be cut off<S>3772</S> by slaughter<S>6993</S>.
For thy violence<S>2555</S> against thy brother<S>251</S> Jacob<S>3290</S> shame<S>955</S> shall cover<S>3680</S> thee, and thou shalt be cut off<S>3772</S> for ever<S>5769</S>.
In the day<S>3117</S> that thou stoodest<S>5975</S> on the other side, in the day<S>3117</S> that the strangers<S>2114</S> carried away captive<S>7617</S> his forces<S>2428</S>, and foreigners<S>5237</S> entered<S>935</S> into his gates<S>8179</S>, and cast<S>3032</S> lots<S>1486</S> upon Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, even thou wast as one<S>259</S> of them. <sup>captive: or, his substance</sup>
But thou shouldest not have looked<S>7200</S> on the day<S>3117</S> of thy brother<S>251</S> in the day<S>3117</S> that he became a stranger<S>5235</S>; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced<S>8055</S> over the children<S>1121</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of their destruction<S>6</S>; neither shouldest thou have spoken<S>6310</S> proudly<S>1431</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of distress<S>6869</S>. <sup>spoken: Heb. magnified thy mouth</sup>
Thou shouldest not have entered<S>935</S> into the gate<S>8179</S> of my people<S>5971</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of their calamity<S>343</S>; yea, thou shouldest not have looked<S>7200</S> on their affliction<S>7451</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of their calamity<S>343</S>, nor have laid<S>7971</S> hands on their substance<S>2428</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of their calamity<S>343</S>; <sup>substance: or, forces</sup>
Neither shouldest thou have stood<S>5975</S> in the crossway<S>6563</S>, to cut off<S>3772</S> those of his that did escape<S>6412</S>; neither shouldest thou have delivered up<S>5462</S> those of his that did remain<S>8300</S> in the day<S>3117</S> of distress<S>6869</S>. <sup>delivered up: or, shut up</sup>
For the day<S>3117</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> is near<S>7138</S> upon all the heathen<S>1471</S>: as thou hast done<S>6213</S>, it shall be done<S>6213</S> unto thee: thy reward<S>1576</S> shall return<S>7725</S> upon thine own head<S>7218</S>.
For as ye have drunk<S>8354</S> upon my holy<S>6944</S> mountain<S>2022</S>, so shall all the heathen<S>1471</S> drink<S>8354</S> continually<S>8548</S>, yea, they shall drink<S>8354</S>, and they shall swallow down<S>3886</S>, and they shall be as though they had not<S>3808</S> been. <sup>swallow: or, sup up</sup>
But upon mount<S>2022</S> Zion<S>6726</S> shall be deliverance<S>6413</S>, and there shall be holiness<S>6944</S>; and the house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> shall possess<S>3423</S> their possessions<S>4180</S>. <sup>deliverance: or, they that escape</sup> <sup>there: or, it shall be holy</sup>

And they of the south<S>5045</S> shall possess<S>3423</S> the mount<S>2022</S> of Esau<S>6215</S>; and they of the plain<S>8219</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>: and they shall possess<S>3423</S> the fields<S>7704</S> of Ephraim<S>669</S>, and the fields<S>7704</S> of Samaria<S>8111</S>: and Benjamin<S>1144</S> shall possess Gilead<S>1568</S>.
And the captivity<S>1546</S> of this host<S>2426</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> shall possess that of the Canaanites<S>3669</S>, even unto Zarephath<S>6886</S>; and the captivity<S>1546</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, which is in Sepharad<S>5614</S>, shall possess<S>3423</S> the cities<S>5892</S> of the south<S>5045</S>. <sup>which: or, shall possess that which is in</sup>

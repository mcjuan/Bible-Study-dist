And it came to pass at the end<S>7093</S> of twenty<S>6242</S> years<S>8141</S>, wherein Solomon<S>8010</S> had built<S>1129</S> the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and his own house<S>1004</S>,
That the cities<S>5892</S> which Huram<S>2361</S> had restored<S>5414</S> to Solomon<S>8010</S>, Solomon<S>8010</S> built<S>1129</S> them, and caused the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> there.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> went<S>3212</S> to Hamathzobah<S>2578</S>, and prevailed<S>2388</S> against it.
And he built<S>1129</S> Tadmor<S>8412</S> in the wilderness<S>4057</S>, and all the store<S>4543</S> cities<S>5892</S>, which he built<S>1129</S> in Hamath<S>2574</S>.
Also he built<S>1129</S> Bethhoron<S>1032</S> the upper<S>5945</S>, and Bethhoron<S>1032</S> the nether<S>8481</S>, fenced<S>4692</S> cities<S>5892</S>, with walls<S>2346</S>, gates<S>1817</S>, and bars<S>1280</S>;
And Baalath<S>1191</S>, and all the store<S>4543</S> cities<S>5892</S> that Solomon<S>8010</S> had, and all the chariot<S>7393</S> cities<S>5892</S>, and the cities<S>5892</S> of the horsemen<S>6571</S>, and all that Solomon<S>8010</S> desired<S>2836</S> <S>2837</S> to build<S>1129</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and in Lebanon<S>3844</S>, and throughout all the land<S>776</S> of his dominion<S>4475</S>. <sup>all that: Heb. all the desire of Solomon which he desired to build</sup>
As for all the people<S>5971</S> that were left<S>3498</S> of the Hittites<S>2850</S>, and the Amorites<S>567</S>, and the Perizzites<S>6522</S>, and the Hivites<S>2340</S>, and the Jebusites<S>2983</S>, which were not of Israel<S>3478</S>,
But of their children<S>1121</S>, who were left<S>3498</S> after<S>310</S> them in the land<S>776</S>, whom the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> consumed<S>3615</S> not, them did Solomon<S>8010</S> make to pay<S>5927</S> tribute<S>4522</S> until this day<S>3117</S>.
But of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did Solomon<S>8010</S> make<S>5414</S> no servants<S>5650</S> for his work<S>4399</S>; but they were men<S>582</S> of war<S>4421</S>, and chief<S>8269</S> of his captains<S>7991</S>, and captains<S>8269</S> of his chariots<S>7393</S> and horsemen<S>6571</S>.
And these were the chief<S>8269</S> of king<S>4428</S> Solomon's<S>8010</S> officers<S>5324</S> <S>5333</S>, even two hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S>, that bare rule<S>7287</S> over the people<S>5971</S>.
And Solomon<S>8010</S> brought up<S>5927</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Pharaoh<S>6547</S> out of the city<S>5892</S> of David<S>1732</S> unto the house<S>1004</S> that he had built<S>1129</S> for her: for he said<S>559</S>, My wife<S>802</S> shall not dwell<S>3427</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of David<S>1732</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, because the places are holy<S>6944</S>, whereunto the ark<S>727</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> hath come<S>935</S>. <sup>holy: Heb. holiness</sup>
Then Solomon<S>8010</S> offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> on the altar<S>4196</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, which he had built<S>1129</S> before<S>6440</S> the porch<S>197</S>,
Even after a certain rate<S>1697</S> every day<S>3117</S>, offering<S>5927</S> according to the commandment<S>4687</S> of Moses<S>4872</S>, on the sabbaths<S>7676</S>, and on the new moons<S>2320</S>, and on the solemn feasts<S>4150</S>, three<S>7969</S> times<S>6471</S> in the year<S>8141</S>, even in the feast<S>2282</S> of unleavened bread<S>4682</S>, and in the feast<S>2282</S> of weeks<S>7620</S>, and in the feast<S>2282</S> of tabernacles<S>5521</S>.
And he appointed<S>5975</S>, according to the order<S>4941</S> of David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S>, the courses<S>4256</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> to their service<S>5656</S>, and the Levites<S>3881</S> to their charges<S>4931</S>, to praise<S>1984</S> and minister<S>8334</S> before the priests<S>3548</S>, as the duty<S>1697</S> of every day<S>3117</S> required<S>3117</S>: the porters<S>7778</S> also by their courses<S>4256</S> at every gate<S>8179</S>: for so had David<S>1732</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> commanded<S>4687</S>. <sup>so had David: Heb. so was the commandment of David the man of God</sup>
And they departed<S>5493</S> not from the commandment<S>4687</S> of the king<S>4428</S> unto the priests<S>3548</S> and Levites<S>3881</S> concerning any matter<S>1697</S>, or concerning the treasures<S>214</S>.
Now all the work<S>4399</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S> was prepared<S>3559</S> unto the day<S>3117</S> of the foundation<S>4143</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and until it was finished<S>3615</S>. So the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was perfected<S>8003</S>.
Then went<S>1980</S> Solomon<S>8010</S> to Eziongeber<S>6100</S>, and to Eloth<S>359</S>, at the sea<S>3220</S> side<S>8193</S> in the land<S>776</S> of Edom<S>123</S>. <sup>Eloth: also called, Elath, Deut.2.8.</sup>
And Huram<S>2361</S> sent<S>7971</S> him by the hands<S>3027</S> of his servants<S>5650</S> ships<S>591</S> <S>591</S>, and servants<S>5650</S> that had knowledge<S>3045</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>; and they went<S>935</S> with the servants<S>5650</S> of Solomon<S>8010</S> to Ophir<S>211</S>, and took<S>3947</S> thence four<S>702</S> hundred<S>3967</S> and fifty<S>2572</S> talents<S>3603</S> of gold<S>2091</S>, and brought<S>935</S> them to king<S>4428</S> Solomon<S>8010</S>.

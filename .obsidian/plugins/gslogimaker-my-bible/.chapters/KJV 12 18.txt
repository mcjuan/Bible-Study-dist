Now it came to pass in the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of Hoshea<S>1954</S> son<S>1121</S> of Elah<S>425</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that Hezekiah<S>2396</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Ahaz<S>271</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> began to reign<S>4427</S>. <sup>Hezekiah: he is called Ezekias</sup>
Twenty<S>6242</S> and five<S>2568</S> years<S>8141</S> old<S>1121</S> was he when he began to reign<S>4427</S>; and he reigned<S>4427</S> twenty<S>6242</S> and nine<S>8672</S> years<S>8141</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. His mother's<S>517</S> name<S>8034</S> also was Abi<S>21</S>, the daughter<S>1323</S> of Zachariah<S>2148</S>.
And he did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, according to all that David<S>1732</S> his father<S>1</S> did<S>6213</S>.
He removed<S>5493</S> the high places<S>1116</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> the images<S>4676</S>, and cut down<S>3772</S> the groves<S>842</S>, and brake in pieces<S>3807</S> the brasen<S>5178</S> serpent<S>5175</S> that Moses<S>4872</S> had made<S>6213</S>: for unto those days<S>3117</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> did burn incense<S>6999</S> to it: and he called<S>7121</S> it Nehushtan<S>5180</S>. <sup>images: Heb. statues</sup> <sup>Nehushtan: that is, A piece of brass</sup>
He trusted<S>982</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; so that after<S>310</S> him was none like him among all the kings<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, nor any that were before<S>6440</S> him.
For he clave<S>1692</S> to the LORD<S>3068</S>, and departed<S>5493</S> not from following<S>310</S> him, but kept<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S> Moses<S>4872</S>. <sup>from: Heb. from after him</sup>
And the LORD<S>3068</S> was with him; and he prospered<S>7919</S> whithersoever he went forth<S>3318</S>: and he rebelled<S>4775</S> against the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>, and served<S>5647</S> him not.
He smote<S>5221</S> the Philistines<S>6430</S>, even unto Gaza<S>5804</S>, and the borders<S>1366</S> thereof, from the tower<S>4026</S> of the watchmen<S>5341</S> to the fenced<S>4013</S> city<S>5892</S>. <sup>Gaza: Heb. Azzah</sup>
And it came to pass in the fourth<S>7243</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S>, which was the seventh<S>7637</S> year<S>8141</S> of Hoshea<S>1954</S> son<S>1121</S> of Elah<S>425</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, that Shalmaneser<S>8022</S> king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> came up<S>5927</S> against Samaria<S>8111</S>, and besieged<S>6696</S> it.
And at the end<S>7097</S> of three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S> they took<S>3920</S> it: even in the sixth<S>8337</S> year<S>8141</S> of Hezekiah<S>2396</S>, that is the ninth<S>8672</S> year<S>8141</S> of Hoshea<S>1954</S> king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, Samaria<S>8111</S> was taken<S>3920</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> did carry away<S>1540</S> Israel<S>3478</S> unto Assyria<S>804</S>, and put<S>5148</S> them in Halah<S>2477</S> and in Habor<S>2249</S> by the river<S>5104</S> of Gozan<S>1470</S>, and in the cities<S>5892</S> of the Medes<S>4074</S>:
Because they obeyed<S>8085</S> not the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>, but transgressed<S>5674</S> his covenant<S>1285</S>, and all that Moses<S>4872</S> the servant<S>5650</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> commanded<S>6680</S>, and would not hear<S>8085</S> them, nor do<S>6213</S> them.
Now in the fourteenth<S>702</S> <S>6240</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S> did Sennacherib<S>5576</S> king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> come up<S>5927</S> against all the fenced<S>1219</S> cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and took<S>8610</S> them. <sup>Sennacherib: Heb. Sanherib</sup>
And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> sent<S>7971</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> to Lachish<S>3923</S>, saying<S>559</S>, I have offended<S>2398</S>; return<S>7725</S> from me: that which thou puttest<S>5414</S> on me will I bear<S>5375</S>. And the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> appointed<S>7760</S> unto Hezekiah<S>2396</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> three<S>7969</S> hundred<S>3967</S> talents<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S> and thirty<S>7970</S> talents<S>3603</S> of gold<S>2091</S>.
And Hezekiah<S>2396</S> gave<S>5414</S> him all the silver<S>3701</S> that was found<S>4672</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and in the treasures<S>214</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> house<S>1004</S>.
At that time<S>6256</S> did Hezekiah<S>2396</S> cut off<S>7112</S> the gold from the doors<S>1817</S> of the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and from the pillars<S>547</S> which Hezekiah<S>2396</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> had overlaid<S>6823</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> it to the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>. <sup>it: Heb. them</sup>
And the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S> sent<S>7971</S> Tartan<S>8661</S> and Rabsaris<S>7249</S> and Rabshakeh<S>7262</S> from Lachish<S>3923</S> to king<S>4428</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S> with a great<S>3515</S> host<S>2426</S> against Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And they went up<S>5927</S> and came<S>935</S> to Jerusalem<S>3389</S>. And when they were come up<S>5927</S>, they came<S>935</S> and stood<S>5975</S> by the conduit<S>8585</S> of the upper<S>5945</S> pool<S>1295</S>, which is in the highway<S>4546</S> of the fuller's<S>3526</S> field<S>7704</S>. <sup>great: Heb. heavy</sup>
And when they had called<S>7121</S> to the king<S>4428</S>, there came out<S>3318</S> to them Eliakim<S>471</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hilkiah<S>2518</S>, which was over the household<S>1004</S>, and Shebna<S>7644</S> the scribe<S>5608</S>, and Joah<S>3098</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Asaph<S>623</S> the recorder<S>2142</S>. <sup>scribe: or, secretary</sup>
And Rabshakeh<S>7262</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Speak<S>559</S> ye now to Hezekiah<S>2396</S>, Thus saith<S>559</S> the great<S>1419</S> king<S>4428</S>, the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>, What confidence<S>986</S> is this wherein thou trustest<S>982</S>?
Thou sayest<S>559</S>, (but they are but vain<S>8193</S> words<S>1697</S>,) I have counsel<S>6098</S> and strength<S>1369</S> for the war<S>4421</S>. Now on whom dost thou trust<S>982</S>, that thou rebellest<S>4775</S> against me? <sup>sayest: or, talkest</sup> <sup>vain: Heb. word of the lips</sup> <sup>I have: or, but counsel and strength are for the war</sup>
Now, behold, thou trustest<S>982</S> upon the staff<S>4938</S> of this bruised<S>7533</S> reed<S>7070</S>, even upon Egypt<S>4714</S>, on which if a man<S>376</S> lean<S>5564</S>, it will go<S>935</S> into his hand<S>3709</S>, and pierce<S>5344</S> it: so is Pharaoh<S>6547</S> king<S>4428</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S> unto all that trust<S>982</S> on him. <sup>trustest: Heb. trustest thee</sup>
But if ye say<S>559</S> unto me, We trust<S>982</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> our God<S>430</S>: is not that he, whose high places<S>1116</S> and whose altars<S>4196</S> Hezekiah<S>2396</S> hath taken away<S>5493</S>, and hath said<S>559</S> to Judah<S>3063</S> and Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, Ye shall worship<S>7812</S> before<S>6440</S> this altar<S>4196</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>?
Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges<S>6148</S> to my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>, and I will deliver<S>5414</S> thee two thousand<S>505</S> horses<S>5483</S>, if thou be able<S>3201</S> on thy part to set<S>5414</S> riders<S>7392</S> upon them. <sup>pledges: or, hostages</sup>
How then wilt thou turn away<S>7725</S> the face<S>6440</S> of one<S>259</S> captain<S>6346</S> of the least<S>6996</S> of my master's<S>113</S> servants<S>5650</S>, and put thy trust<S>982</S> on Egypt<S>4714</S> for chariots<S>7393</S> and for horsemen<S>6571</S>?
Am I now come up<S>5927</S> without<S>1107</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> against this place<S>4725</S> to destroy<S>7843</S> it? The LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> to me, Go up<S>5927</S> against this land<S>776</S>, and destroy<S>7843</S> it.
Then said<S>559</S> Eliakim<S>471</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hilkiah<S>2518</S>, and Shebna<S>7644</S>, and Joah<S>3098</S>, unto Rabshakeh<S>7262</S>, Speak<S>1696</S>, I pray thee, to thy servants<S>5650</S> in the Syrian language<S>762</S>; for we understand<S>8085</S> it: and talk<S>1696</S> not with us in the Jews' language<S>3066</S> in the ears<S>241</S> of the people<S>5971</S> that are on the wall<S>2346</S>.
But Rabshakeh<S>7262</S> said<S>559</S> unto them, Hath my master<S>113</S> sent<S>7971</S> me to thy master<S>113</S>, and to thee, to speak<S>1696</S> these words<S>1697</S>? hath he not sent me to the men<S>582</S> which sit<S>3427</S> on the wall<S>2346</S>, that they may eat<S>398</S> their own dung<S>6675</S> <S>2755</S>, and drink<S>8354</S> their own piss<S>4325</S> <S>7272</S> <S>7890</S> with you? <sup>their own piss: Heb. the water of their feet</sup>
Then Rabshakeh<S>7262</S> stood<S>5975</S> and cried<S>7121</S> with a loud<S>1419</S> voice<S>6963</S> in the Jews' language<S>3066</S>, and spake<S>1696</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Hear<S>8085</S> the word<S>1697</S> of the great<S>1419</S> king<S>4428</S>, the king<S>4428</S> of Assyria<S>804</S>:

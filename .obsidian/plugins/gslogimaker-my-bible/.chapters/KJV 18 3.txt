After<S>310</S> this opened<S>6605</S> Job<S>347</S> his mouth<S>6310</S>, and cursed<S>7043</S> his day<S>3117</S>.
And Job<S>347</S> spake<S>6030</S>, and said<S>559</S>, <sup>spake: Heb. answered</sup>
Let the day<S>3117</S> perish<S>6</S> wherein I was born<S>3205</S>, and the night<S>3915</S> in which it was said<S>559</S>, There is a man child<S>1397</S> conceived<S>2029</S>.
Let that day<S>3117</S> be darkness<S>2822</S>; let not God<S>433</S> regard<S>1875</S> it from above<S>4605</S>, neither let the light<S>5105</S> shine<S>3313</S> upon it.
Let darkness<S>2822</S> and the shadow of death<S>6757</S> stain<S>1350</S> it; let a cloud<S>6053</S> dwell<S>7931</S> upon it; let the blackness<S>3650</S> of the day<S>3117</S> terrify<S>1204</S> it. <sup>stain: or, challenge</sup> <sup>let the: or, let them terrify it, as those who have a bitter day</sup>
As for that night<S>3915</S>, let darkness<S>652</S> seize<S>3947</S> upon it; let it not be joined<S>2302</S> unto the days<S>3117</S> of the year<S>8141</S>, let it not come<S>935</S> into the number<S>4557</S> of the months<S>3391</S>. <sup>let it not be: or, let it not rejoice among the days</sup>
Lo, let that night<S>3915</S> be solitary<S>1565</S>, let no joyful voice<S>7445</S> come<S>935</S> therein.
Let them curse<S>5344</S> it that curse<S>779</S> the day<S>3117</S>, who are ready<S>6264</S> to raise up<S>5782</S> their mourning<S>3882</S>. <sup>their: or, leviathan</sup>
Let the stars<S>3556</S> of the twilight<S>5399</S> thereof be dark<S>2821</S>; let it look<S>6960</S> for light<S>216</S>, but have none; neither let it see<S>7200</S> the dawning<S>6079</S> of the day<S>7837</S>: <sup>the dawning: Heb. the eyelids of the morning</sup>
Because it shut not up<S>5462</S> the doors<S>1817</S> of my mother's womb<S>990</S>, nor hid<S>5641</S> sorrow<S>5999</S> from mine eyes<S>5869</S>.
Why died<S>4191</S> I not from the womb<S>7358</S>? why did I not give up the ghost<S>1478</S> when I came out<S>3318</S> of the belly<S>990</S>?
Why did the knees<S>1290</S> prevent<S>6923</S> me? or why the breasts<S>7699</S> that I should suck<S>3243</S>?
For now should I have lain still<S>7901</S> and been quiet<S>8252</S>, I should have slept<S>3462</S>: then had I been at rest<S>5117</S>,
With kings<S>4428</S> and counsellors<S>3289</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, which built<S>1129</S> desolate places<S>2723</S> for themselves;
Or with princes<S>8269</S> that had gold<S>2091</S>, who filled<S>4390</S> their houses<S>1004</S> with silver<S>3701</S>:
Or as an hidden<S>2934</S> untimely birth<S>5309</S> I had not been; as infants<S>5768</S> which never saw<S>7200</S> light<S>216</S>.
There the wicked<S>7563</S> cease<S>2308</S> from troubling<S>7267</S>; and there the weary<S>3019</S> <S>3581</S> be at rest<S>5117</S>. <sup>weary: Heb. wearied in strength</sup>
There the prisoners<S>615</S> rest<S>7599</S> together<S>3162</S>; they hear<S>8085</S> not the voice<S>6963</S> of the oppressor<S>5065</S>.
The small<S>6996</S> and great<S>1419</S> are there; and the servant<S>5650</S> is free<S>2670</S> from his master<S>113</S>.
Wherefore is light<S>216</S> given<S>5414</S> to him that is in misery<S>6001</S>, and life<S>2416</S> unto the bitter<S>4751</S> in soul<S>5315</S>;
Which long<S>2442</S> for death<S>4194</S>, but it cometh not; and dig<S>2658</S> for it more than for hid treasures<S>4301</S>; <sup>long: Heb. wait</sup>
Which rejoice<S>8056</S> exceedingly<S>1524</S>, and are glad<S>7797</S>, when they can find<S>4672</S> the grave<S>6913</S>?
Why is light given to a man<S>1397</S> whose way<S>1870</S> is hid<S>5641</S>, and whom God<S>433</S> hath hedged in<S>5526</S>?
For my sighing<S>585</S> cometh<S>935</S> before<S>6440</S> I eat<S>3899</S>, and my roarings<S>7581</S> are poured out<S>5413</S> like the waters<S>4325</S>. <sup>I eat: Heb. my meat</sup>
For the thing which I greatly<S>6343</S> feared<S>6342</S> is come<S>857</S> upon me, and that which I was afraid<S>3025</S> of is come<S>935</S> unto me. <sup>the thing: Heb. I feared a fear, and it came upon me</sup>
I was not in safety<S>7951</S>, neither had I rest<S>8252</S>, neither was I quiet<S>5117</S>; yet trouble<S>7267</S> came<S>935</S>.

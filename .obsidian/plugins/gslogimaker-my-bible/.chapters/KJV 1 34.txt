And Dinah<S>1783</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Leah<S>3812</S>, which she bare<S>3205</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S>, went out<S>3318</S> to see<S>7200</S> the daughters<S>1323</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
And when Shechem<S>7927</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hamor<S>2544</S> the Hivite<S>2340</S>, prince<S>5387</S> of the country<S>776</S>, saw<S>7200</S> her, he took<S>3947</S> her, and lay<S>7901</S> with her, and defiled her<S>6031</S>. <sup>defiled: Heb. humbled her</sup>
And his soul<S>5315</S> clave<S>1692</S> unto Dinah<S>1783</S> the daughter<S>1323</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, and he loved<S>157</S> the damsel<S>5291</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> kindly<S>3820</S> unto the damsel<S>5291</S>. <sup>kindly: Heb. to the heart of the damsel</sup>
And Shechem<S>7927</S> spake<S>559</S> unto his father<S>1</S> Hamor<S>2544</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Get<S>3947</S> me this damsel<S>3207</S> to wife<S>802</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> heard<S>8085</S> that he had defiled<S>2930</S> Dinah<S>1783</S> his daughter<S>1323</S>: now his sons<S>1121</S> were with his cattle<S>4735</S> in the field<S>7704</S>: and Jacob<S>3290</S> held his peace<S>2790</S> until they were come<S>935</S>.
And Hamor<S>2544</S> the father<S>1</S> of Shechem<S>7927</S> went out<S>3318</S> unto Jacob<S>3290</S> to commune<S>1696</S> with<S>854</S> him.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> came<S>935</S> out of the field<S>7704</S> when they heard<S>8085</S> it: and the men<S>582</S> were grieved<S>6087</S>, and they were very<S>3966</S> wroth<S>2734</S>, because he had wrought<S>6213</S> folly<S>5039</S> in Israel<S>3478</S> in lying<S>7901</S> with Jacob's<S>3290</S> daughter<S>1323</S>; which thing ought not to be done<S>6213</S>.
And Hamor<S>2544</S> communed<S>1696</S> with them, saying<S>559</S>, The soul<S>5315</S> of my son<S>1121</S> Shechem<S>7927</S> longeth<S>2836</S> for your daughter<S>1323</S>: I pray you give<S>5414</S> her him to wife<S>802</S>.
And make ye marriages<S>2859</S> with us, and give<S>5414</S> your daughters<S>1323</S> unto us, and take<S>3947</S> our daughters<S>1323</S> unto you.
And ye shall dwell<S>3427</S> with us: and the land<S>776</S> shall be<S>1961</S> before you<S>6440</S>; dwell<S>3427</S> and trade<S>5503</S> ye therein, and get you possessions<S>270</S> therein.
And Shechem<S>7927</S> said<S>559</S> unto her father<S>1</S> and unto her brethren<S>251</S>, Let me find<S>4672</S> grace<S>2580</S> in your eyes<S>5869</S>, and what ye shall say<S>559</S> unto me I will give<S>5414</S>.
Ask<S>7235</S> me never so much<S>3966</S> dowry<S>4119</S> and gift<S>4976</S>, and I will give<S>5414</S> according as ye shall say<S>559</S> unto me: but give<S>5414</S> me the damsel<S>5291</S> to wife<S>802</S>.
And the sons<S>1121</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> answered<S>6030</S> Shechem<S>7927</S> and Hamor<S>2544</S> his father<S>1</S> deceitfully<S>4820</S>, and said<S>1696</S>, because he had defiled<S>2930</S> Dinah<S>1783</S> their sister<S>269</S>:
And they said<S>559</S> unto them, We cannot<S>3808</S> <S>3201</S> do<S>6213</S> this thing<S>1697</S>, to give<S>5414</S> our sister<S>269</S> to one<S>376</S> that is uncircumcised<S>6190</S>; for that were a reproach<S>2781</S> unto us:
But in this<S>2063</S> will we consent<S>225</S> unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male<S>2145</S> of you be circumcised<S>4135</S>;
Then will we give<S>5414</S> our daughters<S>1323</S> unto you, and we will take<S>3947</S> your daughters<S>1323</S> to us, and we will dwell<S>3427</S> with you, and we will become one<S>259</S> people<S>5971</S>.
But if ye will not hearken<S>8085</S> unto us, to be circumcised<S>4135</S>; then will we take<S>3947</S> our daughter<S>1323</S>, and we will be gone<S>1980</S>.
And their words<S>1697</S> pleased<S>3190</S> <S>5869</S> Hamor<S>2544</S>, and Shechem<S>7927</S> Hamor's<S>2544</S> son<S>1121</S>.
And the young man<S>5288</S> deferred<S>309</S> not to do<S>6213</S> the thing<S>1697</S>, because he had delight<S>2654</S> in Jacob's<S>3290</S> daughter<S>1323</S>: and he was more honourable<S>3513</S> than all the house<S>1004</S> of his father<S>1</S>.
And Hamor<S>2544</S> and Shechem<S>7927</S> his son<S>1121</S> came<S>935</S> unto the gate<S>8179</S> of their city<S>5892</S>, and communed<S>1696</S> with the men<S>582</S> of their city<S>5892</S>, saying<S>559</S>,
These men<S>582</S> are peaceable<S>8003</S> with<S>854</S> us; therefore let them dwell<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S>, and trade<S>5503</S> therein; for the land<S>776</S>, behold, it is large<S>7342</S> enough<S>3027</S> for them<S>6440</S>; let us take<S>3947</S> their daughters<S>1323</S> to us for wives<S>802</S>, and let us give<S>5414</S> them our daughters<S>1323</S>.
Only herein<S>2063</S> will the men<S>582</S> consent<S>225</S> unto us for to dwell<S>3427</S> with us, to be one<S>259</S> people<S>5971</S>, if every male<S>2145</S> among us be circumcised<S>4135</S>, as they are circumcised<S>4135</S>.
Shall not their cattle<S>4735</S> and their substance<S>7075</S> and every beast<S>929</S> of theirs be ours? only let us consent<S>225</S> unto them, and they will dwell<S>3427</S> with us.
And unto Hamor<S>2544</S> and unto Shechem<S>7927</S> his son<S>1121</S> hearkened<S>8085</S> all that went out<S>3318</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> of his city<S>5892</S>; and every male<S>2145</S> was circumcised<S>4135</S>, all that went out<S>3318</S> of the gate<S>8179</S> of his city<S>5892</S>.
And it came to pass on the third<S>7992</S> day<S>3117</S>, when they were sore<S>3510</S>, that two<S>8147</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, Simeon<S>8095</S> and Levi<S>3878</S>, Dinah's<S>1783</S> brethren<S>251</S>, took<S>3947</S> each man<S>376</S> his sword<S>2719</S>, and came<S>935</S> upon the city<S>5892</S> boldly<S>983</S>, and slew<S>2026</S> all the males<S>2145</S>.
And they slew<S>2026</S> Hamor<S>2544</S> and Shechem<S>7927</S> his son<S>1121</S> with the edge<S>6310</S> of the sword<S>2719</S>, and took<S>3947</S> Dinah<S>1783</S> out<S>3947</S> of Shechem's<S>7927</S> house<S>1004</S>, and went out<S>3318</S>. <sup>edge: Heb. mouth</sup>
The sons<S>1121</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S> came<S>935</S> upon the slain<S>2491</S>, and spoiled<S>962</S> the city<S>5892</S>, because they had defiled<S>2930</S> their sister<S>269</S>.
They took<S>3947</S> their sheep<S>6629</S>, and their oxen<S>1241</S>, and their asses<S>2543</S>, and that which was in the city<S>5892</S>, and that which was in the field<S>7704</S>,
And all their wealth<S>2428</S>, and all their little ones<S>2945</S>, and their wives<S>802</S> took they captive<S>7617</S>, and spoiled<S>962</S> even all that was in the house<S>1004</S>.
And Jacob<S>3290</S> said<S>559</S> to Simeon<S>8095</S> and Levi<S>3878</S>, Ye have troubled<S>5916</S> me to make me to stink<S>887</S> among the inhabitants<S>3427</S> of the land<S>776</S>, among the Canaanites<S>3669</S> and the Perizzites<S>6522</S>: and I being few<S>4962</S> in number<S>4557</S>, they shall gather themselves together<S>622</S> against me, and slay me<S>5221</S>; and I shall be destroyed<S>8045</S>, I and my house<S>1004</S>.
And they said<S>559</S>, Should he deal<S>6213</S> with our sister<S>269</S> as with an harlot<S>2181</S>?

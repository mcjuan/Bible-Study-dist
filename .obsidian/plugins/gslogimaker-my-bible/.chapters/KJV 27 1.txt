In the third<S>7969</S> year<S>8141</S> of the reign<S>4438</S> of Jehoiakim<S>3079</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> came<S>935</S> Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S> king<S>4428</S> of Babylon<S>894</S> unto Jerusalem<S>3389</S>, and besieged<S>6696</S> it.
And the Lord<S>136</S> gave<S>5414</S> Jehoiakim<S>3079</S> king<S>4428</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> into his hand<S>3027</S>, with part<S>7117</S> of the vessels<S>3627</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>: which he carried<S>935</S> into the land<S>776</S> of Shinar<S>8152</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of his god<S>430</S>; and he brought<S>935</S> the vessels<S>3627</S> into the treasure<S>214</S> house<S>1004</S> of his god<S>430</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> spake<S>559</S> unto Ashpenaz<S>828</S> the master<S>7227</S> of his eunuchs<S>5631</S>, that he should bring<S>935</S> certain of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and of the king's<S>4410</S> seed<S>2233</S>, and of the princes<S>6579</S>;
Children<S>3206</S> in whom was no blemish<S>3971</S> <S>3971</S>, but well<S>2896</S> favoured<S>4758</S>, and skilful<S>7919</S> in all wisdom<S>2451</S>, and cunning<S>3045</S> in knowledge<S>1847</S>, and understanding<S>995</S> science<S>4093</S>, and such as had ability<S>3581</S> in them to stand<S>5975</S> in the king's<S>4428</S> palace<S>1964</S>, and whom they might teach<S>3925</S> the learning<S>5612</S> and the tongue<S>3956</S> of the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> appointed<S>4487</S> them a daily<S>3117</S> <S>3117</S> provision<S>1697</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> meat<S>6598</S>, and of the wine<S>3196</S> which he drank<S>4960</S>: so nourishing<S>1431</S> them three<S>7969</S> years<S>8141</S>, that at the end<S>7117</S> thereof they might stand<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S>. <sup>the wine: Heb. the wine of his drink</sup>
Now among these were of the children<S>1121</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, Daniel<S>1840</S>, Hananiah<S>2608</S>, Mishael<S>4332</S>, and Azariah<S>5838</S>:
Unto whom the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S> gave<S>7760</S> names<S>8034</S>: for he gave<S>7760</S> unto Daniel<S>1840</S> the name of Belteshazzar<S>1095</S>; and to Hananiah<S>2608</S>, of Shadrach<S>7714</S>; and to Mishael<S>4332</S>, of Meshach<S>4335</S>; and to Azariah<S>5838</S>, of Abednego<S>5664</S>.
But Daniel<S>1840</S> purposed<S>7760</S> in his heart<S>3820</S> that he would not defile<S>1351</S> himself with the portion<S>6598</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> meat<S>6598</S>, nor with the wine<S>3196</S> which he drank<S>4960</S>: therefore he requested<S>1245</S> of the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S> that he might not defile<S>1351</S> himself.
Now God<S>430</S> had brought<S>5414</S> Daniel<S>1840</S> into favour<S>2617</S> and tender love<S>7356</S> with<S>6440</S> the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S>.
And the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S> said<S>559</S> unto Daniel<S>1840</S>, I fear<S>3373</S> my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S>, who hath appointed<S>4487</S> your meat<S>3978</S> and your drink<S>4960</S>: for why should he see<S>7200</S> your faces<S>6440</S> worse liking<S>2196</S> than the children<S>3206</S> which are of your sort<S>1524</S>? then shall ye make me endanger<S>2325</S> my head<S>7218</S> to the king<S>4428</S>. <sup>worse: Heb. sadder</sup> <sup>sort: or, term, or, continuance?</sup>
Then said<S>559</S> Daniel<S>1840</S> to Melzar<S>4453</S>, whom the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S> had set<S>4487</S> over Daniel<S>1840</S>, Hananiah<S>2608</S>, Mishael<S>4332</S>, and Azariah<S>5838</S>, <sup>Melzar: or, the steward</sup>
Prove<S>5254</S> thy servants<S>5650</S>, I beseech thee, ten<S>6235</S> days<S>3117</S>; and let them give<S>5414</S> us pulse<S>2235</S> to eat<S>398</S>, and water<S>4325</S> to drink<S>8354</S>. <sup>pulse: Heb. of pulse</sup> <sup>to eat: Heb. that we may eat, etc</sup>
Then let our countenances<S>4758</S> be looked upon<S>7200</S> before<S>6440</S> thee, and the countenance<S>4758</S> of the children<S>3206</S> that eat<S>398</S> of the portion<S>6598</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> meat<S>6598</S>: and as thou seest<S>7200</S>, deal<S>6213</S> with thy servants<S>5650</S>.
So he consented<S>8085</S> to them in this matter<S>1697</S>, and proved<S>5254</S> them ten<S>6235</S> days<S>3117</S>.
And at the end<S>7117</S> of ten<S>6235</S> days<S>3117</S> their countenances<S>4758</S> appeared<S>7200</S> fairer<S>2896</S> and fatter<S>1277</S> in flesh<S>1320</S> than all the children<S>3206</S> which did eat<S>398</S> the portion<S>6598</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> meat<S>6598</S>.
Thus Melzar<S>4453</S> took away<S>5375</S> the portion of their meat<S>6598</S>, and the wine<S>3196</S> that they should drink<S>4960</S>; and gave<S>5414</S> them pulse<S>2235</S>.
As for these four<S>702</S> children<S>3206</S>, God<S>430</S> gave<S>5414</S> them knowledge<S>4093</S> and skill<S>7919</S> in all learning<S>5612</S> and wisdom<S>2451</S>: and Daniel<S>1840</S> had understanding<S>995</S> in all visions<S>2377</S> and dreams<S>2472</S>. <sup>Daniel: or, he made Daniel understand</sup>
Now at the end<S>7117</S> of the days<S>3117</S> that the king<S>4428</S> had said<S>559</S> he should bring<S>935</S> them in, then the prince<S>8269</S> of the eunuchs<S>5631</S> brought<S>935</S> them in before<S>6440</S> Nebuchadnezzar<S>5019</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> communed<S>1696</S> with them; and among them all was found<S>4672</S> none like Daniel<S>1840</S>, Hananiah<S>2608</S>, Mishael<S>4332</S>, and Azariah<S>5838</S>: therefore stood<S>5975</S> they before<S>6440</S> the king<S>4428</S>.
And in all matters<S>1697</S> of wisdom<S>2451</S> and understanding<S>998</S>, that the king<S>4428</S> enquired<S>1245</S> of them, he found<S>4672</S> them ten times<S>6235</S> better<S>3027</S> than all the magicians<S>2748</S> and astrologers<S>825</S> that were in all his realm<S>4438</S>. <sup>wisdom: Heb. wisdom of understanding</sup>
And Daniel<S>1840</S> continued even unto the first<S>259</S> year<S>8141</S> of king<S>4428</S> Cyrus<S>3566</S>.

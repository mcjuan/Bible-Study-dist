And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S>, Is there yet<S>3426</S> any that is left<S>3498</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, that I may shew<S>6213</S> him kindness<S>2617</S> for Jonathan's<S>3083</S> sake?
And there was of the house<S>1004</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> a servant<S>5650</S> whose name<S>8034</S> was Ziba<S>6717</S>. And when they had called<S>7121</S> him unto David<S>1732</S>, the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Art thou Ziba<S>6717</S>? And he said<S>559</S>, Thy servant<S>5650</S> is he.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S>, Is there not<S>657</S> yet any<S>376</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, that I may shew<S>6213</S> the kindness<S>2617</S> of God<S>430</S> unto him? And Ziba<S>6717</S> said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, Jonathan<S>3083</S> hath yet a son<S>1121</S>, which is lame<S>5223</S> on his feet<S>7272</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Where<S>375</S> is he? And Ziba<S>6717</S> said<S>559</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, Behold, he is in the house<S>1004</S> of Machir<S>4353</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Ammiel<S>5988</S>, in Lodebar<S>3810</S>.
Then king<S>4428</S> David<S>1732</S> sent<S>7971</S>, and fetched<S>3947</S> him out of the house<S>1004</S> of Machir<S>4353</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Ammiel<S>5988</S>, from Lodebar<S>3810</S>.
Now when Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Jonathan<S>3083</S>, the son<S>1121</S> of Saul<S>7586</S>, was come<S>935</S> unto David<S>1732</S>, he fell<S>5307</S> on his face<S>6440</S>, and did reverence<S>7812</S>. And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S>, Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>. And he answered<S>559</S>, Behold thy servant<S>5650</S>!
And David<S>1732</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Fear<S>3372</S> not: for I will surely<S>6213</S> shew<S>6213</S> thee kindness<S>2617</S> for Jonathan<S>3083</S> thy father's<S>1</S> sake, and will restore<S>7725</S> thee all the land<S>7704</S> of Saul<S>7586</S> thy father<S>1</S>; and thou shalt eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> at my table<S>7979</S> continually<S>8548</S>.
And he bowed<S>7812</S> himself, and said<S>559</S>, What is thy servant<S>5650</S>, that thou shouldest look<S>6437</S> upon such a dead<S>4191</S> dog<S>3611</S> as I am?
Then the king<S>4428</S> called<S>7121</S> to Ziba<S>6717</S>, Saul's<S>7586</S> servant<S>5288</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, I have given<S>5414</S> unto thy master's<S>113</S> son<S>1121</S> all that pertained<S>1961</S> to Saul<S>7586</S> and to all his house<S>1004</S>.
Thou therefore, and thy sons<S>1121</S>, and thy servants<S>5650</S>, shall till<S>5647</S> the land<S>127</S> for him, and thou shalt bring<S>935</S> in the fruits, that thy master's<S>113</S> son<S>1121</S> may have food<S>3899</S> to eat<S>398</S>: but Mephibosheth<S>4648</S> thy master's<S>113</S> son<S>1121</S> shall eat<S>398</S> bread<S>3899</S> alway<S>8548</S> at my table<S>7979</S>. Now Ziba<S>6717</S> had fifteen<S>2568</S> <S>6240</S> sons<S>1121</S> and twenty<S>6242</S> servants<S>5650</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Ziba<S>6717</S> unto the king<S>4428</S>, According to all that my lord<S>113</S> the king<S>4428</S> hath commanded<S>6680</S> his servant<S>5650</S>, so shall thy servant<S>5650</S> do<S>6213</S>. As for Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>, said the king, he shall eat<S>398</S> at my table<S>7979</S>, as one<S>259</S> of the king's<S>4428</S> sons<S>1121</S>.
And Mephibosheth<S>4648</S> had a young<S>6996</S> son<S>1121</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Micha<S>4316</S>. And all that dwelt<S>4186</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of Ziba<S>6717</S> were servants<S>5650</S> unto Mephibosheth<S>4648</S>.
So Mephibosheth<S>4648</S> dwelt<S>3427</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S>: for he did eat<S>398</S> continually<S>8548</S> at the king's<S>4428</S> table<S>7979</S>; and was lame<S>6455</S> on both<S>8147</S> his feet<S>7272</S>.

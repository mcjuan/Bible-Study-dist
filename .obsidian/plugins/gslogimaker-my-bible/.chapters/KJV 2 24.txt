And he said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Come up<S>5927</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>, thou, and Aaron<S>175</S>, Nadab<S>5070</S>, and Abihu<S>30</S>, and seventy<S>7657</S> of the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; and worship<S>7812</S> ye afar off<S>7350</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> alone shall come near<S>5066</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>: but they shall not come nigh<S>5066</S>; neither shall the people<S>5971</S> go up<S>5927</S> with him.
And Moses<S>4872</S> came<S>935</S> and told<S>5608</S> the people<S>5971</S> all the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and all the judgments<S>4941</S>: and all the people<S>5971</S> answered<S>6030</S> with one<S>259</S> voice<S>6963</S>, and said<S>559</S>, All the words<S>1697</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>1696</S> will we do<S>6213</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> wrote<S>3789</S> all the words<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and rose up early<S>7925</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and builded<S>1129</S> an altar<S>4196</S> under the hill<S>2022</S>, and twelve pillars<S>4676</S>, according to the twelve<S>8147</S> <S>6240</S> tribes<S>7626</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And he sent<S>7971</S> young men<S>5288</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which offered<S>5927</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, and sacrificed<S>2076</S> peace<S>8002</S> offerings<S>2077</S> of oxen<S>6499</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> half<S>2677</S> of the blood<S>1818</S>, and put<S>7760</S> it in basons<S>101</S>; and half<S>2677</S> of the blood<S>1818</S> he sprinkled<S>2236</S> on the altar<S>4196</S>.
And he took<S>3947</S> the book<S>5612</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, and read<S>7121</S> in the audience<S>241</S> of the people<S>5971</S>: and they said<S>559</S>, All that the LORD<S>3068</S> hath said<S>1696</S> will we do<S>6213</S>, and be obedient<S>8085</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> took<S>3947</S> the blood<S>1818</S>, and sprinkled<S>2236</S> it on the people<S>5971</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold the blood<S>1818</S> of the covenant<S>1285</S>, which the LORD<S>3068</S> hath made<S>3772</S> with you concerning all these words<S>1697</S>.
Then went up<S>5927</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, and Aaron<S>175</S>, Nadab<S>5070</S>, and Abihu<S>30</S>, and seventy<S>7657</S> of the elders<S>2205</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>:
And they saw<S>7200</S> the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>: and there was under his feet<S>7272</S> as it were a paved<S>3840</S> work<S>4639</S> of a sapphire stone<S>5601</S>, and as it were the body<S>6106</S> of heaven<S>8064</S> in his clearness<S>2892</S>.
And upon the nobles<S>678</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> he laid<S>7971</S> not his hand<S>3027</S>: also they saw<S>2372</S> God<S>430</S>, and did eat<S>398</S> and drink<S>8354</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S>, Come up<S>5927</S> to me into the mount<S>2022</S>, and be there: and I will give<S>5414</S> thee tables<S>3871</S> of stone<S>68</S>, and a law<S>8451</S>, and commandments<S>4687</S> which I have written<S>3789</S>; that thou mayest teach<S>3384</S> them.
And Moses<S>4872</S> rose up<S>6965</S>, and his minister<S>8334</S> Joshua<S>3091</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> went up<S>5927</S> into the mount<S>2022</S> of God<S>430</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S>, Tarry<S>3427</S> ye here<S>2088</S> for us, until we come again<S>7725</S> unto you: and, behold, Aaron<S>175</S> and Hur<S>2354</S> are with you: if any<S>4310</S> man<S>1167</S> have any matters<S>1697</S> to do<S>1167</S>, let him come<S>5066</S> unto them.
And Moses<S>4872</S> went up<S>5927</S> into the mount<S>2022</S>, and a cloud<S>6051</S> covered<S>3680</S> the mount<S>2022</S>.
And the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> abode<S>7931</S> upon mount<S>2022</S> Sinai<S>5514</S>, and the cloud<S>6051</S> covered<S>3680</S> it six<S>8337</S> days<S>3117</S>: and the seventh<S>7637</S> day<S>3117</S> he called<S>7121</S> unto Moses<S>4872</S> out of the midst<S>8432</S> of the cloud<S>6051</S>.
And the sight<S>4758</S> of the glory<S>3519</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> was like devouring<S>398</S> fire<S>784</S> on the top<S>7218</S> of the mount<S>2022</S> in the eyes<S>5869</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And Moses<S>4872</S> went<S>935</S> into the midst<S>8432</S> of the cloud<S>6051</S>, and gat him up<S>5927</S> into the mount<S>2022</S>: and Moses<S>4872</S> was in the mount<S>2022</S> forty<S>705</S> days<S>3117</S> and forty<S>705</S> nights<S>3915</S>.

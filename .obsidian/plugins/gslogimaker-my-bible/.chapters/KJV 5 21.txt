If one be found<S>4672</S> slain<S>2491</S> in the land<S>127</S> which the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> giveth<S>5414</S> thee to possess<S>3423</S> it, lying<S>5307</S> in the field<S>7704</S>, and it be not known<S>3045</S> who hath slain<S>5221</S> him:
Then thy elders<S>2205</S> and thy judges<S>8199</S> shall come forth<S>3318</S>, and they shall measure<S>4058</S> unto the cities<S>5892</S> which are round about<S>5439</S> him that is slain<S>2491</S>:
And it shall be, that the city<S>5892</S> which is next<S>7138</S> unto the slain man<S>2491</S>, even the elders<S>2205</S> of that city<S>5892</S> shall take<S>3947</S> an heifer<S>1241</S> <S>5697</S>, which hath not been wrought with<S>5647</S>, and which hath not drawn<S>4900</S> in the yoke<S>5923</S>;
And the elders<S>2205</S> of that city<S>5892</S> shall bring down<S>3381</S> the heifer<S>5697</S> unto a rough<S>386</S> valley<S>5158</S>, which is neither eared<S>5647</S> nor sown<S>2232</S>, and shall strike off<S>6202</S> the heifer's<S>5697</S> neck<S>6202</S> there in the valley<S>5158</S>:
And the priests<S>3548</S> the sons<S>1121</S> of Levi<S>3878</S> shall come near<S>5066</S>; for them the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath chosen<S>977</S> to minister<S>8334</S> unto him, and to bless<S>1288</S> in the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and by their word<S>6310</S> shall every controversy<S>7379</S> and every stroke<S>5061</S> be tried: <sup>word: Heb. mouth</sup>
And all the elders<S>2205</S> of that city<S>5892</S>, that are next<S>7138</S> unto the slain<S>2491</S> man, shall wash<S>7364</S> their hands<S>3027</S> over the heifer<S>5697</S> that is beheaded<S>6202</S> in the valley<S>5158</S>:
And they shall answer<S>6030</S> and say<S>559</S>, Our hands<S>3027</S> have not shed<S>8210</S> this blood<S>1818</S>, neither have our eyes<S>5869</S> seen<S>7200</S> it.
Be merciful<S>3722</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, unto thy people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>, whom thou hast redeemed<S>6299</S>, and lay<S>5414</S> not innocent<S>5355</S> blood<S>1818</S> unto thy people<S>5971</S> of Israel's<S>3478</S> charge<S>7130</S>. And the blood<S>1818</S> shall be forgiven<S>3722</S> them. <sup>unto thy people of: Heb. in the midst, etc</sup>
So shalt thou put away<S>1197</S> the guilt of innocent<S>5355</S> blood<S>1818</S> from among<S>7130</S> you, when thou shalt do<S>6213</S> that which is right<S>3477</S> in the sight<S>5869</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
When thou goest forth<S>3318</S> to war<S>4421</S> against thine enemies<S>341</S>, and the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> hath delivered<S>5414</S> them into thine hands<S>3027</S>, and thou hast taken<S>7617</S> them captive<S>7628</S>,
And seest<S>7200</S> among the captives<S>7633</S> a beautiful<S>8389</S> <S>3303</S> woman<S>802</S>, and hast a desire<S>2836</S> unto her, that thou wouldest have her<S>3947</S> to thy wife<S>802</S>;
Then thou shalt bring<S>935</S> her home<S>8432</S> to thine house<S>1004</S>; and she shall shave<S>1548</S> her head<S>7218</S>, and pare<S>6213</S> her nails<S>6856</S>; <sup>pare: or, suffer to grow: Heb. make, or, dress</sup>
And she shall put<S>5493</S> the raiment<S>8071</S> of her captivity<S>7628</S> from off her, and shall remain<S>3427</S> in thine house<S>1004</S>, and bewail<S>1058</S> her father<S>1</S> and her mother<S>517</S> a full<S>3117</S> month<S>3391</S>: and after<S>310</S> that thou shalt go<S>935</S> in unto her, and be her husband<S>1166</S>, and she shall be thy wife<S>802</S>.
And it shall be, if thou have no delight<S>2654</S> in her, then thou shalt let her go<S>7971</S> whither she will<S>5315</S>; but thou shalt not sell<S>4376</S> her at all<S>4376</S> for money<S>3701</S>, thou shalt not make merchandise<S>6014</S> of her, because<S>834</S> thou hast humbled<S>6031</S> her.
If a man<S>376</S> have two<S>8147</S> wives<S>802</S>, one<S>259</S> beloved<S>157</S>, and another<S>259</S> hated<S>8130</S>, and they have born<S>3205</S> him children<S>1121</S>, both the beloved<S>157</S> and the hated<S>8130</S>; and if the firstborn<S>1060</S> son<S>1121</S> be hers that was hated<S>8146</S>:
Then it shall be, when<S>3117</S> he maketh his sons<S>1121</S> to inherit<S>5157</S> that which he hath, that he may<S>3201</S> not make the son<S>1121</S> of the beloved<S>157</S> firstborn<S>1069</S> before<S>6440</S> the son<S>1121</S> of the hated<S>8130</S>, which is indeed the firstborn<S>1060</S>:
But he shall acknowledge<S>5234</S> the son<S>1121</S> of the hated<S>8130</S> for the firstborn<S>1060</S>, by giving<S>5414</S> him a double<S>8147</S> portion<S>6310</S> of all that he hath<S>4672</S>: for he is the beginning<S>7225</S> of his strength<S>202</S>; the right<S>4941</S> of the firstborn<S>1062</S> is his. <sup>that: Heb. that is found with him</sup>
If a man<S>376</S> have a stubborn<S>5637</S> and rebellious<S>4784</S> son<S>1121</S>, which will not obey<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of his father<S>1</S>, or the voice<S>6963</S> of his mother<S>517</S>, and that, when they have chastened<S>3256</S> him, will not hearken<S>8085</S> unto them:
Then shall his father<S>1</S> and his mother<S>517</S> lay hold<S>8610</S> on him, and bring him out<S>3318</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S> of his city<S>5892</S>, and unto the gate<S>8179</S> of his place<S>4725</S>;
And they shall say<S>559</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S> of his city<S>5892</S>, This our son<S>1121</S> is stubborn<S>5637</S> and rebellious<S>4784</S>, he will not obey<S>8085</S> our voice<S>6963</S>; he is a glutton<S>2151</S>, and a drunkard<S>5433</S>.
And all the men<S>582</S> of his city<S>5892</S> shall stone<S>7275</S> him with stones<S>68</S>, that he die<S>4191</S>: so shalt thou put<S>1197</S> evil<S>7451</S> away<S>1197</S> from among<S>7130</S> you; and all Israel<S>3478</S> shall hear<S>8085</S>, and fear<S>3372</S>.

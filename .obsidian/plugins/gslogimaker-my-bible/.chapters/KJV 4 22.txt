And the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> set forward<S>5265</S>, and pitched<S>2583</S> in the plains<S>6160</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> on this side<S>5676</S> Jordan<S>3383</S> by Jericho<S>3405</S>.
And Balak<S>1111</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zippor<S>6834</S> saw<S>7200</S> all that Israel<S>3478</S> had done<S>6213</S> to the Amorites<S>567</S>.
And Moab<S>4124</S> was sore<S>3966</S> afraid<S>1481</S> of<S>6440</S> the people<S>5971</S>, because they were many<S>7227</S>: and Moab<S>4124</S> was distressed<S>6973</S> because of<S>6440</S> the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And Moab<S>4124</S> said<S>559</S> unto the elders<S>2205</S> of Midian<S>4080</S>, Now shall this company<S>6951</S> lick up<S>3897</S> all that are round about<S>5439</S> us, as the ox<S>7794</S> licketh up<S>3897</S> the grass<S>3418</S> of the field<S>7704</S>. And Balak<S>1111</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zippor<S>6834</S> was king<S>4428</S> of the Moabites<S>4124</S> at that time<S>6256</S>.
He sent<S>7971</S> messengers<S>4397</S> therefore unto Balaam<S>1109</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Beor<S>1160</S> to Pethor<S>6604</S>, which is by the river<S>5104</S> of the land<S>776</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of his people<S>5971</S>, to call<S>7121</S> him, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, there is a people<S>5971</S> come out<S>3318</S> from Egypt<S>4714</S>: behold, they cover<S>3680</S> the face<S>5869</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and they abide<S>3427</S> over against<S>4136</S> me: <sup>face: Heb. eye</sup>
Come<S>3212</S> now therefore, I pray thee, curse<S>779</S> me this people<S>5971</S>; for they are too mighty<S>6099</S> for me: peradventure I shall prevail<S>3201</S>, that we may smite<S>5221</S> them, and that I may drive them out<S>1644</S> of the land<S>776</S>: for I wot<S>3045</S> that he whom thou blessest<S>1288</S> is blessed<S>1288</S>, and he whom thou cursest<S>779</S> is cursed<S>779</S>.
And the elders<S>2205</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> and the elders<S>2205</S> of Midian<S>4080</S> departed<S>3212</S> with the rewards of divination<S>7081</S> in their hand<S>3027</S>; and they came<S>935</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> unto him the words<S>1697</S> of Balak<S>1111</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto them, Lodge<S>3885</S> here this night<S>3915</S>, and I will bring<S>7725</S> you word<S>1697</S> again<S>7725</S>, as the LORD<S>3068</S> shall speak<S>1696</S> unto me: and the princes<S>8269</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> abode<S>3427</S> with Balaam<S>1109</S>.
And God<S>430</S> came<S>935</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, and said<S>559</S>, What men<S>582</S> are these with thee?
And Balaam<S>1109</S> said<S>559</S> unto God<S>430</S>, Balak<S>1111</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zippor<S>6834</S>, king<S>4428</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, hath sent<S>7971</S> unto me, saying,
Behold, there is a people<S>5971</S> come out<S>3318</S> of Egypt<S>4714</S>, which covereth<S>3680</S> the face<S>5869</S> of the earth<S>776</S>: come<S>3212</S> now, curse<S>6895</S> me them; peradventure I shall be able<S>3201</S> to overcome<S>3898</S> them, and drive them out<S>1644</S>. <sup>I shall: Heb. I shall prevail in fighting against him</sup>
And God<S>430</S> said<S>559</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, Thou shalt not go<S>3212</S> with them; thou shalt not curse<S>779</S> the people<S>5971</S>: for they are blessed<S>1288</S>.
And Balaam<S>1109</S> rose up<S>6965</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto the princes<S>8269</S> of Balak<S>1111</S>, Get<S>3212</S> you into your land<S>776</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> refuseth<S>3985</S> to give me leave<S>5414</S> to go<S>1980</S> with you.
And the princes<S>8269</S> of Moab<S>4124</S> rose up<S>6965</S>, and they went<S>935</S> unto Balak<S>1111</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Balaam<S>1109</S> refuseth<S>3985</S> to come<S>1980</S> with us.
And Balak<S>1111</S> sent<S>7971</S> yet again<S>3254</S> princes<S>8269</S>, more<S>7227</S>, and more honourable<S>3513</S> than they.
And they came<S>935</S> to Balaam<S>1109</S>, and said<S>559</S> to him, Thus saith<S>559</S> Balak<S>1111</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zippor<S>6834</S>, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder<S>4513</S> thee from coming<S>1980</S> unto me: <sup>Let: Heb. Be not thou hindered from, etc</sup>
For I will promote<S>3513</S> thee unto very<S>3966</S> great<S>3513</S> honour<S>3513</S>, and I will do<S>6213</S> whatsoever thou sayest<S>559</S> unto me: come<S>3212</S> therefore, I pray thee, curse<S>6895</S> me this people<S>5971</S>.
And Balaam<S>1109</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto the servants<S>5650</S> of Balak<S>1111</S>, If Balak<S>1111</S> would give<S>5414</S> me his house<S>1004</S> full<S>4393</S> of silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>, I cannot<S>3201</S> go beyond<S>5674</S> the word<S>6310</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> my God<S>430</S>, to do<S>6213</S> less<S>6996</S> or more<S>1419</S>.
Now therefore, I pray you, tarry<S>3427</S> ye also here this night<S>3915</S>, that I may know<S>3045</S> what the LORD<S>3068</S> will say<S>1696</S> unto me more<S>3254</S>.
And God<S>430</S> came<S>935</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S> at night<S>3915</S>, and said<S>559</S> unto him, If the men<S>582</S> come<S>935</S> to call<S>7121</S> thee, rise up<S>6965</S>, and go<S>3212</S> with them; but yet<S>389</S> the word<S>1697</S> which I shall say<S>1696</S> unto thee, that shalt thou do<S>6213</S>.
And Balaam<S>1109</S> rose up<S>6965</S> in the morning<S>1242</S>, and saddled<S>2280</S> his ass<S>860</S>, and went<S>3212</S> with the princes<S>8269</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>.
And God's<S>430</S> anger<S>639</S> was kindled<S>2734</S> because he went<S>1980</S>: and the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> stood<S>3320</S> in the way<S>1870</S> for an adversary<S>7854</S> against him. Now he was riding<S>7392</S> upon his ass<S>860</S>, and his two<S>8147</S> servants<S>5288</S> were with him.
And the ass<S>860</S> saw<S>7200</S> the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> standing<S>5324</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, and his sword<S>2719</S> drawn<S>8025</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>: and the ass<S>860</S> turned aside<S>5186</S> out of the way<S>1870</S>, and went<S>3212</S> into the field<S>7704</S>: and Balaam<S>1109</S> smote<S>5221</S> the ass<S>860</S>, to turn<S>5186</S> her into the way<S>1870</S>.
But the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> stood<S>5975</S> in a path<S>4934</S> of the vineyards<S>3754</S>, a wall<S>1447</S> being on this side, and a wall<S>1447</S> on that side.
And when the ass<S>860</S> saw<S>7200</S> the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, she thrust<S>3905</S> herself unto the wall<S>7023</S>, and crushed<S>3905</S> Balaam's<S>1109</S> foot<S>7272</S> against the wall<S>7023</S>: and he smote<S>5221</S> her again<S>3254</S>.
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> went<S>5674</S> further<S>3254</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> in a narrow<S>6862</S> place<S>4725</S>, where was no way<S>1870</S> to turn<S>5186</S> either to the right hand<S>3225</S> or to the left<S>8040</S>.
And when the ass<S>860</S> saw<S>7200</S> the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, she fell down<S>7257</S> under Balaam<S>1109</S>: and Balaam's<S>1109</S> anger<S>639</S> was kindled<S>2734</S>, and he smote<S>5221</S> the ass<S>860</S> with a staff<S>4731</S>.
And the LORD<S>3068</S> opened<S>6605</S> the mouth<S>6310</S> of the ass<S>860</S>, and she said<S>559</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, What have I done<S>6213</S> unto thee, that thou hast smitten<S>5221</S> me these three<S>7969</S> times<S>7272</S>?
And Balaam<S>1109</S> said<S>559</S> unto the ass<S>860</S>, Because thou hast mocked<S>5953</S> me: I would<S>3863</S> there were<S>3426</S> a sword<S>2719</S> in mine hand<S>3027</S>, for now would I kill<S>2026</S> thee.
And the ass<S>860</S> said<S>559</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, Am not I thine ass<S>860</S>, upon which thou hast ridden<S>7392</S> ever since I was thine unto this day<S>3117</S>? was I ever<S>5532</S> wont<S>5532</S> to do so<S>6213</S> unto thee? And he said<S>559</S>, Nay. <sup>upon: Heb. who hast ridden upon me</sup> <sup>ever since: or, ever since thou wast, etc</sup>
Then the LORD<S>3068</S> opened<S>1540</S> the eyes<S>5869</S> of Balaam<S>1109</S>, and he saw<S>7200</S> the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> standing<S>5324</S> in the way<S>1870</S>, and his sword<S>2719</S> drawn<S>8025</S> in his hand<S>3027</S>: and he bowed down<S>6915</S> his head, and fell flat<S>7812</S> on his face<S>639</S>. <sup>fell: or, bowed himself</sup>
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten<S>5221</S> thine ass<S>860</S> these three<S>7969</S> times<S>7272</S>? behold, I went out<S>3318</S> to withstand<S>7854</S> thee, because thy way<S>1870</S> is perverse<S>3399</S> before me: <sup>to: Heb. to be an adversary unto thee</sup>
And the ass<S>860</S> saw<S>7200</S> me, and turned<S>5186</S> from me<S>6440</S> these three<S>7969</S> times<S>7272</S>: unless<S>194</S> she had turned<S>5186</S> from me<S>6440</S>, surely now also I had slain<S>2026</S> thee, and saved her alive<S>2421</S>.
And Balaam<S>1109</S> said<S>559</S> unto the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, I have sinned<S>2398</S>; for I knew<S>3045</S> not that thou stoodest<S>5324</S> in the way<S>1870</S> against<S>7125</S> me: now therefore, if it displease thee<S>7489</S> <S>5869</S>, I will get me back again<S>7725</S>. <sup>displease: Heb. be evil in thine eyes</sup>
And the angel<S>4397</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> said<S>559</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, Go<S>3212</S> with the men<S>582</S>: but only<S>657</S> the word<S>1697</S> that I shall speak<S>1696</S> unto thee, that thou shalt speak<S>1696</S>. So Balaam<S>1109</S> went<S>3212</S> with the princes<S>8269</S> of Balak<S>1111</S>.
And when Balak<S>1111</S> heard<S>8085</S> that Balaam<S>1109</S> was come<S>935</S>, he went out<S>3318</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him unto a city<S>5892</S> of Moab<S>4124</S>, which is in the border<S>1366</S> of Arnon<S>769</S>, which is in the utmost<S>7097</S> coast<S>1366</S>.
And Balak<S>1111</S> said<S>559</S> unto Balaam<S>1109</S>, Did I not earnestly<S>7971</S> send<S>7971</S> unto thee to call<S>7121</S> thee? wherefore camest<S>1980</S> thou not unto me? am I not able<S>3201</S> indeed<S>552</S> to promote thee to honour<S>3513</S>?
And Balaam<S>1109</S> said<S>559</S> unto Balak<S>1111</S>, Lo, I am come<S>935</S> unto thee: have I now any power<S>3201</S> at all<S>3201</S> to say<S>1696</S> any thing<S>3972</S>? the word<S>1697</S> that God<S>430</S> putteth<S>7760</S> in my mouth<S>6310</S>, that shall I speak<S>1696</S>.
And Balaam<S>1109</S> went<S>3212</S> with Balak<S>1111</S>, and they came<S>935</S> unto Kirjathhuzoth<S>2351</S> <S>7155</S>. <sup>Kirjathhuzoth: or, a city of streets</sup>
And Balak<S>1111</S> offered<S>2076</S> oxen<S>1241</S> and sheep<S>6629</S>, and sent<S>7971</S> to Balaam<S>1109</S>, and to the princes<S>8269</S> that were with him.
And it came to pass on the morrow<S>1242</S>, that Balak<S>1111</S> took<S>3947</S> Balaam<S>1109</S>, and brought him up<S>5927</S> into the high places<S>1116</S> of Baal<S>1120</S>, that thence he might see<S>7200</S> the utmost<S>7097</S> part of the people<S>5971</S>.

Hear<S>8085</S> ye this, O house<S>1004</S> of Jacob<S>3290</S>, which are called<S>7121</S> by the name<S>8034</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, and are come forth<S>3318</S> out of the waters<S>4325</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, which swear<S>7650</S> by the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and make mention<S>2142</S> of the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, but not in truth<S>571</S>, nor in righteousness<S>6666</S>.
For they call<S>7121</S> themselves of the holy<S>6944</S> city<S>5892</S>, and stay<S>5564</S> themselves upon the God<S>430</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; The LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> is his name<S>8034</S>.
I have declared<S>5046</S> the former things<S>7223</S> from the beginning<S>227</S>; and they went forth<S>3318</S> out of my mouth<S>6310</S>, and I shewed<S>8085</S> them; I did<S>6213</S> them suddenly<S>6597</S>, and they came to pass<S>935</S>.
Because I knew<S>1847</S> that thou art obstinate<S>7186</S>, and thy neck<S>6203</S> is an iron<S>1270</S> sinew<S>1517</S>, and thy brow<S>4696</S> brass<S>5154</S>; <sup>obstinate: Heb. hard</sup>
I have even from the beginning<S>227</S> declared<S>5046</S> it to thee; before it came to pass<S>935</S> I shewed<S>8085</S> it thee: lest thou shouldest say<S>559</S>, Mine idol<S>6090</S> hath done<S>6213</S> them, and my graven image<S>6459</S>, and my molten image<S>5262</S>, hath commanded<S>6680</S> them.
Thou hast heard<S>8085</S>, see<S>2372</S> all this; and will not ye declare<S>5046</S> it? I have shewed<S>8085</S> thee new things<S>2319</S> from this time<S>6258</S>, even hidden things<S>5341</S>, and thou didst not know<S>3045</S> them.
They are created<S>1254</S> now, and not from the beginning; even before<S>6440</S> the day<S>3117</S> when thou heardest<S>8085</S> them not; lest thou shouldest say<S>559</S>, Behold, I knew<S>3045</S> them.
Yea, thou heardest<S>8085</S> not; yea, thou knewest<S>3045</S> not; yea, from that time that thine ear<S>241</S> was not opened<S>6605</S>: for I knew<S>3045</S> that thou wouldest deal very<S>898</S> treacherously<S>898</S>, and wast called<S>7121</S> a transgressor<S>6586</S> from the womb<S>990</S>.
For my name's<S>8034</S> sake will I defer<S>748</S> mine anger<S>639</S>, and for my praise<S>8416</S> will I refrain<S>2413</S> for thee, that I cut thee not off<S>3772</S>.
Behold, I have refined<S>6884</S> thee, but not with silver<S>3701</S>; I have chosen<S>977</S> thee in the furnace<S>3564</S> of affliction<S>6040</S>. <sup>with: or, for silver</sup>
For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do<S>6213</S> it: for how should my name be polluted<S>2490</S>? and I will not give<S>5414</S> my glory<S>3519</S> unto another<S>312</S>.
Hearken<S>8085</S> unto me, O Jacob<S>3290</S> and Israel<S>3478</S>, my called<S>7121</S>; I am he; I am the first<S>7223</S>, I also am the last<S>314</S>.
Mine hand<S>3027</S> also hath laid the foundation<S>3245</S> of the earth<S>776</S>, and my right hand<S>3225</S> hath spanned<S>2946</S> the heavens<S>8064</S>: when I call<S>7121</S> unto them, they stand up<S>5975</S> together<S>3162</S>. <sup>my: or, the palm of my right hand hath spread out</sup>
All ye, assemble<S>6908</S> yourselves, and hear<S>8085</S>; which among them hath declared<S>5046</S> these things? The LORD<S>3068</S> hath loved<S>157</S> him: he will do<S>6213</S> his pleasure<S>2656</S> on Babylon<S>894</S>, and his arm<S>2220</S> shall be on the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>.
I, even I, have spoken<S>1696</S>; yea, I have called<S>7121</S> him: I have brought<S>935</S> him, and he shall make his way<S>1870</S> prosperous<S>6743</S>.
Come<S>7126</S> ye near<S>7126</S> unto me, hear<S>8085</S> ye this; I have not spoken<S>1696</S> in secret<S>5643</S> from the beginning<S>7218</S>; from the time<S>6256</S> that it was, there am I: and now the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>, and his Spirit<S>7307</S>, hath sent<S>7971</S> me.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, thy Redeemer<S>1350</S>, the Holy One<S>6918</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; I am the LORD<S>3068</S> thy God<S>430</S> which teacheth<S>3925</S> thee to profit<S>3276</S>, which leadeth<S>1869</S> thee by the way<S>1870</S> that thou shouldest go<S>3212</S>.
O that<S>3863</S> thou hadst hearkened<S>7181</S> to my commandments<S>4687</S>! then had thy peace<S>7965</S> been as a river<S>5104</S>, and thy righteousness<S>6666</S> as the waves<S>1530</S> of the sea<S>3220</S>:
Thy seed<S>2233</S> also had been as the sand<S>2344</S>, and the offspring<S>6631</S> of thy bowels<S>4578</S> like the gravel<S>4579</S> thereof; his name<S>8034</S> should not have been cut off<S>3772</S> nor destroyed<S>8045</S> from before<S>6440</S> me.
Go ye forth<S>3318</S> of Babylon<S>894</S>, flee<S>1272</S> ye from the Chaldeans<S>3778</S>, with a voice<S>6963</S> of singing<S>7440</S> declare<S>5046</S> ye, tell<S>8085</S> this, utter<S>3318</S> it even to the end<S>7097</S> of the earth<S>776</S>; say<S>559</S> ye, The LORD<S>3068</S> hath redeemed<S>1350</S> his servant<S>5650</S> Jacob<S>3290</S>.
And they thirsted<S>6770</S> not when he led<S>3212</S> them through the deserts<S>2723</S>: he caused the waters<S>4325</S> to flow<S>5140</S> out of the rock<S>6697</S> for them: he clave<S>1234</S> the rock<S>6697</S> also, and the waters<S>4325</S> gushed out<S>2100</S>.
There is no peace<S>7965</S>, saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, unto the wicked<S>7563</S>.

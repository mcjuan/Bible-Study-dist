Now Naaman<S>5283</S>, captain<S>8269</S> of the host<S>6635</S> of the king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S>, was a great<S>1419</S> man<S>376</S> with<S>6440</S> his master<S>113</S>, and honourable<S>5375</S>, because by him the LORD<S>3068</S> had given<S>5414</S> deliverance<S>8668</S> unto Syria<S>758</S>: he was also a mighty<S>1368</S> man<S>376</S> in valour<S>2428</S>, but he was a leper<S>6879</S>. <sup>with: Heb. before. honourable: or, gracious: Heb. lifted up, or, accepted in countenance. deliverance: or, victory</sup>
And the Syrians<S>758</S> had gone out<S>3318</S> by companies<S>1416</S>, and had brought away captive<S>7617</S> out of the land<S>776</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> a little<S>6996</S> maid<S>5291</S>; and she waited on<S>6440</S> Naaman's<S>5283</S> wife<S>802</S>. <sup>waited: Heb. was before</sup>
And she said<S>559</S> unto her mistress<S>1404</S>, Would<S>305</S> God my lord<S>113</S> were with<S>6440</S> the prophet<S>5030</S> that is in Samaria<S>8111</S>! for<S>227</S> he would recover<S>622</S> him of his leprosy<S>6883</S>. <sup>with: Heb. before</sup> <sup>recover: Heb. gather in</sup>
And one went in<S>935</S>, and told<S>5046</S> his lord<S>113</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Thus and thus said<S>1696</S> the maid<S>5291</S> that is of the land<S>776</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>.
And the king<S>4428</S> of Syria<S>758</S> said<S>559</S>, Go to<S>3212</S>, go<S>935</S>, and I will send<S>7971</S> a letter<S>5612</S> unto the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>. And he departed<S>3212</S>, and took<S>3947</S> with him<S>3027</S> ten<S>6235</S> talents<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and six<S>8337</S> thousand<S>505</S> pieces of gold<S>2091</S>, and ten<S>6235</S> changes<S>2487</S> of raiment<S>899</S>. <sup>with: Heb. in his hand</sup>
And he brought<S>935</S> the letter<S>5612</S> to the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Now when this letter<S>5612</S> is come<S>935</S> unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent<S>7971</S> Naaman<S>5283</S> my servant<S>5650</S> to thee, that thou mayest recover<S>622</S> him of his leprosy<S>6883</S>.
And it came to pass, when the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> had read<S>7121</S> the letter<S>5612</S>, that he rent<S>7167</S> his clothes<S>899</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Am I God<S>430</S>, to kill<S>4191</S> and to make alive<S>2421</S>, that this man<S>2088</S> doth send<S>7971</S> unto me to recover<S>622</S> a man<S>376</S> of his leprosy<S>6883</S>? wherefore<S>389</S> consider<S>3045</S>, I pray you, and see<S>7200</S> how he seeketh a quarrel<S>579</S> against me.
And it was so, when Elisha<S>477</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S> had heard<S>8085</S> that the king<S>4428</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> had rent<S>7167</S> his clothes<S>899</S>, that he sent<S>7971</S> to the king<S>4428</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Wherefore hast thou rent<S>7167</S> thy clothes<S>899</S>? let him come<S>935</S> now to me, and he shall know<S>3045</S> that there is<S>3426</S> a prophet<S>5030</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>.
So Naaman<S>5283</S> came<S>935</S> with his horses<S>5483</S> and with his chariot<S>7393</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> at the door<S>6607</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Elisha<S>477</S>.
And Elisha<S>477</S> sent<S>7971</S> a messenger<S>4397</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, Go<S>1980</S> and wash<S>7364</S> in Jordan<S>3383</S> seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S>, and thy flesh<S>1320</S> shall come again<S>7725</S> to thee, and thou shalt be clean<S>2891</S>.
But Naaman<S>5283</S> was wroth<S>7107</S>, and went away<S>3212</S>, and said<S>559</S>, Behold, I thought<S>559</S>, He will surely<S>3318</S> come out<S>3318</S> to me, and stand<S>5975</S>, and call<S>7121</S> on the name<S>8034</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> his God<S>430</S>, and strike<S>5130</S> his hand<S>3027</S> over the place<S>4725</S>, and recover<S>622</S> the leper<S>6879</S>. <sup>I thought: Heb. I said. or, I said with my self, He will surely come out, etc.</sup> <sup>strike: Heb. move up and down</sup>
Are not Abana<S>71</S> <S>549</S> and Pharpar<S>6554</S>, rivers<S>5104</S> of Damascus<S>1834</S>, better<S>2896</S> than all the waters<S>4325</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>? may I not wash<S>7364</S> in them, and be clean<S>2891</S>? So he turned<S>6437</S> and went away<S>3212</S> in a rage<S>2534</S>. <sup>Abana: or, Amana</sup>
And his servants<S>5650</S> came near<S>5066</S>, and spake<S>1696</S> unto him, and said<S>559</S>, My father<S>1</S>, if the prophet<S>5030</S> had bid<S>1696</S> thee do some great<S>1419</S> thing<S>1697</S>, wouldest thou not have done<S>6213</S> it? how much rather then<S>637</S>, when he saith<S>559</S> to thee, Wash<S>7364</S>, and be clean<S>2891</S>?
Then went he down<S>3381</S>, and dipped<S>2881</S> himself seven<S>7651</S> times<S>6471</S> in Jordan<S>3383</S>, according to the saying<S>1697</S> of the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>: and his flesh<S>1320</S> came again<S>7725</S> like unto the flesh<S>1320</S> of a little<S>6996</S> child<S>5288</S>, and he was clean<S>2891</S>.
And he returned<S>7725</S> to the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, he and all his company<S>4264</S>, and came<S>935</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> before<S>6440</S> him: and he said<S>559</S>, Behold, now I know<S>3045</S> that there is no God<S>430</S> in all the earth<S>776</S>, but in Israel<S>3478</S>: now therefore, I pray thee, take<S>3947</S> a blessing<S>1293</S> of thy servant<S>5650</S>.
But he said<S>559</S>, As the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, before<S>6440</S> whom I stand<S>5975</S>, I will receive<S>3947</S> none. And he urged<S>6484</S> him to take<S>3947</S> it; but he refused<S>3985</S>.
And Naaman<S>5283</S> said<S>559</S>, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given<S>5414</S> to thy servant<S>5650</S> two<S>6776</S> mules'<S>6505</S> burden<S>4853</S> of earth<S>127</S>? for thy servant<S>5650</S> will henceforth offer<S>6213</S> neither burnt offering<S>5930</S> nor sacrifice<S>2077</S> unto other<S>312</S> gods<S>430</S>, but unto the LORD<S>3068</S>.
In this thing<S>1697</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> pardon<S>5545</S> thy servant<S>5650</S>, that when my master<S>113</S> goeth<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S> to worship<S>7812</S> there, and he leaneth<S>8172</S> on my hand<S>3027</S>, and I bow<S>7812</S> myself in the house<S>1004</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S>: when I bow down<S>7812</S> myself in the house<S>1004</S> of Rimmon<S>7417</S>, the LORD<S>3068</S> pardon<S>5545</S> thy servant<S>5650</S> in this thing<S>1697</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Go<S>3212</S> in peace<S>7965</S>. So he departed<S>3212</S> from him a little<S>3530</S> way<S>776</S>. <sup>a little: Heb. a little piece of ground</sup>
But Gehazi<S>1522</S>, the servant<S>5288</S> of Elisha<S>477</S> the man<S>376</S> of God<S>430</S>, said<S>559</S>, Behold, my master<S>113</S> hath spared<S>2820</S> Naaman<S>5283</S> this Syrian<S>761</S>, in not receiving<S>3947</S> at his hands<S>3027</S> that which he brought<S>935</S>: but, as the LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>, I will run<S>7323</S> after<S>310</S> him, and take<S>3947</S> somewhat<S>3972</S> of him.
So Gehazi<S>1522</S> followed<S>7291</S> after<S>310</S> Naaman<S>5283</S>. And when Naaman<S>5283</S> saw<S>7200</S> him running<S>7323</S> after<S>310</S> him, he lighted down<S>5307</S> from the chariot<S>4818</S> to meet<S>7125</S> him, and said<S>559</S>, Is all well<S>7965</S>? <sup>Is: Heb. Is there peace?</sup>
And he said<S>559</S>, All is well<S>7965</S>. My master<S>113</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> me, saying<S>559</S>, Behold, even now there be come<S>935</S> to me from mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S> two<S>8147</S> young men<S>5288</S> of the sons<S>1121</S> of the prophets<S>5030</S>: give<S>5414</S> them, I pray thee, a talent<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S>, and two<S>8147</S> changes<S>2487</S> of garments<S>899</S>.
And Naaman<S>5283</S> said<S>559</S>, Be content<S>2974</S>, take<S>3947</S> two talents<S>3603</S>. And he urged<S>6555</S> him, and bound<S>6696</S> two<S>8147</S> talents<S>3603</S> of silver<S>3701</S> in two<S>8147</S> bags<S>2754</S>, with two<S>8147</S> changes<S>2487</S> of garments<S>899</S>, and laid<S>5414</S> them upon two<S>8147</S> of his servants<S>5288</S>; and they bare<S>5375</S> them before<S>6440</S> him.
And when he came<S>935</S> to the tower<S>6076</S>, he took<S>3947</S> them from their hand<S>3027</S>, and bestowed<S>6485</S> them in the house<S>1004</S>: and he let the men<S>582</S> go<S>7971</S>, and they departed<S>3212</S>. <sup>tower: or, secret place</sup>
But he went in<S>935</S>, and stood<S>5975</S> before his master<S>113</S>. And Elisha<S>477</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Whence<S>370</S> comest thou, Gehazi<S>1522</S>? And he said<S>559</S>, Thy servant<S>5650</S> went<S>1980</S> no whither<S>575</S>. <sup>no whither: Heb. not hither or thither</sup>
And he said<S>559</S> unto him, Went<S>1980</S> not mine heart<S>3820</S> with thee, when the man<S>376</S> turned<S>2015</S> again from his chariot<S>4818</S> to meet<S>7125</S> thee? Is it a time<S>6256</S> to receive<S>3947</S> money<S>3701</S>, and to receive<S>3947</S> garments<S>899</S>, and oliveyards<S>2132</S>, and vineyards<S>3754</S>, and sheep<S>6629</S>, and oxen<S>1241</S>, and menservants<S>5650</S>, and maidservants<S>8198</S>?
The leprosy<S>6883</S> therefore of Naaman<S>5283</S> shall cleave<S>1692</S> unto thee, and unto thy seed<S>2233</S> for ever<S>5769</S>. And he went out<S>3318</S> from his presence<S>6440</S> a leper<S>6879</S> as white as snow<S>7950</S>.

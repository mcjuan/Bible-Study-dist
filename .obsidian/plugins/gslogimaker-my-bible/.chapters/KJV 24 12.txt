Righteous<S>6662</S> art thou, O LORD<S>3068</S>, when I plead<S>7378</S> with thee: yet let me talk<S>1696</S> with thee of thy judgments<S>4941</S>: Wherefore doth the way<S>1870</S> of the wicked<S>7563</S> prosper<S>6743</S>? wherefore are all they happy<S>7951</S> that deal very<S>899</S> treacherously<S>898</S>? <sup>talk: or, reason the case with thee</sup>
Thou hast planted<S>5193</S> them, yea, they have taken root<S>8327</S>: they grow<S>3212</S>, yea, they bring forth<S>6213</S> fruit<S>6529</S>: thou art near<S>7138</S> in their mouth<S>6310</S>, and far from<S>7350</S> their reins<S>3629</S>. <sup>they grow: Heb. they go on</sup>
But thou, O LORD<S>3068</S>, knowest<S>3045</S> me: thou hast seen<S>7200</S> me, and tried<S>974</S> mine heart<S>3820</S> toward thee: pull them out<S>5423</S> like sheep<S>6629</S> for the slaughter<S>2878</S>, and prepare<S>6942</S> them for the day<S>3117</S> of slaughter<S>2028</S>. <sup>toward: Heb. with thee</sup>
How long shall the land<S>776</S> mourn<S>56</S>, and the herbs<S>6212</S> of every field<S>7704</S> wither<S>3001</S>, for the wickedness<S>7451</S> of them that dwell<S>3427</S> therein? the beasts<S>929</S> are consumed<S>5595</S>, and the birds<S>5775</S>; because they said<S>559</S>, He shall not see<S>7200</S> our last end<S>319</S>.
If thou hast run<S>7323</S> with the footmen<S>7273</S>, and they have wearied<S>3811</S> thee, then how canst thou contend<S>8474</S> with horses<S>5483</S>? and if in the land<S>776</S> of peace<S>7965</S>, wherein thou trustedst<S>982</S>, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do<S>6213</S> in the swelling<S>1347</S> of Jordan<S>3383</S>?
For even thy brethren<S>251</S>, and the house<S>1004</S> of thy father<S>1</S>, even they have dealt treacherously<S>898</S> with thee; yea, they have called<S>7121</S> a multitude<S>4392</S> after<S>310</S> thee: believe<S>539</S> them not, though they speak<S>1696</S> fair words<S>2896</S> unto thee. <sup>they have called: or, they cried after thee fully</sup> <sup>fair: Heb. good things</sup>
I have forsaken<S>5800</S> mine house<S>1004</S>, I have left<S>5203</S> mine heritage<S>5159</S>; I have given<S>5414</S> the dearly beloved<S>3033</S> of my soul<S>5315</S> into the hand<S>3709</S> of her enemies<S>341</S>. <sup>the dearly: Heb. the love</sup>
Mine heritage<S>5159</S> is unto me as a lion<S>738</S> in the forest<S>3293</S>; it crieth out<S>5414</S> <S>6963</S> against me: therefore have I hated<S>8130</S> it. <sup>crieth: or, yelleth: Heb. giveth out his voice</sup>
Mine heritage<S>5159</S> is unto me as a speckled<S>6641</S> bird<S>5861</S>, the birds<S>5861</S> round about<S>5439</S> are against her; come<S>3212</S> ye, assemble<S>622</S> all the beasts<S>2416</S> of the field<S>7704</S>, come<S>857</S> to devour<S>402</S>. <sup>speckled: or, taloned</sup> <sup>come to: or, cause them to come to</sup>
Many<S>7227</S> pastors<S>7462</S> have destroyed<S>7843</S> my vineyard<S>3754</S>, they have trodden<S>947</S> my portion<S>2513</S> under foot<S>947</S>, they have made<S>5414</S> my pleasant<S>2532</S> portion<S>2513</S> a desolate<S>8077</S> wilderness<S>4057</S>. <sup>pleasant: Heb. portion of desire</sup>
They have made<S>7760</S> it desolate<S>8076</S>, and being desolate<S>8077</S> it mourneth<S>56</S> unto me; the whole land<S>776</S> is made desolate<S>8074</S>, because no man<S>376</S> layeth<S>7760</S> it to heart<S>3820</S>.
The spoilers<S>7703</S> are come<S>935</S> upon all high places<S>8205</S> through the wilderness<S>4057</S>: for the sword<S>2719</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> shall devour<S>398</S> from the one end<S>7097</S> of the land<S>776</S> even to the other end<S>7097</S> of the land<S>776</S>: no flesh<S>1320</S> shall have peace<S>7965</S>.
They have sown<S>2232</S> wheat<S>2406</S>, but shall reap<S>7114</S> thorns<S>6975</S>: they have put themselves to pain<S>2470</S>, but shall not profit<S>3276</S>: and they shall be ashamed<S>954</S> of your revenues<S>8393</S> because of the fierce<S>2740</S> anger<S>639</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>they shall: or, ye shall</sup>
Thus saith<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> against all mine evil<S>7451</S> neighbours<S>7934</S>, that touch<S>5060</S> the inheritance<S>5159</S> which I have caused my people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S> to inherit<S>5157</S>; Behold, I will pluck them out<S>5428</S> of their land<S>127</S>, and pluck out<S>5428</S> the house<S>1004</S> of Judah<S>3063</S> from among<S>8432</S> them.
And it shall come to pass, after<S>310</S> that I have plucked them out<S>5428</S> I will return<S>7725</S>, and have compassion<S>7355</S> on them, and will bring them again<S>7725</S>, every man<S>376</S> to his heritage<S>5159</S>, and every man<S>376</S> to his land<S>776</S>.
And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently<S>3925</S> learn<S>3925</S> the ways<S>1870</S> of my people<S>5971</S>, to swear<S>7650</S> by my name<S>8034</S>, The LORD<S>3068</S> liveth<S>2416</S>; as they taught<S>3925</S> my people<S>5971</S> to swear<S>7650</S> by Baal<S>1168</S>; then shall they be built<S>1129</S> in the midst<S>8432</S> of my people<S>5971</S>.
But if they will not obey<S>8085</S>, I will utterly<S>5428</S> pluck up<S>5428</S> and destroy<S>6</S> that nation<S>1471</S>, saith<S>5002</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>.

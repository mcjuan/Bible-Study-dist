A Song<S>7892</S> of degrees<S>4609</S> of David<S>1732</S>. LORD<S>3068</S>, my heart<S>3820</S> is not haughty<S>1361</S>, nor mine eyes<S>5869</S> lofty<S>7311</S>: neither do I exercise<S>1980</S> myself in great matters<S>1419</S>, or in things too high<S>6381</S> for me. <sup>exercise: Heb. walk</sup> <sup>high: Heb. wonderful</sup>
Surely I have behaved<S>7737</S> and quieted<S>1826</S> myself<S>5315</S>, as a child that is weaned<S>1580</S> of his mother<S>517</S>: my soul<S>5315</S> is even as a weaned child<S>1580</S>. <sup>myself: Heb. my soul</sup>
Let Israel<S>3478</S> hope<S>3176</S> in the LORD<S>3068</S> from henceforth and for<S>5704</S> ever<S>5769</S>. <sup>henceforth: Heb. now</sup>

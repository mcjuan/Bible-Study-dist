And there was a man<S>376</S> of mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S>, whose name<S>8034</S> was Micah<S>4321</S>.
And he said<S>559</S> unto his mother<S>517</S>, The eleven hundred<S>505</S> <S>3967</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S> that were taken<S>3947</S> from thee, about which thou cursedst<S>422</S>, and spakest<S>559</S> of also in mine ears<S>241</S>, behold, the silver<S>3701</S> is with me; I took<S>3947</S> it. And his mother<S>517</S> said<S>559</S>, Blessed<S>1288</S> be thou of the LORD<S>3068</S>, my son<S>1121</S>.
And when he had restored<S>7725</S> the eleven hundred<S>505</S> <S>3967</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S> to his mother<S>517</S>, his mother<S>517</S> said<S>559</S>, I had wholly<S>6942</S> dedicated<S>6942</S> the silver<S>3701</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> from my hand<S>3027</S> for my son<S>1121</S>, to make<S>6213</S> a graven image<S>6459</S> and a molten image<S>4541</S>: now therefore I will restore<S>7725</S> it unto thee.
Yet he restored<S>7725</S> the money<S>3701</S> unto his mother<S>517</S>; and his mother<S>517</S> took<S>3947</S> two hundred<S>3967</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S>, and gave<S>5414</S> them to the founder<S>6884</S>, who made<S>6213</S> thereof a graven image<S>6459</S> and a molten image<S>4541</S>: and they were in the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4321</S>.
And the man<S>376</S> Micah<S>4318</S> had an house<S>1004</S> of gods<S>430</S>, and made<S>6213</S> an ephod<S>646</S>, and teraphim<S>8655</S>, and consecrated<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> one<S>259</S> of his sons<S>1121</S>, who became his priest<S>3548</S>. <sup>consecrated: Heb. filled the hand</sup>
In those days<S>3117</S> there was no king<S>4428</S> in Israel<S>3478</S>, but every man<S>376</S> did<S>6213</S> that which was right<S>3477</S> in his own eyes<S>5869</S>.
And there was a young man<S>5288</S> out of Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S> of the family<S>4940</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, who was a Levite<S>3881</S>, and he sojourned<S>1481</S> there.
And the man<S>376</S> departed<S>3212</S> out of the city<S>5892</S> from Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> where he could find<S>4672</S> a place: and he came<S>935</S> to mount<S>2022</S> Ephraim<S>669</S> to the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>, as he journeyed<S>6213</S> <S>1870</S>. <sup>as he: Heb. in making his way</sup>
And Micah<S>4318</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Whence<S>370</S> comest<S>935</S> thou? And he said<S>559</S> unto him, I am a Levite<S>3881</S> of Bethlehemjudah<S>1035</S> <S>3063</S>, and I go<S>1980</S> to sojourn<S>1481</S> where I may find<S>4672</S> a place.
And Micah<S>4318</S> said<S>559</S> unto him, Dwell<S>3427</S> with me, and be unto me a father<S>1</S> and a priest<S>3548</S>, and I will give<S>5414</S> thee ten<S>6235</S> shekels of silver<S>3701</S> by the year<S>3117</S>, and a suit<S>6187</S> of apparel<S>899</S>, and thy victuals<S>4241</S>. So the Levite<S>3881</S> went in<S>3212</S>. <sup>a suit: or, a double suit, etc: Heb. an order of garments</sup>
And the Levite<S>3881</S> was content<S>2974</S> to dwell<S>3427</S> with the man<S>376</S>; and the young man<S>5288</S> was unto him as one<S>259</S> of his sons<S>1121</S>.
And Micah<S>4318</S> consecrated<S>4390</S> <S>3027</S> the Levite<S>3881</S>; and the young man<S>5288</S> became his priest<S>3548</S>, and was in the house<S>1004</S> of Micah<S>4318</S>.
Then said<S>559</S> Micah<S>4318</S>, Now know<S>3045</S> I that the LORD<S>3068</S> will do me good<S>3190</S>, seeing I have a Levite<S>3881</S> to my priest<S>3548</S>.

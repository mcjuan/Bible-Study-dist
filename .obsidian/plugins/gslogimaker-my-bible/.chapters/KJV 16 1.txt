The words<S>1697</S> of Nehemiah<S>5166</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Hachaliah<S>2446</S>. And it came to pass in the month<S>2320</S> Chisleu<S>3691</S>, in the twentieth<S>6242</S> year<S>8141</S>, as I was in Shushan<S>7800</S> the palace<S>1002</S>,
That Hanani<S>2607</S>, one<S>259</S> of my brethren<S>251</S>, came<S>935</S>, he and certain men<S>582</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>; and I asked<S>7592</S> them concerning the Jews<S>3064</S> that had escaped<S>6413</S>, which were left<S>7604</S> of the captivity<S>7628</S>, and concerning Jerusalem<S>3389</S>.
And they said<S>559</S> unto me, The remnant<S>7604</S> that are left<S>7604</S> of the captivity<S>7628</S> there in the province<S>4082</S> are in great<S>1419</S> affliction<S>7451</S> and reproach<S>2781</S>: the wall<S>2346</S> of Jerusalem<S>3389</S> also is broken down<S>6555</S>, and the gates<S>8179</S> thereof are burned<S>3341</S> with fire<S>784</S>.
And it came to pass, when I heard<S>8085</S> these words<S>1697</S>, that I sat down<S>3427</S> and wept<S>1058</S>, and mourned<S>56</S> certain days<S>3117</S>, and fasted<S>6684</S>, and prayed<S>6419</S> before<S>6440</S> the God<S>430</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>,
And said<S>559</S>, I beseech<S>577</S> thee, O LORD<S>3068</S> God<S>430</S> of heaven<S>8064</S>, the great<S>1419</S> and terrible<S>3372</S> God<S>410</S>, that keepeth<S>8104</S> covenant<S>1285</S> and mercy<S>2617</S> for them that love<S>157</S> him and observe<S>8104</S> his commandments<S>4687</S>:
Let thine ear<S>241</S> now be attentive<S>7183</S>, and thine eyes<S>5869</S> open<S>6605</S>, that thou mayest hear<S>8085</S> the prayer<S>8605</S> of thy servant<S>5650</S>, which I pray<S>6419</S> before<S>6440</S> thee now<S>3117</S>, day<S>3119</S> and night<S>3915</S>, for the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> thy servants<S>5650</S>, and confess<S>3034</S> the sins<S>2403</S> of the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>, which we have sinned<S>2398</S> against thee: both I and my father's<S>1</S> house<S>1004</S> have sinned<S>2398</S>.
We have dealt very<S>2254</S> corruptly<S>2254</S> against thee, and have not kept<S>8104</S> the commandments<S>4687</S>, nor the statutes<S>2706</S>, nor the judgments<S>4941</S>, which thou commandedst<S>6680</S> thy servant<S>5650</S> Moses<S>4872</S>.
Remember<S>2142</S>, I beseech thee, the word<S>1697</S> that thou commandedst<S>6680</S> thy servant<S>5650</S> Moses<S>4872</S>, saying<S>559</S>, If ye transgress<S>4603</S>, I will scatter you abroad<S>6327</S> among the nations<S>5971</S>:
But if ye turn<S>7725</S> unto me, and keep<S>8104</S> my commandments<S>4687</S>, and do<S>6213</S> them; though there were of you cast out<S>5080</S> unto the uttermost part<S>7097</S> of the heaven<S>8064</S>, yet will I gather<S>6908</S> them from thence, and will bring<S>935</S> them unto the place<S>4725</S> that I have chosen<S>977</S> to set<S>7931</S> my name<S>8034</S> there.
Now these are thy servants<S>5650</S> and thy people<S>5971</S>, whom thou hast redeemed<S>6299</S> by thy great<S>1419</S> power<S>3581</S>, and by thy strong<S>2389</S> hand<S>3027</S>.
O Lord<S>136</S>, I beseech<S>577</S> thee, let now thine ear<S>241</S> be attentive<S>7183</S> to the prayer<S>8605</S> of thy servant<S>5650</S>, and to the prayer<S>8605</S> of thy servants<S>5650</S>, who desire<S>2655</S> to fear<S>3372</S> thy name<S>8034</S>: and prosper<S>6743</S>, I pray thee, thy servant<S>5650</S> this day<S>3117</S>, and grant<S>5414</S> him mercy<S>7356</S> in the sight<S>6440</S> of this man<S>376</S>. For I was the king's<S>4428</S> cupbearer<S>8248</S>.

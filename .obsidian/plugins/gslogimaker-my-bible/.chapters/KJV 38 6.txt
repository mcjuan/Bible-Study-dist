And I turned<S>7725</S>, and lifted up<S>5375</S> mine eyes<S>5869</S>, and looked<S>7200</S>, and, behold, there came<S>3318</S> four<S>702</S> chariots<S>4818</S> out<S>3318</S> from between two<S>8147</S> mountains<S>2022</S>; and the mountains<S>2022</S> were mountains<S>2022</S> of brass<S>5178</S>.
In the first<S>7223</S> chariot<S>4818</S> were red<S>122</S> horses<S>5483</S>; and in the second<S>8145</S> chariot<S>4818</S> black<S>7838</S> horses<S>5483</S>;
And in the third<S>7992</S> chariot<S>4818</S> white<S>3836</S> horses<S>5483</S>; and in the fourth<S>7243</S> chariot<S>4818</S> grisled<S>1261</S> and bay<S>554</S> horses<S>5483</S>. <sup>bay: or, strong</sup>
Then I answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto the angel<S>4397</S> that talked<S>1696</S> with me, What are these, my lord<S>113</S>?
And the angel<S>4397</S> answered<S>6030</S> and said<S>559</S> unto me, These are the four<S>702</S> spirits<S>7307</S> of the heavens<S>8064</S>, which go forth<S>3318</S> from standing<S>3320</S> before the Lord<S>113</S> of all the earth<S>776</S>. <sup>spirits: or, winds</sup>
The black<S>7838</S> horses<S>5483</S> which are therein go forth<S>3318</S> into the north<S>6828</S> country<S>776</S>; and the white<S>3836</S> go forth<S>3318</S> after<S>310</S> them; and the grisled<S>1261</S> go forth<S>3318</S> toward the south<S>8486</S> country<S>776</S>.
And the bay<S>554</S> went forth<S>3318</S>, and sought<S>1245</S> to go<S>3212</S> that they might walk to and fro<S>1980</S> through the earth<S>776</S>: and he said<S>559</S>, Get you hence<S>3212</S>, walk to and fro<S>1980</S> through the earth<S>776</S>. So they walked to and fro<S>1980</S> through the earth<S>776</S>.
Then cried<S>2199</S> he upon<S>853</S> me, and spake<S>1696</S> unto me, saying<S>559</S>, Behold<S>7200</S>, these that go<S>3318</S> toward the north<S>6828</S> country<S>776</S> have quieted<S>5117</S> my spirit<S>7307</S> in the north<S>6828</S> country<S>776</S>.
And the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Take<S>3947</S> of them of the captivity<S>1473</S>, even of Heldai<S>2469</S>, of Tobijah<S>2900</S>, and of Jedaiah<S>3048</S>, which are come<S>935</S> from Babylon<S>894</S>, and come<S>935</S> thou the same day<S>3117</S>, and go<S>935</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of Josiah<S>2977</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zephaniah<S>6846</S>;
Then take<S>3947</S> silver<S>3701</S> and gold<S>2091</S>, and make<S>6213</S> crowns<S>5850</S>, and set<S>7760</S> them upon the head<S>7218</S> of Joshua<S>3091</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Josedech<S>3087</S>, the high<S>1419</S> priest<S>3548</S>;
And speak<S>559</S> unto him, saying<S>559</S>, Thus speaketh<S>559</S> the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S>, saying<S>559</S>, Behold the man<S>376</S> whose name<S>8034</S> is The BRANCH<S>6780</S>; and he shall grow up<S>6779</S> out of his place, and he shall build<S>1129</S> the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: <sup>grow: or, branch up from under him</sup>
Even he shall build<S>1129</S> the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and he shall bear<S>5375</S> the glory<S>1935</S>, and shall sit<S>3427</S> and rule<S>4910</S> upon his throne<S>3678</S>; and he shall be a priest<S>3548</S> upon his throne<S>3678</S>: and the counsel<S>6098</S> of peace<S>7965</S> shall be between them both<S>8147</S>.
And the crowns<S>5850</S> shall be to Helem<S>2494</S>, and to Tobijah<S>2900</S>, and to Jedaiah<S>3048</S>, and to Hen<S>2581</S> the son<S>1121</S> of Zephaniah<S>6846</S>, for a memorial<S>2146</S> in the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And they that are far off<S>7350</S> shall come<S>935</S> and build<S>1129</S> in the temple<S>1964</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that the LORD<S>3068</S> of hosts<S>6635</S> hath sent<S>7971</S> me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently<S>8085</S> obey<S>8085</S> the voice<S>6963</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> your God<S>430</S>.

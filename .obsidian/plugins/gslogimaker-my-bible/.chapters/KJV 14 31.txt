Now when all this was finished<S>3615</S>, all Israel<S>3478</S> that were present<S>4672</S> went out<S>3318</S> to the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, and brake<S>7665</S> the images<S>4676</S> in pieces<S>7665</S>, and cut down<S>1438</S> the groves<S>842</S>, and threw down<S>5422</S> the high places<S>1116</S> and the altars<S>4196</S> out of all Judah<S>3063</S> and Benjamin<S>1144</S>, in Ephraim<S>669</S> also and Manasseh<S>4519</S>, until they had utterly destroyed<S>3615</S> them all. Then all the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> returned<S>7725</S>, every man<S>376</S> to his possession<S>272</S>, into their own cities<S>5892</S>. <sup>present: Heb. found</sup> <sup>images: Heb. statues</sup> <sup>until: Heb. until to make an end</sup>
And Hezekiah<S>3169</S> appointed<S>5975</S> the courses<S>4256</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S> after their courses<S>4256</S>, every man<S>376</S> according<S>6310</S> to his service<S>5656</S>, the priests<S>3548</S> and Levites<S>3881</S> for burnt offerings<S>5930</S> and for peace offerings<S>8002</S>, to minister<S>8334</S>, and to give thanks<S>3034</S>, and to praise<S>1984</S> in the gates<S>8179</S> of the tents<S>4264</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
He appointed also the king's<S>4428</S> portion<S>4521</S> of his substance<S>7399</S> for the burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, to wit, for the morning<S>1242</S> and evening<S>6153</S> burnt offerings<S>5930</S>, and the burnt offerings<S>5930</S> for the sabbaths<S>7676</S>, and for the new moons<S>2320</S>, and for the set feasts<S>4150</S>, as it is written<S>3789</S> in the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Moreover he commanded<S>559</S> the people<S>5971</S> that dwelt<S>3427</S> in Jerusalem<S>3389</S> to give<S>5414</S> the portion<S>4521</S> of the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S>, that they might be encouraged<S>2388</S> in the law<S>8451</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>.
And as soon as the commandment<S>1697</S> came abroad<S>6555</S>, the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> brought<S>935</S> in abundance<S>7235</S> the firstfruits<S>7225</S> of corn<S>1715</S>, wine<S>8492</S>, and oil<S>3323</S>, and honey<S>1706</S>, and of all the increase<S>8393</S> of the field<S>7704</S>; and the tithe<S>4643</S> of all things brought<S>935</S> they in abundantly<S>7230</S>. <sup>came: Heb. brake forth</sup> <sup>honey: or, dates</sup>
And concerning the children<S>1121</S> of Israel<S>3478</S> and Judah<S>3063</S>, that dwelt<S>3427</S> in the cities<S>5892</S> of Judah<S>3063</S>, they also brought in<S>935</S> the tithe<S>4643</S> of oxen<S>1241</S> and sheep<S>6629</S>, and the tithe<S>4643</S> of holy things<S>6944</S> which were consecrated<S>6942</S> unto the LORD<S>3068</S> their God<S>430</S>, and laid<S>5414</S> them by heaps<S>6194</S> <S>6194</S>. <sup>by heaps: Heb. heaps, heaps</sup>
In the third<S>7992</S> month<S>2320</S> they began<S>2490</S> to lay the foundation<S>3245</S> of the heaps<S>6194</S>, and finished<S>3615</S> them in the seventh<S>7637</S> month<S>2320</S>.
And when Hezekiah<S>3169</S> and the princes<S>8269</S> came<S>935</S> and saw<S>7200</S> the heaps<S>6194</S>, they blessed<S>1288</S> the LORD<S>3068</S>, and his people<S>5971</S> Israel<S>3478</S>.
Then Hezekiah<S>3169</S> questioned<S>1875</S> with the priests<S>3548</S> and the Levites<S>3881</S> concerning the heaps<S>6194</S>.
And Azariah<S>5838</S> the chief<S>7218</S> priest<S>3548</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of Zadok<S>6659</S> answered<S>559</S> him, and said<S>559</S>, Since the people began<S>2490</S> to bring<S>935</S> the offerings<S>8641</S> into the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>, we have had enough<S>7646</S> to eat<S>398</S>, and have left<S>3498</S> plenty<S>7230</S>: for the LORD<S>3068</S> hath blessed<S>1288</S> his people<S>5971</S>; and that which is left<S>3498</S> is this great store<S>1995</S>.
Then Hezekiah<S>3169</S> commanded<S>559</S> to prepare<S>3559</S> chambers<S>3957</S> in the house<S>1004</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>; and they prepared<S>3559</S> them, <sup>chambers: or, storehouses</sup>
And brought in<S>935</S> the offerings<S>8641</S> and the tithes<S>4643</S> and the dedicated<S>6944</S> things faithfully<S>530</S>: over which Cononiah<S>3562</S> the Levite<S>3881</S> was ruler<S>5057</S>, and Shimei<S>8096</S> his brother<S>251</S> was the next<S>4932</S>.
And Jehiel<S>3171</S>, and Azaziah<S>5812</S>, and Nahath<S>5184</S>, and Asahel<S>6214</S>, and Jerimoth<S>3406</S>, and Jozabad<S>3107</S>, and Eliel<S>447</S>, and Ismachiah<S>3253</S>, and Mahath<S>4287</S>, and Benaiah<S>1141</S>, were overseers<S>6496</S> under the hand<S>3027</S> of Cononiah<S>3562</S> and Shimei<S>8096</S> his brother<S>251</S>, at the commandment<S>4662</S> of Hezekiah<S>3169</S> the king<S>4428</S>, and Azariah<S>5838</S> the ruler<S>5057</S> of the house<S>1004</S> of God<S>430</S>. <sup>under: Heb. at the hand</sup>

A Prayer<S>8605</S> of David<S>1732</S>. Hear<S>8085</S> the right<S>6664</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, attend<S>7181</S> unto my cry<S>7440</S>, give ear<S>238</S> unto my prayer<S>8605</S>, that goeth not<S>3808</S> out of feigned<S>4820</S> lips<S>8193</S>. <sup>the right: Heb. justice</sup> <sup>not: Heb. without lips of deceit</sup>
Let my sentence<S>4941</S> come forth<S>3318</S> from thy presence<S>6440</S>; let thine eyes<S>5869</S> behold<S>2372</S> the things that are equal<S>4339</S>.
Thou hast proved<S>974</S> mine heart<S>3820</S>; thou hast visited<S>6485</S> me in the night<S>3915</S>; thou hast tried<S>6884</S> me, and shalt find<S>4672</S> nothing; I am purposed<S>2161</S> that my mouth<S>6310</S> shall not transgress<S>5674</S>.
Concerning the works<S>6468</S> of men<S>120</S>, by the word<S>1697</S> of thy lips<S>8193</S> I have kept<S>8104</S> me from the paths<S>734</S> of the destroyer<S>6530</S>.
Hold up<S>8551</S> my goings<S>838</S> in thy paths<S>4570</S>, that my footsteps<S>6471</S> slip<S>4131</S> not. <sup>slip: Heb. be not moved</sup>
I have called<S>7121</S> upon thee, for thou wilt hear<S>6030</S> me, O God<S>410</S>: incline<S>5186</S> thine ear<S>241</S> unto me, and hear<S>8085</S> my speech<S>565</S>.
Shew thy marvellous<S>6395</S> lovingkindness<S>2617</S>, O thou that savest<S>3467</S> by thy right hand<S>3225</S> them which put their trust<S>2620</S> in thee from those that rise up<S>6965</S> against them. <sup>by thy: or, them which trust in thee from those that rise up against thy right hand</sup>
Keep<S>8104</S> me as the apple<S>380</S> of the eye<S>1323</S> <S>5869</S>, hide<S>5641</S> me under the shadow<S>6738</S> of thy wings<S>3671</S>,
From<S>6440</S> the wicked<S>7563</S> that<S>2098</S> oppress<S>7703</S> me, from my deadly<S>5315</S> enemies<S>341</S>, who compass me about<S>5362</S>. <sup>oppress: Heb. waste</sup> <sup>my: Heb. my enemies against the soul</sup>
They are inclosed<S>5462</S> in their own fat<S>2459</S>: with their mouth<S>6310</S> they speak<S>1696</S> proudly<S>1348</S>.
They have now compassed<S>5437</S> us in our steps<S>838</S>: they have set<S>7896</S> their eyes<S>5869</S> bowing down<S>5186</S> to the earth<S>776</S>;
Like<S>1825</S> as a lion<S>738</S> that is greedy<S>3700</S> of his prey<S>2963</S>, and as it were a young lion<S>3715</S> lurking<S>3427</S> in secret places<S>4565</S>. <sup>Like: Heb. The likeness of him (that is, of every one of them) is as a lion that desireth to ravin</sup> <sup>lurking: Heb. sitting</sup>
Arise<S>6965</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, disappoint<S>6923</S> him<S>6440</S>, cast him down<S>3766</S>: deliver<S>6403</S> my soul<S>5315</S> from the wicked<S>7563</S>, which is thy sword<S>2719</S>: <sup>disappoint: Heb. prevent his face</sup> <sup>which is: or, by</sup>
From men<S>4962</S> which are thy hand<S>3027</S>, O LORD<S>3068</S>, from men<S>4962</S> of the world<S>2465</S>, which have their portion<S>2506</S> in this life<S>2416</S>, and whose belly<S>990</S> thou fillest<S>4390</S> with thy hid<S>6840</S> treasure: they are full<S>7646</S> of children<S>1121</S>, and leave<S>3240</S> the rest<S>3499</S> of their substance to their babes<S>5768</S>. <sup>which are: or, by</sup> <sup>they: or, their children are full</sup>
As for me, I will behold<S>2372</S> thy face<S>6440</S> in righteousness<S>6664</S>: I shall be satisfied<S>7646</S>, when I awake<S>6974</S>, with thy likeness<S>8544</S>.

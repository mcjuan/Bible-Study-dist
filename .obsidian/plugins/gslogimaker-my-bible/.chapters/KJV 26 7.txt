Moreover the word<S>1697</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S> came unto me, saying<S>559</S>,
Also, thou son<S>1121</S> of man<S>120</S>, thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S> unto the land<S>127</S> of Israel<S>3478</S>; An end<S>7093</S>, the end<S>7093</S> is come<S>935</S> upon the four<S>702</S> corners<S>3671</S> of the land<S>776</S>.
Now is the end<S>7093</S> come upon thee, and I will send<S>7971</S> mine anger<S>639</S> upon thee, and will judge<S>8199</S> thee according to thy ways<S>1870</S>, and will recompense<S>5414</S> upon thee all thine abominations<S>8441</S>. <sup>recompense: Heb. give</sup>
And mine eye<S>5869</S> shall not spare<S>2347</S> thee, neither will I have pity<S>2550</S>: but I will recompense<S>5414</S> thy ways<S>1870</S> upon thee, and thine abominations<S>8441</S> shall be in the midst<S>8432</S> of thee: and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>.
Thus saith<S>559</S> the Lord<S>136</S> GOD<S>3069</S>; An evil<S>7451</S>, an only<S>259</S> evil<S>7451</S>, behold, is come<S>935</S>.
An end<S>7093</S> is come<S>935</S>, the end<S>7093</S> is come<S>935</S>: it watcheth<S>6974</S> for thee; behold, it is come<S>935</S>. <sup>watcheth for: Heb. awaketh against</sup>
The morning<S>6843</S> is come<S>935</S> unto thee, O thou that dwellest<S>3427</S> in the land<S>776</S>: the time<S>6256</S> is come<S>935</S> <S>935</S>, the day<S>3117</S> of trouble<S>4103</S> is near<S>7138</S>, and not the sounding again<S>1906</S> of the mountains<S>2022</S>. <sup>sounding: or, echo</sup>
Now will I shortly<S>7138</S> pour out<S>8210</S> my fury<S>2534</S> upon thee, and accomplish<S>3615</S> mine anger<S>639</S> upon thee: and I will judge<S>8199</S> thee according to thy ways<S>1870</S>, and will recompense<S>5414</S> thee for all thine abominations<S>8441</S>.
And mine eye<S>5869</S> shall not spare<S>2347</S>, neither will I have pity<S>2550</S>: I will recompense<S>5414</S> thee according to thy ways<S>1870</S> and thine abominations<S>8441</S> that are in the midst<S>8432</S> of thee; and ye shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S> that smiteth<S>5221</S>. <sup>thee according: Heb. upon thee, etc</sup>
Behold the day<S>3117</S>, behold, it is come<S>935</S>: the morning<S>6843</S> is gone forth<S>3318</S>; the rod<S>4294</S> hath blossomed<S>6692</S>, pride<S>2087</S> hath budded<S>6524</S>.
Violence<S>2555</S> is risen up<S>6965</S> into a rod<S>4294</S> of wickedness<S>7562</S>: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude<S>1995</S>, nor of any<S>1991</S> of theirs: neither shall there be wailing<S>5089</S> for them. <sup>theirs: or, their tumultuous persons: Heb. tumult</sup>
The time<S>6256</S> is come<S>935</S>, the day<S>3117</S> draweth near<S>5060</S>: let not the buyer<S>7069</S> rejoice<S>8055</S>, nor the seller<S>4376</S> mourn<S>56</S>: for wrath<S>2740</S> is upon all the multitude<S>1995</S> thereof.
For the seller<S>4376</S> shall not return<S>7725</S> to that which is sold<S>4465</S>, although they were yet alive<S>2416</S>: for the vision<S>2377</S> is touching the whole multitude<S>1995</S> thereof, which shall not return<S>7725</S>; neither shall any<S>376</S> strengthen<S>2388</S> himself in the iniquity<S>5771</S> of his life<S>2416</S>. <sup>although they: Heb. though their life were yet among the living</sup> <sup>in the: or, whose life is in his iniquity</sup> <sup>the iniquity: Heb. his iniquity</sup>
They have blown<S>8628</S> the trumpet<S>8619</S>, even to make all ready<S>3559</S>; but none goeth<S>1980</S> to the battle<S>4421</S>: for my wrath<S>2740</S> is upon all the multitude<S>1995</S> thereof.
The sword<S>2719</S> is without<S>2351</S>, and the pestilence<S>1698</S> and the famine<S>7458</S> within<S>1004</S>: he that is in the field<S>7704</S> shall die<S>4191</S> with the sword<S>2719</S>; and he that is in the city<S>5892</S>, famine<S>7458</S> and pestilence<S>1698</S> shall devour<S>398</S> him.
But they that escape<S>6403</S> of them shall escape<S>6412</S>, and shall be on the mountains<S>2022</S> like doves<S>3123</S> of the valleys<S>1516</S>, all of them mourning<S>1993</S>, every one<S>376</S> for his iniquity<S>5771</S>.
All hands<S>3027</S> shall be feeble<S>7503</S>, and all knees<S>1290</S> shall be weak<S>3212</S> as water<S>4325</S>. <sup>be weak: Heb. go into water</sup>
They shall also gird<S>2296</S> themselves with sackcloth<S>8242</S>, and horror<S>6427</S> shall cover<S>3680</S> them; and shame<S>955</S> shall be upon all faces<S>6440</S>, and baldness<S>7144</S> upon all their heads<S>7218</S>.
They shall cast<S>7993</S> their silver<S>3701</S> in the streets<S>2351</S>, and their gold<S>2091</S> shall be removed<S>5079</S>: their silver<S>3701</S> and their gold<S>2091</S> shall not be able<S>3201</S> to deliver<S>5337</S> them in the day<S>3117</S> of the wrath<S>5678</S> of the LORD<S>3068</S>: they shall not satisfy<S>7646</S> their souls<S>5315</S>, neither fill<S>4390</S> their bowels<S>4578</S>: because it is the stumblingblock<S>4383</S> of their iniquity<S>5771</S>. <sup>removed: Heb. for a separation, or, uncleanness</sup> <sup>it is: or, their iniquity is their stumblingblock</sup>
As for the beauty<S>6643</S> of his ornament<S>5716</S>, he set<S>7760</S> it in majesty<S>1347</S>: but they made<S>6213</S> the images<S>6754</S> of their abominations<S>8441</S> and of their detestable things<S>8251</S> therein: therefore have I set<S>5414</S> it far<S>5079</S> from them. <sup>set it far: or, made it unto them an unclean thing</sup>
And I will give<S>5414</S> it into the hands<S>3027</S> of the strangers<S>2114</S> for a prey<S>957</S>, and to the wicked<S>7563</S> of the earth<S>776</S> for a spoil<S>7998</S>; and they shall pollute<S>2490</S> it.
My face<S>6440</S> will I turn<S>5437</S> also from them, and they shall pollute<S>2490</S> my secret<S>6845</S> place: for the robbers<S>6530</S> shall enter<S>935</S> into it, and defile<S>2490</S> it. <sup>robbers: or, burglers</sup>
Make<S>6213</S> a chain<S>7569</S>: for the land<S>776</S> is full<S>4390</S> of bloody<S>1818</S> crimes<S>4941</S>, and the city<S>5892</S> is full<S>4390</S> of violence<S>2555</S>.
Wherefore I will bring<S>935</S> the worst<S>7451</S> of the heathen<S>1471</S>, and they shall possess<S>3423</S> their houses<S>1004</S>: I will also make the pomp<S>1347</S> of the strong<S>5794</S> to cease<S>7673</S>; and their holy places<S>6942</S> shall be defiled<S>2490</S> <S>5157</S>. <sup>their holy: or, they shall inherit their holy places</sup>
Destruction<S>7089</S> cometh<S>935</S>; and they shall seek<S>1245</S> peace<S>7965</S>, and there shall be none. <sup>Destruction: Heb. Cutting off</sup>
Mischief<S>1943</S> shall come<S>935</S> upon mischief<S>1943</S>, and rumour<S>8052</S> shall be upon rumour<S>8052</S>; then shall they seek<S>1245</S> a vision<S>2377</S> of the prophet<S>5030</S>; but the law<S>8451</S> shall perish<S>6</S> from the priest<S>3548</S>, and counsel<S>6098</S> from the ancients<S>2205</S>.
The king<S>4428</S> shall mourn<S>56</S>, and the prince<S>5387</S> shall be clothed<S>3847</S> with desolation<S>8077</S>, and the hands<S>3027</S> of the people<S>5971</S> of the land<S>776</S> shall be troubled<S>926</S>: I will do<S>6213</S> unto them after their way<S>1870</S>, and according to their deserts<S>4941</S> will I judge<S>8199</S> them; and they shall know<S>3045</S> that I am the LORD<S>3068</S>. <sup>according: Heb. with their judgments</sup>

## A Little Foolishness
###### 1
Dead flies make the oil of the perfumer give off a foul odor; so a little foolishness {in one who is esteemed} outweighs wisdom and honor.  
###### 2
A wise man's heart *turns him* toward the right {which is the way of blessing}, but a fool's heart *turns him* toward the left {which is the way of condemnation}.  
###### 3
Even when a fool walks along the road, his {common} sense *and* good judgment fail him and he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool.  
###### 4
If the temper of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your post {showing resistance}, because composure *and* calmness prevent great offenses.
###### 5
There is an evil I have seen under the sun, like an error which proceeds from the ruler--  
###### 6
folly is set in many exalted places *and* in great dignity while the rich sit in humble places.  
###### 7
I have seen slaves *riding* on horses and princes walking like slaves on the ground.
###### 8
He who digs a pit {for others} may fall into it, and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a {stone} wall.  
###### 9
He who quarries stones may be hurt with them, and he who splits logs may be endangered by them.  
###### 10
If the axe is dull and he does not sharpen its edge, then he must exert more strength; but wisdom {to sharpen the axe} helps him succeed {with less effort}.  
###### 11
If the serpent bites before being charmed, then there is no profit for the charmer.  
###### 12
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious *and* win him favor, but the lips of a fool consume him;  
###### 13
the beginning of [^a]his talking is foolishness and the end of his talk is wicked madness.  
###### 14
Yet the fool multiplies words, though no man knows what will happen, and who can tell him what will come after he is gone?  
###### 15
The labor of a fool so wearies him {because he is ignorant} that he does not even know how to go to a city.  
###### 16
Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child and when your {incompetent} officials *and* princes feast in the morning.  
###### 17
Blessed {prosperous and admired} are you, O land, when your king is a man of noble birth, and your princes *and* officials feast at the proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness.  
###### 18
Through laziness the rafters {of state affairs} decay *and* the roof sags, and through idleness {the roof of} the house leaks.  
###### 19
*The officials* make a feast for enjoyment {instead of repairing what is broken}, and serve wine to make life merry, and money is the answer to everything.  
###### 20
Moreover, do not curse the king, even in your bedroom, and in your sleeping rooms do not curse the rich, for a bird of the air will carry the sound and a winged creature will make the matter known.

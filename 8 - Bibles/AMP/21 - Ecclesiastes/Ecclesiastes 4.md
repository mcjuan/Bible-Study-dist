## The Evils of Oppression
###### 1
Then I looked again *and* considered all the acts of oppression that were being practiced under the sun. And behold *I saw* the tears of the oppressed and they had no one to comfort them; and on the side of their oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.  
###### 2
So I congratulated *and* thought more fortunate are those who are already dead than the living who are still living.  
###### 3
But better off than either of them is the one who has not yet been born, who has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
###### 4
I have seen that every {effort in} labor and every skill in work *comes from* man's rivalry with his neighbor. This too is vanity (futility, false pride) and chasing after the wind.  
###### 5
The fool folds his hands {together} and consumes his own flesh {destroying himself by idleness and apathy}.  
###### 6
One hand full of rest *and* patience is better than two fists full of labor and chasing after the wind.
###### 7
Then I looked again at vanity under the sun {in one of its peculiar forms}.  
###### 8
There was a certain man--without a dependent, having neither a child nor a brother, yet there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches *and he never asked*, "For whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?" This too is vanity (a wisp of smoke, self-conceit); yes, it is a painful effort *and* an unhappy task.
###### 9
Two are better than one because they have a more satisfying return for their labor;  
###### 10
for if [^a]either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and does not have another to lift him up.  
###### 11
Again, if two lie down together, then they keep warm; but how can one be warm *alone*?  
###### 12
And though one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three *strands* is not quickly broken.
###### 13
A poor yet wise youth is better than an old and foolish king who [^b]no longer knows how to receive instruction *and* counsel (friendly reproof, warning)--  
###### 14
for the poor youth has {used his wisdom and} come out of prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.  
###### 15
I have seen all the living under the sun join with the second youth (the king's acknowledged successor) who replaces him.  
###### 16
There is no end to all the people; to all who were before them. Yet those who come later will not be happy with him. Surely this also is vanity (emptiness) and chasing after the wind.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Ecclesiastes 4:10 Lit *they fall*.
[^b]: Ecclesiastes 4:13 God’s word calls on us to make our senior years a time of spiritual maturity and intellectual growth. A time to convert a lifetime of courageous morality, personal integrity, and character-building into a legacy that encourages and inspires the next generation.

## The People's Apostasy Rebuked
###### 1
Hear this *and* pay close attention, O priests!  
Give heed, O house of Israel!  
Listen, O house of the king!  
For the {pronounced} judgment pertains to you *and* is meant for you to hear,  
Because you have been a snare at Mizpah  
And a net spread out over Tabor (military strongholds on either side of the Jordan River).  
###### 2
The revolters have gone deep into depravity,  
But I {the LORD God} will chastise them all.  
###### 3
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from Me;  
For now, O Ephraim, you have played the prostitute *and* have worshiped idols;  
Israel has defiled itself.  
###### 4
Their {immoral} practices will not permit them  
To return to their God,  
For the spirit of prostitution is within them  
And they do not know the LORD {they do not recognize, appreciate, heed or cherish Him}.  
###### 5
But the pride *and* self-reliance of Israel testifies against him.  
Therefore Israel, and {especially} [^a]Ephraim, stumble *and* fall in their wickedness *and* guilt;  
Judah[^b] also has stumbled with them.
###### 6
They will go with their flocks and with their herds  
To seek the LORD {diligently searching for Him}, but they will not find Him;  
He has withdrawn from them {refusing to hear the prayers of the unrepentant}.  
###### 7
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD,  
For they have borne illegitimate (pagan) children.  
Now the [^c]New Moon will devour them along with their land {bringing judgment and captivity}.
###### 8
Blow the horn in Gibeah,  
The trumpet in Ramah {the lofty hills on Benjamin's northern border}.  
Sound the alarm at Beth-aven:  
"Behind you *and* coming after you {is the enemy}, O Benjamin {be on guard}!"  
###### 9
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke;  
Among the tribes of Israel I declare what is certain.  
###### 10
The princes of Judah are like those who [^d]move a boundary *marker*;  
I will pour out My wrath on them like {an unrestrained flood of} water.  
###### 11
Ephraim is oppressed; he is broken *and* crushed by {divine} judgment,  
Because he was determined to follow *man's* command [^e](vanities, filth, secular precepts).  
###### 12
Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim  
And like dry rot to the house of Judah {in My judgment against them}.  
###### 13
When Ephraim saw his sickness,  
And Judah his wound,  
Then Ephraim went to Assyria {instead of the LORD}  
And sent to {Assyria's} great King Jareb {for help}.  
But he cannot heal you  
Nor will he cure you of your wound {received in judgment}.  
###### 14
For I *will be* like a lion to Ephraim  
And like a young lion to the house of Judah.  
I, even I, will tear to pieces and go on {tearing};  
I will carry off {the prey} and there will be no one to rescue *them*.  
###### 15
I will go away and return to My place {on high}  
Until they acknowledge their offense *and* bear their guilt and seek My face;  
In their distress they will earnestly seek Me, *saying*,

### Footnotes

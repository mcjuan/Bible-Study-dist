## Israel Reaps the Whirlwind
###### 1
Set the trumpet to your lips {announcing impending judgment}!  
Like a {great} vulture *the enemy comes* against the house of the LORD,  
Because they have broken My covenant  
And transgressed *and* rebelled against My law.  
###### 2
Then they will cry out to Me,  
"My God, we of Israel know You!"  
###### 3
Israel has rejected the good;  
The enemy shall pursue him.  
###### 4
They set up kings, but not from Me {therefore without My blessing};  
They have appointed princes, but I did not know it.  
With their silver and their gold they made idols for themselves,  
That they might be cut off.  
###### 5
He has rejected your {pagan} calf, O Samaria, *saying*,  
"My wrath burns against them."  
How long will they be incapable of innocence?  
###### 6
For even this {loathsome calf} is from Israel.  
A craftsman made it, so it is not God;  
Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces *and* go up in flames.  
###### 7
For they sow the wind {in evil}  
And they reap the whirlwind {in disaster}.  
The standing grain has no growth;  
It yields no grain.  
If it were to yield, strangers would swallow it up.
###### 8
Israel is {as if} swallowed up {by enemies};  
They are now among the nations  
Like a vessel {of cheap, coarse pottery} that is useless.  
###### 9
For they have gone up to Assyria,  
Like a wild donkey wandering alone *and* taking her own way;  
Ephraim has hired lovers (pagan allies).  
###### 10
Yes, even though {with presents} they hire *allies* among the nations,  
Now I will gather them up;  
And {in a little while} they will begin [^a]to grow weak *and* diminish  
Because of the burden imposed by the king of princes {the king of Assyria}.
###### 11
For Ephraim has constructed many altars for sin;  
They are altars intended for sinning {which multiply his guilt}.  
###### 12
I wrote for him the ten thousand *precepts* of My law,  
But they are regarded as a strange thing {which does not concern him}.  
###### 13
As for My sacrificial offerings,  
They sacrifice the meat {as a mere formality} and eat it,  
But the LORD is not pleased with them *and* does not accept them.  
Now He will remember *and* take into account their wickedness *and* guilt,  
And punish them for their sins.  
They will return {in captivity} to {another} Egypt {that is, Assyria}.  
###### 14
For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces {and pagan temples},  
And Judah has built many fortified cities;  
But I will send a fire upon their cities so that it may consume their palaces *and* fortresses.

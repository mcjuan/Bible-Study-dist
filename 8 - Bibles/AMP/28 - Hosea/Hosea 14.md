## Israel's Future Blessing
###### 1
O Israel, return {in repentance} to the LORD your God,  
For you have stumbled *and* fallen {visited by tragedy}, because of your sin.  
###### 2
Take the words {confessing your guilt} with you and return to the LORD.  
Say to Him, "Take away all our wickedness;  
Accept what is good *and* receive us graciously,  
So that we may present the fruit of our lips (gratitude).  
###### 3
"Assyria will not save us;  
We will not ride on horses {relying on military might},  
Nor will we say again to {the idols who are} the work of our hands,  
'You are our gods.'  
For in You {O LORD} the orphan finds love *and* compassion *and* mercy."
###### 4
I will heal their apostasy *and* faithlessness;  
I will love them freely,  
For My anger has turned away from Israel.  
###### 5
I shall be like the dew to Israel;  
He will blossom like the lily,  
And he will take root like *the cedars of* Lebanon.  
###### 6
His shoots will sprout,  
And his beauty will be like the olive tree  
And his fragrance like *the cedars of* Lebanon.  
###### 7
Those who live in his shadow  
Will again raise grain,  
And they will blossom like the vine.  
His renown *will be* like the wine of Lebanon.
###### 8
O Ephraim, what more have I to do with idols?  
It is I who have answered and will care for you *and* watch over you.  
I am like a luxuriant cypress tree;  
With Me your fruit is found {which is to nourish you}.
###### 9
Whoever is {spiritually} wise, let him understand these things;  
*Whoever* is {spiritually} discerning *and* understanding, let him know them.  
For the ways of the LORD are right,  
And the righteous will walk in them,  
But transgressors will stumble *and* fall in them.

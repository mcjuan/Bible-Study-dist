## The Response to God's Rebuke
###### 1
"Come and let us return {in repentance} to the LORD,  
For He has torn us, but He will heal us;  
He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.  
###### 2
"After two days He will revive us;  
On the third day He will raise us up  
That we may live before Him.  
###### 3
"So let us know *and* become personally acquainted with Him; let us press on to know *and* understand fully the {greatness of the} LORD {to honor, heed, and deeply cherish Him}.  
His appearing is prepared *and* is as certain as the dawn,  
And He will come to us {in salvation} like the {heavy} rain,  
Like the spring rain watering the earth."

## The Reply of the Lord
###### 4
O Ephraim, what shall I do with you?  
O Judah, what shall I do with you?  
For your {wavering} loyalty *and* kindness are {transient} like the morning cloud  
And like the dew that goes away early.  
###### 5
Therefore, I have hewn them in pieces by {the words of} the prophets;  
I have slain them by the words of My mouth;  
My judgments {pronounced upon them by the prophets} are like the light that shines forth {obvious to all}.  
###### 6
For I desire *and* delight in {steadfast} loyalty {faithfulness in the covenant relationship}, rather than sacrifice,  
And in the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.  
###### 7
But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant;  
There they have dealt treacherously against Me.  
###### 8
Gilead is a city of wrongdoers;  
It is tracked with bloody *footprints*.  
###### 9
And as bands of robbers {lie in} wait for a man,  
So a band of priests murder on the road toward [^a]Shechem {covering their crimes in that city of refuge};  
Certainly they have committed crimes *and* outrages.  
###### 10
I have seen a horrible thing {sins of every kind} in the house of Israel!  
Ephraim's prostitution (idolatry) is there; Israel has defiled itself.  
###### 11
Also, O Judah, there is a harvest {of divine judgment} appointed for you,  
When I restore the fortunes of My people {who have been slaves to the misery of sin}.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Hosea 6:9 Shechem was the first capital city of the Kingdom of Israel.

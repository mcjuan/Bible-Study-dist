## Ephraim Reminded
###### 1
Ephraim feeds on the {emptiness of the} wind  
And {continually} pursues the {parching} east wind {which brings destruction};  
Every day he multiplies lies and violence.  
Further, he makes a covenant with Assyria  
And (olive) oil is carried to Egypt {to seek alliances}.  
###### 2
The LORD also has a dispute {a legal complaint and an indictment} with Judah,  
And He will punish Jacob in accordance with his ways;  
He will repay him in accordance with his deeds.  
###### 3
In *their mother's* womb he took his brother by the heel,  
And in his maturity he contended with God.  
###### 4
He wrestled with the angel and prevailed;  
He wept {in repentance} and sought His favor.  
He met Him at Bethel  
And there God spoke with {him and through him with} us--  
###### 5
Even the LORD, the God of hosts,  
The name of Him {who spoke with Jacob} is the LORD.  
###### 6
Therefore, return {in repentance} to your God,  
Observe *and* highly regard kindness and justice,  
And wait {expectantly} for your God continually.  
###### 7
A merchant, in whose hand are false *and* fraudulent balances;  
He loves to oppress *and* exploit.  
###### 8
Ephraim said, "I have indeed become rich {and powerful as a nation};  
I have found wealth for myself.  
In all my labors they will not find in me  
Any wickedness that *would be* sin."  
###### 9
But I *have been* the LORD your God since {you became a nation in} the land of Egypt;  
I will make you live in tents again,  
As in the days of the appointed *and* solemn [^a]festival.  
###### 10
I have also spoken to {you through} the prophets,  
And I gave {them} many visions {to make My will known},  
And through the prophets I gave parables {to appeal to your sense of right and wrong}.  
###### 11
Is there wickedness (idolatry) in Gilead?  
Surely the people there are worthless.  
In Gilgal {they defy Me when} they sacrifice bulls,  
Yes, {after My judgment} their {pagan} altars are like the stone heaps  
In the furrows of the fields.
###### 12
Now Jacob (Israel) fled into the open country of Aram (Paddan-aram),  
And {there} Israel (Jacob) worked *and* served for a wife,  
And for a wife he kept *sheep*.  
###### 13
And by a prophet (Moses) the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt,  
And by a prophet Israel was preserved.  
###### 14
Ephraim has provoked most bitter anger;  
So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him {invoking punishment}  
And bring back to him his shame *and* dishonor.

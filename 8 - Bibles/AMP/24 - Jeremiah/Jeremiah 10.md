## A Satire on Idolatry
###### 1
Hear the word which the LORD speaks to you, O house of Israel.  
###### 2
Thus says the LORD,
"Do not learn the way of the {pagan} nations,  
And do not be terrified *and* distressed by the signs of the heavens  
Although the pagans are terrified by them;  
###### 3
For the customs *and* decrees of the peoples are {mere} delusion {exercises in futility};  
It is only wood which one cuts from the forest {to make a god},  
The work of the hands of the craftsman with the axe *or* cutting tool.  
###### 4
"They adorn the idol with silver and with gold;  
They fasten it with hammers and nails  
So that it will not fall apart.  
###### 5
"They are like scarecrows in a cucumber field;  
They cannot speak;  
They have to be carried,  
Because they cannot walk!  
Do not be afraid of them,  
For they can do no harm *or* evil,  
Nor can they do any good."
###### 6
There is none like You, O LORD;  
You are great, and great is Your mighty *and* powerful name.  
###### 7
Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?  
For it is appropriate *and* it is Your due!  
For among all the wise men of the nations  
And in all their kingdoms,  
There is none like You.  
###### 8
But they are altogether irrational *and* stupid and foolish  
*In their* discipline of delusion--their idol is {only} wood {it is ridiculous, empty and worthless}!  
###### 9
Silver *that has been* beaten {into plates} is brought from [^a]Tarshish,  
And gold from [^b]Uphaz,  
The work of the craftsman and of the hand of the goldsmith;  
Violet and purple are their clothing;  
They are all the work of skilled men.  
###### 10
But the LORD is the true God *and* the God who is Truth;  
He is the living God and the everlasting King.  
The earth quakes *and* shudders at His wrath,  
And the nations are not able to endure His indignation.
###### 11
In this manner you shall say to them, "The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens."
###### 12
God made the earth by His power;  
He established the world by His wisdom  
And by His understanding *and* skill He has stretched out the heavens.  
###### 13
When He utters His voice, *there is* a tumult of [^c]waters in the heavens,  
And He causes the clouds *and* the mist to ascend from the end of the earth;  
He makes lightning for the rain,  
And brings out the wind from His treasuries *and* from His storehouses.  
###### 14
Every man has become {like a brute} irrational *and* stupid, without knowledge {of God};  
Every goldsmith is shamed by his carved idols;  
For his molten images are frauds *and* lies,  
And there is no breath in them.  
###### 15
They are worthless *and* devoid of promise, a work of delusion *and* mockery;  
In their time of {trial and} punishment they will perish {without hope}.  
###### 16
The Portion of Jacob {the true God on whom Israel has a claim} is not like these;  
For He is the Designer *and* Maker of all things,  
And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance {and He will not fail them}--  
The LORD of hosts is His name.
###### 17
Gather up your bundle {of goods} from the ground,  
You who live under siege.  
###### 18
For thus says the LORD;  
"Behold, I am slinging out at this time the people of this land,  
And will cause them {great} distress,  
That they may find it {to be as I have said}."
###### 19
"Woe to me because of my {spiritual} brokenness!" {says Jeremiah, speaking for the nation.}  
"My wound is incurable."  
But I said, "Surely this sickness *and* suffering *and* grief are mine,  
And I must bear it."  
###### 20
My tent is destroyed,  
And all my {tent} cords are broken;  
My children have been taken from me {as captives} and are no more.  
There is no one to stretch out my tent again  
And to set up my {tent} curtains.  
###### 21
For the shepherds {of the people} have become {like brutes,} irrational *and* stupid,  
And have not searched for the LORD *or* asked about Him *or* realized their need for Him;  
Therefore they have not been wise *and* have not prospered,  
And all their flocks are scattered.  
###### 22
The sound of a report! Behold, {the invader} comes--  
A great commotion from the country of the north (Babylonia)--  
To make the cities of Judah  
A desolation, a haunt *and* dwelling place of jackals.
###### 23
O LORD, I know that the path of {life of} a man is not in himself;  
It is not within {the limited ability of} man {even one at his best} to choose *and* direct his steps {in life}.  
###### 24
O LORD, correct me {along with Your people}, but with mercy *and* in just measure--  
Not in Your anger, or You will crush me *and* bring me to nothing.  
###### 25
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know *nor* recognize You  
And on the families that do not call Your name.  
For they have devoured Jacob;  
They have devoured him and consumed him  
And made his land a desolate waste.

## Jeremiah's Prayer
###### 1
You, O LORD are {uncompromisingly} righteous *and* consistently just when I plead my case with You;  
Yet let me discuss issues of justice with You:  
Why has the way of the wicked prospered?  
Why are those who deal in treachery (deceit) at ease *and* thriving?  
###### 2
You have planted them, they have also taken root;  
They grow, they have even produced fruit.  
You are [^a]honored by their {hypocritical} lips  
But {You are} far from their heart *and* mind.  
###### 3
But You, O LORD, know me {and understand my devotion to You};  
You see me;  
And You examine *the attitude of* my heart toward You.  
Drag out the faithless like sheep for the slaughter {O LORD}  
And set them apart for the day of slaughter.  
###### 4
How long must the land mourn  
And the grass of the countryside wither?  
Because of the wickedness *and* hypocrisy of those who live in it,  
The beasts and the birds are consumed *and* are swept away {by the drought},  
Because men {mocking me} have said, "He will not {live long enough to} see {what happens at} our final end."
###### 5
{The LORD rebukes Jeremiah for his impatience, saying} "If you have raced with men on foot and they have tired you out,  
Then how can you compete with horses?  
If you fall down in a land of peace {where you feel secure},  
Then how will you do {among the lions} in the {flooded} thicket beside the Jordan?  
###### 6
"For even your {tribal} brothers and the household of your father,  
Even they have dealt treacherously (unfaithfully) with you;  
Indeed they are {like a pack of hounds} howling after you.  
Do not believe them, although they may say kind words *and* promise you good things."

## God's Answer
###### 7
"I have abandoned My house,  
I have given up My {precious} inheritance (Judah);  
I have given the {dearly} beloved of My life  
Into the hands of her enemies.  
###### 8
"My inheritance has become to Me  
Like a lion in the forest;  
She has raised her voice *and* roared against Me;  
So I have come to {treat her as if I} hate her.  
###### 9
"Is My inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to Me {unlike the others}?  
Are the birds of prey (enemies) surrounding her on every side?  
Go, gather all the {wild} beasts of the field;  
Bring them to devour {her}!  
###### 10
"Many shepherds (invaders) have destroyed My vineyard (Judah),  
They have trampled My field underfoot;  
They have made My pleasant field  
A desolate wilderness.  
###### 11
"They have made it a wasteland,  
Desolate, it mourns before Me;  
The whole land has been made a wasteland,  
Because no man takes it to heart.  
###### 12
"Destroyers have come  
On all the caravan roads in the desert,  
For the sword of the LORD (Babylon) is devouring  
From one end of the land even to the other;  
No one has peace *or* a way of escape.  
###### 13
"They have planted wheat but have reaped thorns;  
They have exhausted themselves but without profit.  
So be ashamed of your harvest  
Because of the fierce *and* raging anger of the LORD."
###### 14
Thus says the LORD regarding all My evil neighbors (Gentile nations) who strike at the inheritance which I have granted to My people Israel, "Behold, I will uproot them from their land and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.  
###### 15
And it shall come about that after I have uprooted them, I will return *and* have compassion on them; and I will bring them back again, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land.  
###### 16
And if these {neighboring nations} will diligently learn the ways of My people, to swear by My Name, saying, 'As the LORD lives'--even as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up among My people.  
###### 17
But if {any nation} will not listen *and* obey, I will {completely} uproot and destroy that nation, says the LORD."

## A Lament over Zion
###### 1
Oh that my head were waters  
And my eyes a fountain of tears,  
That I might weep day and night  
For the slain of the daughter of my people!  
###### 2
Oh that I had in the wilderness  
A lodging place (a mere shelter) for wayfaring men,  
That I might leave my people  
And go away from them!  
For they are all adulterers {worshiping idols instead of the LORD},  
{They are} an assembly of treacherous men {of weak character, men without integrity}.  
###### 3
"They bend their tongue like their bow;  
{Their} lies and not truth prevail *and* grow strong in the land;  
For they proceed from evil to evil,  
And they do not know *and* understand *and* acknowledge Me," says the LORD.  
###### 4
"Let everyone beware of his neighbor  
And do not trust any brother.  
For every brother is a supplanter {like Jacob, a deceiver, ready to grab his brother's heel},  
And every neighbor goes around as a slanderer.  
###### 5
"Everyone deceives *and* mocks his neighbor  
And does not speak the truth.  
They have taught their tongue to speak lies;  
They exhaust themselves with sin *and* cruelty.  
###### 6
"Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit {oppression upon oppression and deceit upon deceit};  
Through deceit they refuse to know (understand) Me," says the LORD.
###### 7
Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts,
"Behold, I will refine them {through suffering} and test them;  
For how else should I deal with the daughter of My people?  
###### 8
"Their tongue is a murderous arrow;  
It speaks deceit;  
With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor,  
But in his heart he lays traps *and* waits in ambush for him.  
###### 9
"Shall I not punish them for these things?" says the LORD.  
"Shall I not avenge Myself  
On such a nation as this?
###### 10
"I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains,  
And a {funeral} dirge for the pastures of the wilderness,  
Because they are burned up *and* desolated so that no one passes through {them};  
Nor can anyone hear the lowing of cattle.  
Both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled; they are gone.  
###### 11
"I will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins,  
A haunt *and* dwelling place of jackals;  
And I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant."
###### 12
Who is the wise man who may understand this {without any doubt}? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, so that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined, laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?  
###### 13
The LORD said, "Because they have [^a]turned away from My law which I set before them, and have not listened to *and* obeyed My voice nor walked in accordance with it,  
###### 14
but have walked stubbornly after their {own} heart and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them,"  
###### 15
therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, "behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood and give them bitter *and* poisonous water to drink.  
###### 16
I will {also} scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword after them until I have annihilated them."
###### 17
Thus says the LORD of hosts,
"Consider and call for the mourning women to come;  
Send for the wailing women to come.  
###### 18
"Let them hurry and take up a wailing for us,  
That our eyes may shed tears  
And our eyelids flow with water.  
###### 19
"For a sound of wailing is heard {coming} from Zion:  
'How we are ruined!  
We are greatly perplexed *and* utterly shamed,  
Because we have left the land,  
Because they have torn down our dwellings.'"  
###### 20
Now hear the word of the LORD, O you women,  
And let your ear hear the word of His mouth;  
Teach your daughters a song of mourning,  
And each one {teach} her neighbor a dirge.  
###### 21
For death has come up through our windows;  
It has entered our palaces,  
Cutting off the children from the streets  
And the young men from the town squares.  
###### 22
Speak, "Thus says the LORD,  
'The dead bodies of men will fall like dung on the open field,  
And like sheaves {of grain} behind the reaper,  
And no one will gather them.'"
###### 23
Thus says the LORD, "Let not the one who is wise *and* skillful boast in his insight; let not the one who is mighty *and* powerful boast in his strength; let not the one who is rich boast in his {temporal satisfactions and earthly} abundance;  
###### 24
but let the one who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows Me {and acknowledges Me and honors Me as God and recognizes without any doubt}, that I am the LORD who practices lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on the earth, for in these things I delight," says the LORD.
###### 25
"Behold, the days are coming," says the LORD, "when I will punish all who are circumcised {physically} and yet uncircumcised {spiritually}--  
###### 26
Egypt[^b] and Judah, and Edom and the sons of Ammon, and Moab and all those who live in the desert who clip off the hair on their temples; for all these nations are uncircumcised (sinful, impure), and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart."

## A Living Hope, and a Sure Salvation
###### 1
Peter, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ,
To those {elect--both Jewish and Gentile believers} who live as exiles, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia {Minor}, and Bithynia, who are chosen  
###### 2
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by the sanctifying work of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ and to be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace {that special sense of spiritual well-being} be yours in increasing abundance {as you walk closely with God}.
###### 3
Blessed {gratefully praised and adored} be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant *and* boundless mercy has caused us to be born again {that is, to be reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose} to an ever-living hope *and* confident assurance through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,  
###### 4
{born anew} into an inheritance which is imperishable {beyond the reach of change} and undefiled and unfading, reserved in heaven for you,  
###### 5
who are being protected *and* shielded by the power of God through *your* faith for salvation that is ready to be revealed {for you} in the last time.  
###### 6
In this you rejoice greatly, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,  
###### 7
so that the genuineness of your faith, which is much more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested *and* purified by fire, may be found to result in {your} praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.  
###### 8
Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; and though you do not even see Him now, you believe *and* trust in Him and you greatly rejoice *and* delight with inexpressible and glorious joy,  
###### 9
receiving as the result {the outcome, the consummation} of your faith, the salvation of [^a]your souls.
###### 10
Regarding this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace {of God} that *was intended for* you, searched carefully and inquired {about this future way of salvation},  
###### 11
seeking to find out what person or what time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He foretold the sufferings of Christ and the glories {destined} to follow.  
###### 12
It was revealed to them that their services {their prophecies regarding grace} were not {meant} for themselves *and* their time, but for you, in these things {the death, resurrection, and glorification of Jesus Christ} which have now been told to you by those who preached the gospel to you by the {power of the} Holy Spirit {who was} sent from heaven. Into these things even the angels long to look.
###### 13
So prepare your minds for action, be completely sober {in spirit--steadfast, self-disciplined, spiritually and morally alert}, fix your hope completely on the grace {of God} that is coming to you when Jesus Christ is revealed.  
###### 14
{Live} as obedient children {of God}; do not be conformed to the evil desires *which governed you* in your ignorance {before you knew the requirements and transforming power of the good news regarding salvation}.  
###### 15
But like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves in all *your* conduct {be set apart from the world by your godly character and moral courage};  
###### 16
because it is written, "You shall be holy (set apart), for I am holy."
###### 17
If you address as Father, the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in {reverent} fear {of Him} *and* with profound respect for Him throughout the time of your stay *on earth*.  
###### 18
For you know that you were not redeemed from your useless {spiritually unproductive} way of life inherited {by tradition} from your forefathers with perishable things like silver and gold,  
###### 19
but {you were actually purchased} with precious blood, like that of a {sacrificial} lamb unblemished and spotless, *the priceless blood* of Christ.  
###### 20
For He was [^b]foreordained (foreknown) before the foundation of the world, but has appeared {publicly} in these last times for your sake  
###### 21
and through Him you believe {confidently} in God {the heavenly Father}, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are {centered and rest} in God.
###### 22
Since by your obedience to the truth you have purified yourselves for a sincere love of the believers, {see that you} love one another from the heart {always unselfishly seeking the best for one another},  
###### 23
for you have been born again {that is, reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose} not of seed which is perishable but {from that which is} imperishable *and* immortal, *that is*, through the living and everlasting word of God.  
###### 24
For,
"All flesh is like grass,  
And all its glory like the flower of grass.  
The grass withers  
And the flower falls off,  
###### 25
But the word of the Lord endures forever."
And this is the word {the good news of salvation} which was preached to you.

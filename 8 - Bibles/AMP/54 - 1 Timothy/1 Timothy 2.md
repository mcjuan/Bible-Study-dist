## A Call to Prayer
###### 1
First of all, then, I urge that petitions (specific requests), prayers, intercessions (prayers for others) and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all people,  
###### 2
for [^a]kings and all who are in {positions of} high authority, so that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.  
###### 3
This {kind of praying} is good and acceptable *and* pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,  
###### 4
who [^b]wishes all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge *and* recognition of the {divine} truth.  
###### 5
For there is {only} one God, and {only} one Mediator between God and mankind, the Man Christ Jesus,  
###### 6
who gave Himself as a ransom {a substitutionary sacrifice to atone} for all, the testimony given at the right *and* proper time.  
###### 7
And for this matter I was appointed a preacher and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying {when I say this}--a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
###### 8
Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and disputing *or* quarreling *or* doubt {in their mind}.

## Women Instructed
###### 9
Likewise, *I want* women to adorn themselves modestly *and* appropriately and discreetly in proper clothing, not with {elaborately} braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothes,  
###### 10
but instead *adorned* by good deeds {helping others}, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.  
###### 11
A woman must quietly receive instruction with all submissiveness.  
###### 12
I do not allow a woman to [^c]teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet {in the congregation}.  
###### 13
For Adam was formed first {by God from the earth}, then Eve;  
###### 14
and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was led astray and [^d]fell into sin.  
###### 15
But *women* will be [^e]preserved (saved) through {the pain and dangers of} the bearing of children [^f]if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control *and* discretion.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 Timothy 2:2 Nero ruled as emperor of Rome at this time.
[^b]: 1 Timothy 2:4 Salvation is offered to everyone, but each individual must choose to accept or reject God’s gracious offer.
[^c]: 1 Timothy 2:12 The early church evidently followed Jewish practices in religious education. In Israel, mothers taught their daughters, and it was the father’s responsibility to teach his sons in all areas, including religious education. So Paul’s prohibitions here are consistent with the practices of his day.
[^d]: 1 Timothy 2:14 Lit *has come to be in*.
[^e]: 1 Timothy 2:15 This is considered one of the more difficult verses in the NT to interpret. Part of the difficulty is that the Greek verb rendered “preserved” is literally “saved,” which could refer either to physical preservation or to salvation. Some expositors interpret the verb as referring to the blessings of a woman’s role as wife and mother, especially in regard to raising godly children. However, the wording of the verse seen here reflects the interpretation that Paul is speaking, in broad terms, of protection from the dangers of childbirth.
[^f]: 1 Timothy 2:15 The blessings on a woman are the result of her adherence to the virtues listed.

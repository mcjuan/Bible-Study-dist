## Apostasy
###### 1
But the {Holy} Spirit explicitly *and* unmistakably declares that in later times some will turn away from the faith, paying attention instead to deceitful *and* seductive spirits and doctrines of demons,  
###### 2
{misled} by the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared as with a branding iron {leaving them incapable of ethical functioning},  
###### 3
who forbid marriage and *advocate* abstaining from {certain kinds of} foods which God has created to be gratefully shared by those who believe and have {a clear} knowledge of the truth.  
###### 4
For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude;  
###### 5
for it is sanctified {set apart, dedicated to God} by means of the word of God and prayer.

## A Good Minister's Discipline
###### 6
If you point out these instructions to the [^a]brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, *constantly* nourished {through study} on the words of the faith and of the good {Christian} doctrine which you have closely followed.  
###### 7
But have nothing to do with irreverent folklore *and* silly myths. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness {keeping yourself spiritually fit}.  
###### 8
For physical training is of some value, but godliness (spiritual training) is of value in everything *and* in every way, since it holds promise for the present life and for the life to come.  
###### 9
This is a faithful *and* trustworthy saying worthy of full acceptance *and* approval.  
###### 10
It is for this that we labor and strive {often called to account}, because we have fixed our {confident} hope on the living God, who is the [^b]Savior of all people, especially of those who believe {in Him, recognize Him as the Son of God, and accept Him as Savior and Lord}.
###### 11
Keep commanding and teaching these things.  
###### 12
Let no one look down on {you because of} your youth, but be an example *and* set a pattern for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in {moral} purity.  
###### 13
Until I come, devote yourself to public reading {of Scripture}, to preaching and to teaching {the sound doctrine of God's word}.  
###### 14
Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, {that special endowment} which was intentionally bestowed on you {by the Holy Spirit} through prophetic utterance when the [^c]elders laid their hands on you {at your ordination}.  
###### 15
Practice *and* work hard on these things; be absorbed in them {completely occupied in your ministry}, so that your progress will be evident to all.  
###### 16
Pay close attention to yourself {concentrate on your personal development} and to your teaching; persevere in these things {hold to them}, for as you do this you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.

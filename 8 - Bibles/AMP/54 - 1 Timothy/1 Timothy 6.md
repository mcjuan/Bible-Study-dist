## Instructions to Those Who Minister
###### 1
All who are under the yoke as bond-servants (slaves) are to regard their own masters as worthy of honor *and* respect so that the name of God and the teaching {about Him} will not be spoken against.  
###### 2
Those who have believing masters are not to be disrespectful toward them because they are brothers {in Christ}, but they should serve them even better, because those who benefit from their kindly service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these {duties and principles}.
###### 3
If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine *and* teaching which is in agreement with godliness (personal integrity, upright behavior),  
###### 4
he is conceited and woefully ignorant {understanding nothing}. He has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produces envy, quarrels, verbal abuse, evil suspicions,  
###### 5
and perpetual friction between men who are corrupted in mind and deprived of the truth, who think that godliness is a source of profit {a lucrative, money-making business--withdraw from them}.  
###### 6
But godliness *actually* is a source of great gain when accompanied by contentment {that contentment which comes from a sense of inner confidence based on the sufficiency of God}.  
###### 7
For we have brought nothing into the world, so {it is clear that} we cannot take anything out of it, either.  
###### 8
But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.  
###### 9
But those who {are not financially ethical and} crave to get rich {with a compulsive, greedy longing for wealth} fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction {leading to personal misery}.  
###### 10
For the love of money {that is, the greedy desire for it and the willingness to gain it unethically} is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves {through and through} with many sorrows.
###### 11
But as for you, [^a]O man of God, flee from these things; aim at *and* pursue righteousness {true goodness, moral conformity to the character of God}, godliness {the fear of God}, faith, love, steadfastness, and gentleness.  
###### 12
Fight the good fight of the faith {in the conflict with evil}; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and {for which} you made the good confession {of faith} in the presence of many witnesses.  
###### 13
I *solemnly* charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and {in the presence} of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession {in His testimony} before Pontius Pilate,  
###### 14
to keep all His precepts without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
###### 15
which He will bring about in His own time--He who is the blessed and only Sovereign {the absolute Ruler}, the King of those who reign as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords,  
###### 16
He alone possesses immortality {absolute exemption from death} and lives in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal power *and* dominion! Amen.
###### 17
As for the rich in this present world, instruct them not to be conceited *and* arrogant, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly *and* ceaselessly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.  
###### 18
*Instruct them* to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, willing to share {with others}.  
###### 19
In this way storing up for themselves the *enduring* riches of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
###### 20
O Timothy, guard *and* keep safe the deposit {of godly truth} entrusted to you, turn away from worldly and godless chatter {with its profane, empty words}, and the contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge"--  
###### 21
which some have professed and by doing so have erred (missed the mark) *and* strayed from the faith.
Grace be with you.

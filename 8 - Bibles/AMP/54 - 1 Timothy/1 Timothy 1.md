## Correcting False Teaching
###### 1
Paul, an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Christ Jesus by the commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed) our Hope {the fulfillment of our salvation},
###### 2
to Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace {inner calm and spiritual well-being} from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
###### 3
As I urged you when I was on my way to Macedonia, stay on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain individuals not to teach any different doctrines,  
###### 4
nor to pay attention to legends (fables, myths) and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation *and* meaningless arguments rather than advancing God's program *of instruction* which is grounded in faith {and requires surrendering the entire self to God in absolute trust and confidence}.  
###### 5
But the goal of our instruction is love {which springs} from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.  
###### 6
Some individuals have wandered away from these things into empty arguments *and* useless discussions,  
###### 7
wanting to be teachers of the Law {of Moses}, even though they do not understand the terms they use or the subjects about which they make {such} confident declarations.
###### 8
Now we know {without any doubt} that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully *and* appropriately,  
###### 9
understanding the fact that law is not enacted for the righteous person {the one in right standing with God}, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinful, for the irreverent and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,  
###### 10
for sexually immoral persons, for homosexuals, for [^a]kidnappers *and* slave traders, for liars, for perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,  
###### 11
according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
###### 12
I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has granted me {the needed} strength *and* made me able for this, because He considered me faithful *and* trustworthy, putting me into service {for this ministry},  
###### 13
even though I was formerly a blasphemer {of our Lord} and a persecutor {of His church} and a shameful *and* outrageous *and* violent aggressor {toward believers}. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted out of ignorance in unbelief.  
###### 14
The grace of our Lord {His amazing, unmerited favor and blessing} flowed out in superabundance {for me, together} with the faith and love which are {realized} in Christ Jesus.  
###### 15
This[^b] is a faithful *and* trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance *and* approval, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost.
###### 16
Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost {of sinners}, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example *or* pattern for those who [^c]would believe in Him for eternal life.  
###### 17
Now to the King of the ages {eternal}, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
###### 18
This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, so that {inspired and aided} by them you may fight the good fight {in contending with false teachers},  
###### 19
keeping your faith {leaning completely on God with absolute trust and confidence in His guidance} and having a good conscience; for some {people} have rejected {their moral compass} and have made a shipwreck of their faith.  
###### 20
Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have [^d]handed over to Satan, so that they will be disciplined *and* taught not to blaspheme.

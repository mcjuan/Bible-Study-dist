## Prayer for the Punishment of the Wicked.
###### 1
Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods (heavenly beings)?  
Do you judge fairly, O sons of men?  
###### 2
No, in your heart you devise wrongdoing;  
On earth you deal out the violence of your hands.  
###### 3
The wicked are estranged from the womb;  
These go astray from birth, speaking lies {even twisted partial truths}.  
###### 4
Their poison is like the venom of a serpent;  
They are like the deaf horned viper that stops up its ear,  
###### 5
So that it does not listen to the voice of charmers,  
Or of the skillful enchanter casting {cunning} spells.
###### 6
O God, break their teeth in their mouth;  
Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD.  
###### 7
Let them flow away like water that runs off;  
When he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts.  
###### 8
*Let them be* as a snail which melts away (secretes slime) as it goes along,  
Like the miscarriage of a woman which never sees the sun.  
###### 9
Before your cooking pots can feel the *fire of* thorns {burning under them as fuel},  
He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning ones alike.
###### 10
The {unyieldingly} righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance {of God};  
He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.  
###### 11
Men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous;  
Surely there is a God who judges on the earth."

## The Thirsting Soul Satisfied in God.
###### 1
O God, You are my God; with deepest longing I will seek You;  
My [^a]soul {my life, my very self} thirsts for You, my flesh longs *and* sighs for You,  
In a dry and weary land where there is no water.  
###### 2
So I have gazed upon You in the sanctuary,  
To see Your power and Your glory.  
###### 3
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life,  
My lips shall praise You.  
###### 4
So will I bless You as long as I live;  
I will lift up my hands in Your name.  
###### 5
My [^b]soul {my life, my very self} is satisfied as with marrow and fatness,  
And my mouth offers praises {to You} with joyful lips.
###### 6
When I remember You on my bed,  
I meditate *and* thoughtfully focus on You in the night watches,  
###### 7
For You have been my help,  
And in the shadow of Your wings {where I am always protected} I sing for joy.  
###### 8
My [^c]soul {my life, my very self} clings to You;  
Your right hand upholds me.
###### 9
But those who seek my life to destroy it  
Will {be destroyed and} go into the depths of the earth {into the underworld}.  
###### 10
They will be given over to the power of the sword;  
They will be a prey for foxes.  
###### 11
But the king will rejoice in God;  
Everyone who swears by Him {honoring the true God, acknowledging His authority and majesty} will glory,  
For the mouths of those who speak lies will be stopped.

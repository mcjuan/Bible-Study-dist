## Prayer for Mercy in Time of Trouble.
###### 1
O LORD, do not rebuke *or* punish me in Your anger,  
Nor discipline me in Your wrath.  
###### 2
Have mercy on me *and* be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am weak (faint, frail);  
Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed *and* anguished.  
###### 3
My soul {as well as my body} is greatly dismayed.  
But as for You, O LORD--how long {until You act on my behalf}?
###### 4
Return, O LORD, rescue my soul;  
Save me because of Your {unfailing} steadfast love *and* mercy.  
###### 5
For in death there is no mention of You;  
In Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) who will praise You *and* give You thanks?
###### 6
I am weary with my groaning;  
Every night I soak my bed with tears,  
I drench my couch with my weeping.  
###### 7
My eye grows dim with grief;  
It grows old because of all my enemies.
###### 8
Depart from me, all you who do evil,  
For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.  
###### 9
The LORD has heard my supplication {my plea for grace};  
The LORD receives my prayer.  
###### 10
Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly horrified;  
Let them turn back, let them suddenly be ashamed {of what they have done}.

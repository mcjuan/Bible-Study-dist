## Prayer for Victory over Enemies.
###### 1
May[^a] the LORD answer you (David) in the day of trouble!
May the name of the God of Jacob set you *securely* on high {and defend you in battle}!  
###### 2
May He send you help from the sanctuary (His dwelling place)  
And support *and* strengthen you from Zion!  
###### 3
May He remember all your meal offerings  
And accept your burnt offering. Selah.
###### 4
May He grant you your heart's desire  
And fulfill all your plans.  
###### 5
We will sing joyously over your victory,  
And in the name of our God we will set up our banners.  
May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.
###### 6
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed;  
He will answer him from His holy heaven  
With the saving strength of His right hand.  
###### 7
Some *trust* in chariots and some in horses,  
But we will remember *and* trust in the name of the LORD our God.  
###### 8
They have bowed down and fallen,  
But we have risen and stood upright.  
###### 9
O LORD, save {the [^b]king};  
May the [^c]King answer us in the day we call.

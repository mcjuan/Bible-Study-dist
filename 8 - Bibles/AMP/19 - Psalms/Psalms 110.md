## The LORD Gives Dominion to the King.
###### 1
The LORD (Father) says to my Lord (the Messiah, His Son),  
"Sit at My right hand  
Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet {subjugating them into complete submission}."  
###### 2
The LORD will send the scepter of Your strength from Zion, *saying*,  
"Rule in the midst of Your enemies."  
###### 3
Your people will offer themselves willingly {to participate in Your battle} in the day of Your power;  
In the splendor of holiness, from the womb of the dawn,  
Your young men are to You as the dew.
###### 4
The LORD has sworn {an oath} and will not change His mind:  
"[^a]You are a priest forever  
According to the order of Melchizedek."  
###### 5
The LORD is at Your right hand,  
He [^b]will crush kings in the day of His wrath.  
###### 6
He will execute judgment {in overwhelming punishment} among the nations;  
He will fill them with corpses,  
He will crush the chief men over a broad country.  
###### 7
He will drink from the brook by the wayside;  
Therefore He will lift up His head {triumphantly}.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 110:4 In rabbinic legend, Shem (the son of Noah) was Melchizedek, and God had planned to make him the first high priest. But when he blessed Abraham without first blessing God (Gen 14:18f), God gave the priesthood to Abraham instead.
[^b]: Psalm 110:5 Lit *has smashed*, probably a prophetic construction, and so in v 6.

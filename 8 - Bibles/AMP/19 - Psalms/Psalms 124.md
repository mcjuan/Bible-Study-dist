## Praise for Rescue from Enemies.
###### 1
"If it had not been the LORD who was on our side,"  
Let Israel now say,  
###### 2
"If it had not been the LORD who was on our side  
When men rose up against us,  
###### 3
Then they would have {quickly} swallowed us alive,  
When their wrath was kindled against us;  
###### 4
Then the waters would have engulfed us,  
The torrent would have swept over our soul;  
###### 5
Then the [^b]raging waters would have swept over our soul."
###### 6
Blessed be the LORD,  
Who has not given us as prey to be torn by their teeth.  
###### 7
We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers;  
The trap is broken and we have escaped.  
###### 8
Our help is in the name of the LORD,  
Who made heaven and earth.

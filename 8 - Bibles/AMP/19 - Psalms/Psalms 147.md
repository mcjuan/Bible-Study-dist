## Praise for Jerusalem's Restoration and Prosperity.
###### 1
Praise the LORD!  
For it is good to sing praises to our {gracious and majestic} God;  
Praise is becoming *and* appropriate.  
###### 2
The LORD is building up Jerusalem;  
He is gathering {together} the exiles of Israel.  
###### 3
He heals the brokenhearted  
And binds up their wounds {healing their pain and comforting their sorrow}.  
###### 4
He counts the number of the stars;  
He calls them all by their names.  
###### 5
Great is our {majestic and mighty} Lord and abundant in strength;  
His understanding is inexhaustible {infinite, boundless}.  
###### 6
The LORD lifts up the humble;  
He casts the wicked down to the ground.
###### 7
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving;  
Sing praises to our God with the lyre,  
###### 8
Who covers the heavens with clouds,  
Who provides rain for the earth,  
Who makes grass grow on the mountains.  
###### 9
He gives to the beast its food,  
And to the young ravens that for which they cry.  
###### 10
He does not delight in the strength (military power) of the horse,  
Nor does He take pleasure in the legs (strength) of a man.  
###### 11
The LORD favors those who fear *and* worship Him {with awe-inspired reverence and obedience},  
Those who wait for His mercy *and* lovingkindness.
###### 12
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem!  
Praise your God, O Zion!  
###### 13
For He has strengthened the bars of your gates,  
He has blessed your children within you.  
###### 14
He makes peace in your borders;  
He satisfies you with the finest of the wheat.  
###### 15
He sends His command to the earth;  
His word runs very swiftly.  
###### 16
He gives {to the earth} snow like {a blanket of} wool;  
He scatters the frost like ashes.  
###### 17
He casts out His ice like fragments;  
Who can stand before His cold?  
###### 18
He sends out His word and melts the ice;  
He causes His wind to blow and the waters to flow.  
###### 19
He declares His word to Jacob,  
His statutes and His ordinances to Israel.  
###### 20
He has not dealt this way with any {other} nation;  
They have not known {understood, appreciated, heeded, or cherished} His ordinances.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

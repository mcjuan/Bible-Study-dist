## A Prayer for Help, and Praise for Its Answer.
###### 1
To you I call, O LORD,  
My rock, do not be deaf to me,  
For if You are silent to me,  
I will become like those who go down to the pit (grave).  
###### 2
Hear the voice of my supplication (specific requests, humble entreaties) as I cry to You for help,  
As I lift up my hands *and* heart toward Your innermost sanctuary (Holy of Holies).  
###### 3
Do not drag me away with the wicked  
And with those who do evil,  
Who speak peace with their neighbors,  
While malice *and* mischief are in their hearts.  
###### 4
Repay them according to their work and according to the evil of their practices;  
Repay them according to the deeds of their hands;  
Repay them what they deserve.  
###### 5
Because they have no regard for the works of the LORD  
Nor the deeds of His hands,  
He will tear them down and not rebuild them.
###### 6
Blessed be the LORD,  
Because He has heard the voice of my supplication.  
###### 7
The LORD is my strength and my {impenetrable} shield;  
My heart trusts {with unwavering confidence} in Him, and I am helped;  
Therefore my heart greatly rejoices,  
And with my song I shall thank Him *and* praise Him.  
###### 8
The LORD is their {unyielding} strength,  
And He is the fortress of salvation to His anointed.  
###### 9
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance;  
Be their shepherd also, and carry them forever.

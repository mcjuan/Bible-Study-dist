## The End of the Wicked Contrasted with That of the Righteous.
###### 1
Truly God is good to Israel,  
To those who are pure in heart.  
###### 2
But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling,  
My steps had almost slipped.  
###### 3
For I was envious of the arrogant  
As I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  
###### 4
For there are no pains in their death,  
Their body is fat *and* pampered.  
###### 5
They are not in trouble *as other* men,  
Nor are they plagued like mankind.  
###### 6
Therefore pride is their necklace;  
Violence covers them like a garment {like a long, luxurious robe}.  
###### 7
Their eye bulges from fatness {they have more than the heart desires};  
The imaginations of their mind run riot {with foolishness}.  
###### 8
They mock and wickedly speak of oppression;  
They speak loftily {with malice}.  
###### 9
They set their mouth against the heavens,  
And their tongue swaggers through the earth.
###### 10
Therefore his people return to this place,  
And waters of abundance {offered by the irreverent} are {blindly} drunk by them.  
###### 11
They say, "How does God know?  
Is there knowledge {of us} with the Most High?"  
###### 12
Behold, these are the ungodly,  
Who always prosper *and* are at ease {in the world}; they have increased in wealth.  
###### 13
Surely then in vain I have cleansed my heart  
And washed my hands in innocence.  
###### 14
For all the day long have I been stricken,  
And punished every morning.
###### 15
If I had said, "I will say this," {and expressed my feelings},  
I would have betrayed the generation of Your children.  
###### 16
When I considered how to understand this,  
It was too great an effort for me *and* too painful  
###### 17
Until I came into the sanctuary of God;  
Then I understood {for I considered} their end.  
###### 18
Surely You set the wicked-minded *and* immoral on slippery places;  
You cast them down to destruction.  
###### 19
How they are destroyed in a moment!  
They are completely swept away by sudden terrors!  
###### 20
Like a dream {which seems real} until one awakens,  
O Lord, when stirred, {You observe the wicked}, You will despise their image.
###### 21
When my heart was embittered  
And I was pierced within {as with the fang of an adder},  
###### 22
Then I was senseless and ignorant;  
I was like a beast before You.  
###### 23
Nevertheless I am continually with You;  
You have taken hold of my right hand.  
###### 24
You will guide me with Your counsel,  
And afterward receive me to honor *and* glory.
###### 25
Whom have I in heaven {but You}?  
And besides You, I desire nothing on earth.  
###### 26
My flesh and my heart may fail,  
But God is the rock *and* strength of my heart and my portion forever.  
###### 27
For behold, those who are far from You will perish;  
You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful *and* have abandoned You.  
###### 28
But as for me, it is good for me to draw near to God;  
I have made the Lord God my refuge *and* placed my trust in Him,  
That I may tell of all Your works.

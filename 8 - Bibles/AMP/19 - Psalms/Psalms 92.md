## Praise for the Lord's Goodness.
###### 1
It is a good *and* delightful thing to give thanks to the LORD,  
To sing praises to Your name, O Most High,  
###### 2
To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning  
And Your faithfulness by night,  
###### 3
With an instrument of ten strings and with the harp,  
With a solemn sound on the lyre.  
###### 4
For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your works;  
At the works of Your hands I joyfully sing.
###### 5
How great are Your works, O LORD!  
Your thoughts are very deep {beyond man's understanding}.  
###### 6
A senseless man {in his crude and uncultivated state} knows nothing,  
Nor does a {self-righteous} fool understand this:  
###### 7
That though the wicked sprout up like grass  
And all evildoers flourish,  
They will be destroyed forever.  
###### 8
But You, LORD, are on high forever.  
###### 9
For behold, Your enemies, O LORD,  
For behold, Your enemies will perish;  
All who do evil will be scattered.
###### 10
But my horn {my emblem of strength and power} You have exalted like that of a wild ox;  
I am anointed with fresh oil {for Your service}.  
###### 11
My eye has looked on my foes;  
My ears hear of the evildoers who rise up against me.  
###### 12
The righteous will flourish like the date palm {long-lived, upright and useful};  
They will grow like a cedar in Lebanon {majestic and stable}.  
###### 13
Planted in the house of the LORD,  
They will flourish in the courts of our God.  
###### 14
{Growing in grace} they will still thrive *and* bear fruit *and* prosper in old age;  
They will flourish *and* be [^a]vital and fresh {rich in trust and love and contentment};  
###### 15
{They are living memorials} to declare that the LORD is upright *and* faithful {to His promises};  
He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.

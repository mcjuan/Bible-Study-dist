## The Beauty and Glory of Zion.
###### 1
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised,  
In the city of our God, His holy mountain.  
###### 2
Fair *and* beautiful in elevation, the joy of all the earth,  
Is Mount Zion {the City of David} in the far north,  
The city of the great King.  
###### 3
God, in her palaces,  
Has made Himself known as a stronghold.
###### 4
For, lo, the kings assembled themselves,  
They {came and} passed by together.  
###### 5
They saw it, then they were amazed;  
They were stricken with terror, they fled in alarm.  
###### 6
Panic seized them there,  
And pain, as that of a woman in childbirth.  
###### 7
With the east wind  
You shattered the ships of Tarshish.  
###### 8
As we have heard, so have we seen  
In the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God:  
God will establish her forever. Selah.
###### 9
We have thought of Your lovingkindness, O God,  
In the midst of Your temple.  
###### 10
As is Your name, O God,  
So is Your praise to the ends of the earth;  
Your right hand is full of righteousness (rightness, justice).  
###### 11
Let Mount Zion be glad,  
Let the daughters of Judah rejoice  
Because of Your {righteous} judgments.  
###### 12
Walk about Zion, go all around her;  
Count her towers,  
###### 13
Consider her ramparts,  
Go through her palaces,  
That you may tell the next generation {about her glory}.  
###### 14
For this is God,  
Our God forever and ever;  
He will be our guide even until death.

## Prayer in Time of Discipline.
###### 1
O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your wrath,  
Nor discipline me in Your burning anger.  
###### 2
For Your arrows have sunk into me *and* penetrate deeply,  
And Your hand has pressed down on me *and* greatly disciplined me.  
###### 3
There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your indignation;  
There is no health in my bones because of my sin.  
###### 4
For my iniquities have gone over my head {like the waves of a flood};  
As a heavy burden they weigh too much for me.  
###### 5
My wounds are loathsome and foul  
Because of my foolishness.  
###### 6
I am bent over and greatly bowed down;  
I go about mourning all day long.  
###### 7
For my sides are filled with burning,  
And there is no health in my flesh.  
###### 8
I am numb and greatly bruised {deadly cold and completely worn out};  
I groan because of the disquiet *and* moaning of my heart.
###### 9
Lord, all my desire is before You;  
And my sighing is not hidden from You.  
###### 10
My heart throbs violently, my strength fails me;  
And as for the light of my eyes, even that has also gone from me.  
###### 11
My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague;  
And my neighbors stand far away.  
###### 12
Those who seek my life lay snares *for me*,  
And those who seek to injure me threaten mischievous things *and* destruction;  
They devise treachery all the day long.
###### 13
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear;  
I am like a mute man who does not open his mouth.  
###### 14
Yes, I am like a man who does not hear,  
In whose mouth are no arguments.  
###### 15
For in You, O LORD, I hope;  
You will answer, O Lord my God.  
###### 16
For I pray, "May they not rejoice over me,  
Who, when my foot slips, would boast against me."  
###### 17
For I am ready to fall;  
My sorrow is continually before me.  
###### 18
For I do confess my guilt *and* iniquity;  
I am filled with anxiety because of my sin.  
###### 19
But my {numerous} enemies are vigorous and strong,  
And those who hate me without cause are many.  
###### 20
They repay evil for good, they attack *and* try to kill me,  
Because I follow what is good.  
###### 21
Do not abandon me, O LORD;  
O my God, do not be far from me.  
###### 22
Make haste to help me,  
O Lord, my Salvation.

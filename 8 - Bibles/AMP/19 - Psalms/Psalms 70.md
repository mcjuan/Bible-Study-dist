## Prayer for Help against Persecutors.
###### 1
O God, *come quickly* to save me;  
O LORD, come quickly to help me!  
###### 2
Let those be ashamed and humiliated  
Who seek my life;  
Let them be turned back and humiliated  
Who delight in my hurt.  
###### 3
Let them be turned back because of their shame *and* disgrace  
Who say, "Aha, aha!"
###### 4
May all those who seek You {as life's first priority} rejoice and be glad in You;  
May those who love Your salvation say continually,  
"Let God be magnified!"  
###### 5
But I am afflicted and needy;  
Come quickly to me, O God!  
You are my help and my rescuer;  
O LORD, do not delay.

## Israel Invoked to Praise the LORD.
###### 1
Praise the LORD!  
Sing to the LORD a new song,  
And praise Him in the congregation of His godly ones (believers).  
###### 2
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker;  
Let Zion's children rejoice in their King.  
###### 3
Let them praise His name with dancing;  
Let them sing praises to Him with the tambourine and lyre.  
###### 4
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people;  
He will beautify the humble with salvation.
###### 5
Let the godly ones exult in glory;  
Let them sing for joy on their beds.  
###### 6
Let the high praises of God be in their throats,  
And a two-edged sword in their hands,  
###### 7
To execute vengeance on the nations  
And punishment on the peoples,  
###### 8
To bind their kings with chains  
And their nobles with fetters of iron,  
###### 9
To execute on them the judgment written.  
This is the honor for all His godly ones.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

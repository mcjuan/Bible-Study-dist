## Thirsting for God in Trouble and Exile.
###### 1
As the deer pants {longingly} for the water brooks,  
So my [^a]soul pants {longingly} for You, O God.  
###### 2
My soul (my life, my inner self) thirsts for God, for the living God.  
When will I come and see the face of God?  
###### 3
My tears have been my food day and night,  
While they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"  
###### 4
These things I {vividly} remember as I pour out my soul;  
How I used to go along before the great crowd of people and lead them in procession to the house of God {like a choirmaster before his singers, timing the steps to the music and the chant of the song},  
With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a great crowd keeping a festival.
###### 5
Why are you in despair, O my soul?  
And why have you become restless *and* disturbed within me?  
Hope in God *and* wait expectantly for Him, for I shall again praise Him  
For the help of His presence.  
###### 6
O my God, my soul is in despair within me {the burden more than I can bear};  
Therefore I will {fervently} remember You from the land of the Jordan  
And the peaks of {Mount} Hermon, from Mount Mizar.  
###### 7
Deep calls to deep at the {thundering} sound of Your waterfalls;  
All Your breakers and Your waves have rolled over me.  
###### 8
Yet the LORD will command His lovingkindness in the daytime,  
And in the night His song will be with me,  
A prayer to the God of my life.
###### 9
I will say to God my rock, "Why have You forgotten me?  
Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"  
###### 10
As a crushing of my bones {with a sword}, my adversaries taunt me,  
While they say continually to me, "Where is your God?"  
###### 11
Why are you in despair, O my soul?  
Why have you become restless *and* disquieted within me?  
Hope in God *and* wait expectantly for Him, for I shall yet praise Him,  
The [^b]help of my countenance and my God.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 42:1 The Hebrew word translated “soul” in this psalm and elsewhere in the book of Psalms is *nephesh*. This word usually refers to a person’s “life” or “self,” but can also mean “throat,” as perhaps in vv 1, 2.
[^b]: Psalm 42:11 Or *saving acts of*.

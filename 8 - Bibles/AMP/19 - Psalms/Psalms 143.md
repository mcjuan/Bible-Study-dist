## Prayer for Help and Guidance.
###### 1
Hear my prayer, O LORD,  
Listen to my supplications!  
Answer me in Your faithfulness, and in Your righteousness.  
###### 2
And do not enter into judgment with Your servant,  
For in Your sight no man living is righteous *or* justified.  
###### 3
For the enemy has persecuted me,  
He has crushed my life down to the ground;  
He has made me dwell in dark places, like those who have been long dead.  
###### 4
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed *and* weak within me {wrapped in darkness};  
My heart grows numb within me.
###### 5
I remember the days of old;  
I meditate on all that You have done;  
I ponder the work of Your hands.  
###### 6
I reach out my hands to You;  
My throat *thirsts* for You, as a parched land {thirsts for water}. Selah.
###### 7
Answer me quickly, O LORD, my spirit fails;  
Do not hide Your face from me,  
Or I will become like those who go down into the pit (grave).  
###### 8
Let me hear Your lovingkindness in the morning,  
For I trust in You.  
Teach me the way in which I should walk,  
For I lift up my soul to You.  
###### 9
Rescue me, O LORD, from my enemies;  
I take refuge in You.
###### 10
Teach me to do Your will {so that I may please You},  
For You are my God;  
Let Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.  
###### 11
Save my life, O LORD, for Your name's sake;  
In Your righteousness bring my life out of trouble.  
###### 12
In your lovingkindness, silence *and* destroy my enemies  
And destroy all those who afflict my life,  
For I am Your servant.

## Hope in the Lord's Forgiving Love.
###### 1
Out of the [^b]depths {of distress} I have cried to You, O LORD.  
###### 2
Lord, hear my voice!  
Let Your ears be attentive  
To the voice of my supplications.  
###### 3
If You, LORD, should keep an account of our sins *and* treat us accordingly,  
O Lord, who could stand {before you in judgment and claim innocence}?  
###### 4
But there is forgiveness with You,  
That You may be feared *and* worshiped {with submissive wonder}.
###### 5
I wait {patiently} for the LORD, my soul {expectantly} waits,  
And in His word do I hope.  
###### 6
My soul waits for the Lord  
More than the watchmen for the morning;  
More than the watchmen for the morning.  
###### 7
O Israel, hope in the LORD;  
For with the LORD there is lovingkindness,  
And with Him is abundant redemption.  
###### 8
And He will redeem Israel  
From all his sins.

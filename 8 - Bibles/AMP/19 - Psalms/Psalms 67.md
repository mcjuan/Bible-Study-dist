## The Nations Exhorted to Praise God.
###### 1
God be gracious *and* kind-hearted to us and bless us,  
And make His face shine {with favor} on us-- Selah.  
###### 2
That Your way may be known on earth,  
Your salvation *and* deliverance among all nations.  
###### 3
Let the [^a]peoples praise You, O God;  
Let all the peoples praise You.  
###### 4
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy,  
For You will judge the people fairly  
And guide the nations on earth. Selah.  
###### 5
Let the peoples praise You, O God;  
Let all the peoples praise You.  
###### 6
The earth has yielded its harvest {as evidence of His approval};  
God, our God, blesses us.  
###### 7
God blesses us,  
And all the ends of the earth shall fear Him {with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder}.

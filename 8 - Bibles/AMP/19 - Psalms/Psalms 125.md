## The LORD Surrounds His People.
###### 1
Those who trust in *and* rely on the LORD {with confident expectation}  
Are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but remains forever.  
###### 2
As the mountains surround Jerusalem,  
So the LORD surrounds His people  
From this time forth and forever.  
###### 3
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land of the righteous,  
So that the righteous will not reach out their hands to do wrong.
###### 4
Do good, O LORD, to those who are good  
And to those who are upright in their hearts.  
###### 5
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways {in unresponsiveness to God},  
The LORD will lead them away with those who do evil.  
Peace be upon Israel.

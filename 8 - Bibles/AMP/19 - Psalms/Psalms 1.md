## The Righteous and the Wicked Contrasted.
###### 1
Blessed[^a] {fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God} is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked {following their advice and example},
Nor stand in the path of sinners,  
Nor sit {down to rest} in the seat of [^b]scoffers (ridiculers).  
###### 2
But his delight is in the law of the LORD,  
And on His law {His precepts and teachings} he {habitually} meditates day and night.  
###### 3
And he will be like a tree *firmly* planted {and fed} by streams of water,  
Which yields its fruit in its season;  
Its leaf does not wither;  
And in whatever he does, he prospers {and comes to maturity}.
###### 4
The wicked {those who live in disobedience to God's law} are not so,  
But they are like the chaff {worthless and without substance} which the wind blows away.  
###### 5
Therefore the wicked will not stand {unpunished} in the judgment,  
Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.  
###### 6
For the LORD knows *and* fully approves the way of the righteous,  
But the way of the wicked shall perish.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 1:1 This has been called “The Preface Psalm” because in some respects it introduces the complete book of Psalms as a godly message. It opens with a benediction, “Blessed,” as does the Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5:3).
[^b]: Psalm 1:1 I.e. shallow thinkers who are quick to mock or disdain.

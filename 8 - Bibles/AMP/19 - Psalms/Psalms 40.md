## God Sustains His Servant.
###### 1
I waited patiently *and* expectantly for the LORD;  
And He inclined to me and heard my cry.  
###### 2
He brought me up out of a horrible pit {of tumult and of destruction}, out of the miry clay,  
And He set my feet upon a rock, steadying my footsteps *and* establishing my path.  
###### 3
He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God;  
Many will see and fear {with great reverence}  
And will trust confidently in the LORD.
###### 4
Blessed {fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God} is the man who makes the LORD his trust,  
And does not regard the proud nor those who lapse into lies.  
###### 5
Many, O LORD my God, are the wonderful works which You have done,  
And Your thoughts toward us;  
There is none to compare with You.  
If I would declare and speak of *your wonders*,  
They would be too many to count.
###### 6
Sacrifice and meal offering You do not desire, *nor* do You delight in them;  
You have opened my ears *and* given me the capacity to hear {and obey Your word};  
Burnt offerings and sin offerings You do not require.  
###### 7
Then I said, "Behold, I come {to the throne};  
In the scroll of the book it is written of me.  
###### 8
"I delight to do Your will, O my God;  
Your law is within my heart."
###### 9
I have proclaimed good news of righteousness {and the joy that comes from obedience to You} in the great assembly;  
Behold, I will not restrain my lips {from proclaiming Your righteousness},  
As You know, O LORD.  
###### 10
I have not concealed Your righteousness within my heart;  
I have proclaimed Your faithfulness and Your salvation.  
I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth from the great assembly.
###### 11
Do not withhold Your compassion *and* tender mercy from me, O LORD;  
Your lovingkindness and Your truth will continually preserve me.  
###### 12
For innumerable evils have encompassed me;  
My sins have overtaken me, so that I am not able to see.  
They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,  
And my heart has failed me.
###### 13
Be pleased, O LORD, to save me;  
O LORD, make haste to help me.  
###### 14
Let those be ashamed and humiliated together  
Who seek my life to destroy it;  
Let those be turned back {in defeat} and dishonored  
Who delight in my hurt.  
###### 15
Let those be appalled *and* desolate because of their shame  
Who say to me, "Aha, aha {rejoicing in my misfortune}!"  
###### 16
Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;  
Let those who love Your salvation say continually,  
"The LORD be magnified!"  
###### 17
Even though I am afflicted and needy,  
Still the Lord takes thought *and* is mindful of me.  
You are my help and my rescuer.  
O my God, do not delay.

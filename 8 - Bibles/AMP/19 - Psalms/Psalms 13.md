## Prayer for Help in Trouble.
###### 1
How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever?  
How long will You hide Your face from me?  
###### 2
How long must I take counsel in my soul,  
*Having* sorrow in my heart day after day?  
How long will my enemy exalt himself *and* triumph over me?
###### 3
Consider and answer me, O LORD my God;  
Give light (life) to my eyes, or I will sleep the *sleep of* death,  
###### 4
And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him,"  
And my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken.
###### 5
But I have trusted *and* relied on *and* been confident in Your lovingkindness *and* faithfulness;  
My heart shall rejoice *and* delight in Your salvation.  
###### 6
I will sing to the LORD,  
Because He has dealt bountifully with me.

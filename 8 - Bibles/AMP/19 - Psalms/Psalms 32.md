## Blessedness of Forgiveness and of Trust in God.
###### 1
Blessed {fortunate, prosperous, favored by God} is he whose transgression is forgiven,  
And whose sin is covered.  
###### 2
Blessed is the man to whom the LORD does not impute wickedness,  
And in whose spirit there is no deceit.
###### 3
When I kept silent *about my sin*, my body wasted away  
Through my groaning all the day long.  
###### 4
For day and night Your hand {of displeasure} was heavy upon me;  
My [^b]energy (vitality, strength) was drained away as with the burning heat of summer. Selah.  
###### 5
I acknowledged my sin to You,  
And I did not hide my wickedness;  
I said, "I will confess {all} my transgressions to the LORD";  
And You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah.  
###### 6
Therefore, let everyone who is godly pray to You {for forgiveness} in a time when You {are near and} may be found;  
Surely when the great waters {of trial and distressing times} overflow they will not reach {the spirit in} him.  
###### 7
You are my hiding place; You, LORD, protect me from trouble;  
You surround me with songs *and* shouts of deliverance. Selah.
###### 8
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;  
I will counsel you {who are willing to learn} with My eye upon you.  
###### 9
Do not be like the horse or like the mule which have no understanding,  
Whose trappings include bridle and rein to hold them in check,  
*Otherwise* they will not come near to you.  
###### 10
Many are the sorrows of the wicked,  
But he who trusts in *and* relies on the LORD shall be surrounded with compassion *and* lovingkindness.  
###### 11
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, you righteous {who actively seek right standing with Him};  
Shout for joy, all you upright in heart.

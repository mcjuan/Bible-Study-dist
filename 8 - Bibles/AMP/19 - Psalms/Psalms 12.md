## God, a Helper against the Treacherous.
###### 1
Save *and* help *and* rescue, LORD, for godly people cease to be,  
For the faithful vanish from among the sons of men.  
###### 2
They speak deceitful *and* worthless words to one another;  
With flattering lips and a double heart they speak.  
###### 3
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,  
The tongue that speaks great things {in boasting};  
###### 4
Who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail;  
Our lips are our own; who is lord *and* master over us?"  
###### 5
"Because of the devastation of the afflicted, because of the groaning of the needy,  
Now I will arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs."
###### 6
The words *and* promises of the LORD are pure words,  
Like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times.  
###### 7
You, O LORD, will preserve *and* keep them;  
You will protect him from this {evil} generation forever.  
###### 8
The wicked strut about {in pompous self-importance} on every side,  
As vileness is exalted *and* baseness is prized among the sons of men.

## The LORD the Keeper of Israel.
###### 1
I will lift up my eyes to the hills {of Jerusalem}--  
From where shall my help come?  
###### 2
My help comes from the LORD,  
Who made heaven and earth.  
###### 3
He will not allow your foot to slip;  
He who keeps you will not slumber.  
###### 4
Behold, He who keeps Israel  
Will neither slumber {briefly} nor sleep {soundly}.
###### 5
The LORD is your keeper;  
The LORD is your shade on your right hand.  
###### 6
The sun will not strike you by day,  
Nor the moon by night.  
###### 7
The LORD will protect you from all evil;  
He will keep your life.  
###### 8
The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in {everything that you do}  
From this time forth and forever.

## Futility of Boastful Wickedness.
###### 1
Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man?  
The lovingkindness of God *endures* all day long.  
###### 2
Your tongue devises destruction,  
Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.  
###### 3
You love evil more than good,  
And falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah.  
###### 4
You love all words that devour,  
O deceitful tongue.
###### 5
But God will break you down forever;  
He will take you away and tear you away from your tent,  
And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah.  
###### 6
The righteous will see it and fear,  
And will {scoffingly} laugh, *saying*,  
###### 7
"Look, {this is} the man who would not make God his strength {his stronghold and fortress},  
But trusted in the abundance of his riches,  
Taking refuge in his wealth."
###### 8
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God;  
I trust {confidently} in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever.  
###### 9
I will thank You forever, because You have done it, {You have rescued me and kept me safe}.  
I will wait on Your name, for it is good, in the presence of Your godly ones.

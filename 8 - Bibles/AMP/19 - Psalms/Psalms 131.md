## Childlike Trust in the LORD.
###### 1
LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty;  
Nor do I involve myself in great matters,  
Or in things too difficult for me.  
###### 2
Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul;  
Like a weaned child {resting} with his mother,  
My soul is like a weaned child within me {composed and freed from discontent}.  
###### 3
O Israel, hope in the LORD  
From this time forth and forever.

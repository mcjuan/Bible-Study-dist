## Prayer for Protection from the Wicked.
###### 1
Listen to my words, O LORD,  
Consider my groaning *and* sighing.  
###### 2
Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God,  
For to You I pray.  
###### 3
In the morning, O LORD, You will hear my voice;  
In the morning I will prepare {a prayer and a sacrifice} for You and watch *and* wait {for You to speak to my heart}.
###### 4
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness;  
No evil {person} dwells with You.  
###### 5
The boastful *and* the arrogant will not stand in Your sight;  
You hate all who do evil.  
###### 6
You destroy those who tell lies;  
The LORD detests *and* rejects the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.  
###### 7
But as for me, I will enter Your house through the abundance of Your steadfast love *and* tender mercy;  
At Your holy temple I will bow {obediently} in reverence for You.
###### 8
O LORD, lead me in Your righteousness because of my enemies;  
Make Your way straight (direct, right) before me.  
###### 9
For there is nothing trustworthy *or* reliable *or* truthful in what they say;  
Their heart is destruction {just a treacherous chasm, a yawning gulf of lies}.  
Their throat is an open grave;  
They {glibly} flatter with their {silken} tongue.  
###### 10
Hold them guilty, O God;  
Let them fall by their own designs *and* councils!  
Cast them out because of the abundance of their transgressions,  
For they are mutinous *and* have rebelled against You.
###### 11
But let all who take refuge *and* put their trust in You rejoice,  
Let them ever sing for joy;  
Because You cover *and* shelter them,  
Let those who love Your name be joyful *and* exult in You.  
###### 12
For You, O LORD, bless the righteous man {the one who is in right standing with You};  
You surround him with favor as with a shield.

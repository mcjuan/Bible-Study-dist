## Lament over Defeat in Battle, and Prayer for Help.
###### 1
O God, You have rejected us *and* cast us off. You have broken {down our defenses and scattered} us;  
You have been angry; O restore us *and* turn again to us.  
###### 2
You have made the land quake, You have split it open;  
Heal its rifts, for it shakes *and* totters.  
###### 3
You have made Your people experience hardship;  
You have given us wine to drink that makes us stagger *and* fall.  
###### 4
You have set up a banner for those who fear You {with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder--a banner to shield them from attack},  
A banner that may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.  
###### 5
That Your beloved ones may be rescued,  
Save with Your right hand and answer us.
###### 6
God has spoken in His holiness {in His promises}:  
"I will rejoice, I will divide {the land of} Shechem and measure out the Valley of Succoth {west to east}.  
###### 7
"Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;  
Ephraim is My helmet;  
Judah is My scepter.  
###### 8
"Moab is My [^a]washbowl;  
Over Edom I shall throw My shoe {in triumph};  
Over Philistia I raise the shout {of victory}."
###### 9
Who will bring me into the besieged city {of Petra}?  
Who will lead me to Edom?  
###### 10
Have You not rejected us, O God?  
And will You not go out with our armies?  
###### 11
Give us help against the enemy,  
For the help of man is worthless (ineffectual, without purpose).  
###### 12
Through God we will have victory,  
For He will trample down our enemies.

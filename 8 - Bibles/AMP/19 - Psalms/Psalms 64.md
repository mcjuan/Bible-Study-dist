## Prayer for Protection from Secret Enemies.
###### 1
Hear my voice, O God, in my [^a]complaint;  
Guard my life from the terror of the enemy.  
###### 2
Hide me from the secret counsel *and* conspiracy of the ungodly,  
From the scheming of those who do wrong,  
###### 3
Who have sharpened their tongues like a sword.  
They aim venomous words as arrows,  
###### 4
To shoot from ambush at the blameless {one};  
Suddenly they shoot at him, without fear.  
###### 5
They encourage themselves in {their pursuit of} an evil agenda;  
They talk of laying snares secretly;  
They say, "Who will discover us?"  
###### 6
They devise acts of injustice, *saying*,  
"We are ready with a well-conceived plan."  
For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep (mysterious, unsearchable).
###### 7
But God will shoot them with an {unexpected} arrow;  
Suddenly they will be wounded.  
###### 8
So they will be caused to stumble;  
Their own tongue is against them;  
All who gaze at them will shake the head {in scorn}.  
###### 9
Then all men will fear {God's judgment};  
They will declare the work of God,  
And they will consider *and* wisely acknowledge what He has done.  
###### 10
The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in Him;  
All the upright in heart will glory *and* offer praise.

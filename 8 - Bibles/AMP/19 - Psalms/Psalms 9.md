## A Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Justice.
###### 1
I will give thanks *and* praise the LORD, with all my heart;  
I will tell aloud all Your wonders *and* marvelous deeds.  
###### 2
I will rejoice and exult in you;  
I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
###### 3
When my enemies turn back,  
They stumble and perish before You.  
###### 4
For You have maintained my right and my cause;  
You have sat on the throne judging righteously.  
###### 5
You have rebuked the nations, You have destroyed the wicked *and* unrepentant;  
You have wiped out their name forever and ever.  
###### 6
The enemy has been cut off *and* has vanished in everlasting ruins,  
You have uprooted their cities;  
The very memory of them has perished.
###### 7
But the LORD will remain *and* sit enthroned forever;  
He has prepared *and* established His throne for judgment.  
###### 8
And He will judge the world in righteousness;  
He will execute judgment for the nations with fairness (equity).  
###### 9
The LORD also will be a refuge *and* a stronghold for the oppressed,  
A refuge in times of trouble;  
###### 10
And those who know Your name {who have experienced Your precious mercy} will put their confident trust in You,  
For You, O LORD, have not abandoned those who seek You.
###### 11
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion;  
Declare among the peoples His {great and wondrous} deeds.  
###### 12
For He who avenges blood {unjustly shed} remembers them (His people);  
He does not forget the cry of the afflicted *and* abused.  
###### 13
Have mercy on me *and* be gracious to me, O LORD;  
See how I am afflicted by those who hate me,  
You who lift me up from the gates of death,  
###### 14
That I may tell aloud all Your praises,  
That in the gates of the daughter of Zion (Jerusalem)  
I may rejoice in Your salvation *and* Your help.  
###### 15
The nations have sunk down in the pit which they have made;  
In the net which they hid, their own foot has been caught.  
###### 16
The LORD has made Himself known;  
He executes judgment;  
The wicked are trapped by the work of their own hands. Higgaion (meditation) Selah.
###### 17
The wicked will turn to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),  
*Even* all the nations who forget God.  
###### 18
For the poor will not always be forgotten,  
Nor the hope of the burdened perish forever.  
###### 19
Arise, O LORD, do not let man prevail;  
Let the nations be judged before You.  
###### 20
Put them in {reverent} [^b]fear of You, O LORD,  
So that the nations may know they are but {frail and mortal} men. Selah.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 9:1 A transliteration of the Hebrew, whose meaning is unknown. Possibly referring to a tune titled “Death to the Son.” Perhaps for soprano voices.
[^b]: Psalm 9:20 The “fear” of God is a common concept in the OT, but is difficult to translate into English. It is not simply a matter of “fear” in the modern English sense. Nor is it only a sentiment of deep reverence. It implies obedience, as well.

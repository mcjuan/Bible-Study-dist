## The LORD a Refuge and Defense.
###### 1
In the LORD I take refuge {and put my trust};  
How can you say to me, "Flee like a bird to your mountain;  
###### 2
For look, the wicked are bending the bow;  
They take aim with their arrow on the string  
To shoot {by stealth} in darkness at the upright in heart.  
###### 3
"If the foundations {of a godly society} are destroyed,  
What can the righteous do?"
###### 4
The LORD is in His holy temple; the Lord's throne is in heaven.  
His eyes see, His eyelids test the children of men.  
###### 5
The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked,  
And His soul hates the {malevolent} one who loves violence.  
###### 6
Upon the wicked (godless) He will rain coals of fire;  
Fire and [^a]brimstone and a dreadful scorching wind will be the portion of their cup {of doom}.  
###### 7
For the LORD is {absolutely} righteous, He loves righteousness (virtue, morality, justice);  
The upright shall see His face.

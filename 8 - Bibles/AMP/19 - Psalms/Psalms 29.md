###### 1
Ascribe[^a] to the LORD, O [^b]sons of the mighty,
Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.  
###### 2
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name;  
Worship the LORD in the beauty *and* majesty of His holiness {as the creator and source of holiness}.
###### 3
The voice of the LORD is upon the waters;  
The God of glory thunders;  
The LORD is over many waters.  
###### 4
The voice of the LORD is powerful;  
The voice of the LORD is full of majesty.  
###### 5
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars;  
Yes, the LORD breaks in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.  
###### 6
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf,  
And Sirion (Mount Hermon) like a young, wild ox.  
###### 7
The voice of the LORD rakes flames of fire (lightning).  
###### 8
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness;  
The LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.  
###### 9
The voice of the LORD [^c]makes the doe labor *and* give birth  
And strips the forests bare;  
And in His temple all are saying, "Glory!"
###### 10
The LORD sat *as King* at the flood;  
Yes, the LORD sits as King forever.  
###### 11
The LORD will give {unyielding and impenetrable} strength to His people;  
The LORD will bless His people with peace.

## Pagan Idols Contrasted with the LORD.
###### 1
Not to us, O LORD, not to us,  
But to Your name give glory  
Because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth *and* faithfulness.  
###### 2
Why should the nations say,  
"Where, now, is their God?"  
###### 3
But our God is in heaven;  
He does whatever He pleases.  
###### 4
The idols {of the nations} are silver and gold,  
The work of man's hands.  
###### 5
They have mouths, but they cannot speak;  
They have eyes, but they cannot see;  
###### 6
They have ears, but they cannot hear;  
They have noses, but they cannot smell;  
###### 7
They have hands, but they cannot feel;  
They have feet, but they cannot walk;  
Nor can they make a sound with their throats.  
###### 8
Those who make them will become like them,  
Everyone who trusts in them.
###### 9
O Israel, trust *and* take refuge in the LORD! {Be confident in Him, cling to Him, rely on His word!}  
He is their help and their shield.  
###### 10
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD;  
He is their help and their shield.  
###### 11
You who {reverently} fear the LORD, trust in LORD;  
He is their help and their shield.  
###### 12
The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless,  
He will bless the house of Israel;  
He will bless the house of Aaron.  
###### 13
He will bless those who fear *and* worship the LORD {with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder},  
Both the small and the great.  
###### 14
May the LORD give you {great} increase,  
You and your children.  
###### 15
May you be blessed of the LORD,  
Who made heaven and earth.
###### 16
The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,  
But the earth He has given to the children of men.  
###### 17
The dead do not praise the LORD,  
Nor do any who go down into silence;  
###### 18
But as for us, we will bless *and* affectionately and gratefully praise the LORD  
From this time forth and forever.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

## Praise for Help.
###### 1
O LORD the king will delight in Your strength,  
And in Your salvation how greatly will he rejoice!  
###### 2
You have given him his heart's desire,  
And You have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.  
###### 3
For You meet him with blessings of good things;  
You set a crown of pure gold on his head.  
###### 4
He asked life of You,  
And You gave it to him,  
Long life forever and evermore.  
###### 5
His glory is great because of Your victory;  
Splendor and majesty You bestow upon him.  
###### 6
For You make him most blessed {and a blessing} forever;  
You make him joyful with the joy of Your presence.
###### 7
For the king {confidently} trusts in the LORD,  
And through the lovingkindness (faithfulness, goodness) of the Most High he will never be shaken.  
###### 8
Your hand will reach out *and* defeat all your enemies;  
Your right hand will reach those who hate you.  
###### 9
You will make them as {if in} a blazing oven in the time of your anger;  
The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath,  
And the fire will devour them.  
###### 10
Their offspring You will destroy from the earth,  
And their descendants from the sons of men.  
###### 11
For they planned evil against You;  
They devised a {malevolent} plot  
And they will not succeed.  
###### 12
For You will make them turn their backs {in defeat};  
You will aim Your bowstring {of divine justice} at their faces.  
###### 13
Be exalted, LORD, in Your strength;  
We will sing and praise Your power.

## A Psalm of Fearless Trust in God.
###### 1
The LORD is my light and my salvation--  
Whom shall I fear?  
The LORD is the refuge *and* fortress of my life--  
Whom shall I dread?  
###### 2
When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh,  
My adversaries and my enemies, they stumbled and fell.  
###### 3
Though an army encamp against me,  
My heart will not fear;  
Though war arise against me,  
Even in this I am confident.
###### 4
One thing I have asked of the LORD, and that I will seek:  
That I may dwell in the house of the LORD {in His presence} all the days of my life,  
To gaze upon the beauty {the delightful loveliness and majestic grandeur} of the LORD  
And to meditate in His temple.  
###### 5
For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter;  
In the secret place of His tent He will hide me;  
He will lift me up on a rock.  
###### 6
And now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me,  
In His tent I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy;  
I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD.
###### 7
Hear, O LORD, when I cry aloud;  
Be gracious *and* compassionate to me and answer me.  
###### 8
*When You said*, "Seek My face {in prayer, require My presence as your greatest need}," my heart said to You,  
"Your face, O LORD, I will seek {on the authority of Your word}."  
###### 9
Do not hide Your face from me,  
Do not turn Your servant away in anger;  
You have been my help;  
Do not abandon me nor [^a]leave me,  
O God of my salvation!  
###### 10
Although my father and my mother have abandoned me,  
Yet the LORD will take me up {adopt me as His child}.
###### 11
Teach me Your way, O LORD,  
And lead me on a level path  
Because of my enemies {who lie in wait}.  
###### 12
Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries,  
For false witnesses have come against me;  
They breathe out violence.  
###### 13
*I would have despaired* had I not believed that I would see the goodness of the LORD  
In the land of the living.  
###### 14
Wait for *and* confidently expect the LORD;  
Be strong and let your heart take courage;  
Yes, wait for *and* confidently expect the LORD.

## God Abases the Proud, but Exalts the Righteous.
###### 1
We give thanks *and* praise to You, O God, we give thanks,  
For Your {wonderful works declare that Your} [^a]name is near;  
People declare Your wonders.  
###### 2
"When I select an appointed time,  
I will judge with equity," {says the LORD}.  
###### 3
"The earth and all the inhabitants of it melt {in tumultuous times}.  
It is I who will steady its pillars. Selah.  
###### 4
"I said to the arrogant, 'Do not boast;'  
And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn {of self-glorification}.  
###### 5
'Do not lift up your {defiant and aggressive} horn on high,  
Do not speak with a stiff neck.'"
###### 6
For not from the east, nor from the west,  
Nor from the desert comes exaltation.  
###### 7
But God is the Judge;  
He puts down one and lifts up another.  
###### 8
For a cup {of His wrath} is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams;  
It is well mixed *and* fully spiced, and He pours out from it;  
And all the wicked of the earth must drain it and drink down to its dregs.
###### 9
But as for me, I will declare it *and* rejoice forever;  
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.  
###### 10
All the horns of the wicked He will cut off,  
But the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.

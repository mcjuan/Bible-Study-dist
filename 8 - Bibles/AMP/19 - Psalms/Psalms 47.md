## God the King of the Earth.
###### 1
O clap your hands, all you people;  
Shout to God with the voice of triumph *and* songs of joy.  
###### 2
For the LORD Most High is to be feared {and worshiped with awe-inspired reverence and obedience};  
He is a great King over all the earth.  
###### 3
He subdues peoples under us  
And nations under our feet.  
###### 4
He chooses our inheritance for us,  
The glory *and* excellence of Jacob whom He loves. Selah.
###### 5
God has ascended amid shouting,  
The LORD with the sound of a trumpet.  
###### 6
Sing praises to God, sing praises;  
Sing praises to our King, sing praises.  
###### 7
For God is the King of all the earth;  
Sing praises in a skillful psalm *and* with understanding.  
###### 8
God reigns over the nations;  
God sits on His holy throne.  
###### 9
The princes of the people have gathered together as the people of the God of Abraham,  
For the shields of the earth belong to God;  
He is highly exalted.

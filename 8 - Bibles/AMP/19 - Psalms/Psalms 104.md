## The Lord's Care over All His Works.
###### 1
Bless *and* affectionately praise the LORD, O my soul!  
O LORD my God, You are very great;  
You are clothed with splendor and majesty,  
###### 2
{You are the One} who covers Yourself with light as with a garment,  
Who stretches out the heavens like a tent curtain,  
###### 3
Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters {above the firmament},  
Who makes the clouds His chariot,  
Who walks on the wings of the wind,  
###### 4
Who makes winds His messengers,  
Flames of fire His ministers.
###### 5
He established the earth on its foundations,  
So that it will not be moved forever and ever.  
###### 6
You covered it with the deep as with a garment;  
The waters were standing above the mountains.  
###### 7
At Your rebuke they fled;  
At the sound of Your thunder they hurried away.  
###### 8
The mountains rose, the valleys sank down  
To the place which You established for them.  
###### 9
You set a boundary {for the waters} that they may not cross over,  
So that they will not return to cover the earth.
###### 10
You send springs into the valleys;  
Their waters flow among the mountains.  
###### 11
They give drink to every beast of the field;  
The wild donkeys quench their thirst there.  
###### 12
Beside them the birds of the heavens have their nests;  
They lift up their voices *and* sing among the branches.  
###### 13
He waters the mountains from His upper chambers;  
The earth is satisfied with the fruit of His works.
###### 14
He causes grass to grow for the cattle,  
And all that the earth produces for cultivation by man,  
So that he may bring food from the earth--  
###### 15
And wine which makes the heart of man glad,  
So that he may make his face glisten with oil,  
And bread to sustain *and* strengthen man's heart.  
###### 16
The trees of the LORD drink their fill,  
The cedars of Lebanon which He has planted,  
###### 17
Where the birds make their nests;  
As for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
###### 18
The high mountains are for the wild goats;  
The rocks are a refuge for the [^a]shephanim.  
###### 19
He made the moon for the seasons;  
The sun knows the {exact} place of its setting.  
###### 20
You {O LORD} make darkness and it becomes night,  
In which prowls about every wild beast of the forest.  
###### 21
The young lions roar after their prey  
And seek their food from God.  
###### 22
When the sun arises, they withdraw  
And lie down in their dens.  
###### 23
Man goes out to his work  
And remains at his labor until evening.
###### 24
O LORD, how many *and* varied are Your works!  
In wisdom You have made them all;  
The earth is full of Your riches *and* Your creatures.  
###### 25
There is the sea, great and broad,  
In which are swarms without number,  
Creatures both small and great.  
###### 26
There the ships {of the sea} sail,  
And Leviathan {the sea monster}, which You have formed to play there.
###### 27
They all wait for You  
To give them their food in its appointed season.  
###### 28
You give it to them, they gather it up;  
You open Your hand, they are filled *and* satisfied with good {things}.  
###### 29
You hide Your face, they are dismayed;  
You take away their breath, they die  
And return to their dust.  
###### 30
You send out Your Spirit, they are created;  
You renew the face of the ground.
###### 31
May the glory of the LORD endure forever;  
May the LORD rejoice *and* be glad in His works--  
###### 32
He looks at the earth, and it trembles;  
He touches the mountains, and they smoke.  
###### 33
I will sing to the LORD as long as I live;  
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  
###### 34
May my meditation be sweet *and* pleasing to Him;  
As for me, I will rejoice *and* be glad in the LORD.  
###### 35
Let sinners be consumed from the earth,  
And let the wicked be no more.  
Bless *and* affectionately praise the LORD, O my soul.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

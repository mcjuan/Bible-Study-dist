## Security of the One Who Trusts in the LORD.
###### 1
He who [^a]dwells in the shelter of the Most High  
Will remain secure *and* rest in the shadow of the Almighty {whose power no enemy can withstand}.  
###### 2
I will say of the LORD, "He is my refuge and my fortress,  
My God, in whom I trust {with great confidence, and on whom I rely}!"  
###### 3
For He will save you from the trap of the fowler,  
And from the deadly pestilence.  
###### 4
He will cover you *and* completely protect you with His pinions,  
And under His wings you will find refuge;  
His faithfulness is a shield and a wall.
###### 5
You will not be afraid of the terror of night,  
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,  
###### 6
Nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness,  
Nor of the destruction (sudden death) that lays waste at noon.  
###### 7
A thousand may fall at your side  
And ten thousand at your right hand,  
But danger will not come near you.  
###### 8
You will only {be a spectator as you} look on with your eyes  
And witness the {divine} repayment of the wicked {as you watch safely from the shelter of the Most High}.  
###### 9
Because you have made the LORD, {who is} my refuge,  
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,  
###### 10
No evil will befall you,  
Nor will any plague come near your tent.
###### 11
For He will command His angels in regard to you,  
To protect *and* defend *and* guard you in all your ways {of obedience and service}.  
###### 12
They will lift you up in their hands,  
So that you do not {even} strike your foot against a stone.  
###### 13
You will tread upon the lion and cobra;  
The young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.
###### 14
"Because he set his love on Me, therefore I will save him;  
I will set him {securely} on high, because he knows My name {he confidently trusts and relies on Me, knowing I will never abandon him, no, never}.  
###### 15
"He will call upon Me, and I will answer him;  
I will be with him in trouble;  
I will rescue him and honor him.  
###### 16
"With a long life I will satisfy him  
And I will let him see My salvation."

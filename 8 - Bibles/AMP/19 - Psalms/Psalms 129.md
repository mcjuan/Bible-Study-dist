## Prayer for the Overthrow of Zion's Enemies.
###### 1
"Many times they have persecuted me (Israel) from my youth,"  
Let Israel now say,  
###### 2
"Many times they have persecuted me from my youth,  
Yet they have not prevailed against me.  
###### 3
"The {enemies, like} plowers plowed on my back;  
They made their furrows {of suffering} long {in Israel}."  
###### 4
The LORD is righteous;  
He has cut in two the {thick} cords of the wicked {which enslaved the people of Israel}.
###### 5
May all who hate Zion  
Be put to shame and turned backward {in defeat}.  
###### 6
Let them be like the grass on the housetops,  
Which withers before it grows up,  
###### 7
With which the reaper does not fill his hand,  
Nor the binder of sheaves his arms,  
###### 8
Nor do those who pass by say,  
"The blessing of the LORD be upon you;  
We bless you in the name of the LORD."

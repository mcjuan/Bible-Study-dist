## God the Refuge of His People.
###### 1
God is our refuge and strength {mighty and impenetrable},  
A very present *and* well-proved help in trouble.  
###### 2
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth should change  
And though the mountains be shaken *and* slip into the heart of the seas,  
###### 3
Though its waters roar and foam,  
Though the mountains tremble at its roaring. Selah.
###### 4
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,  
The holy dwelling places of the Most High.  
###### 5
God is in the midst of her {His city}, she will not be moved;  
God will help her when the morning dawns.  
###### 6
The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered *and* were moved;  
He raised His voice, the earth melted.  
###### 7
The LORD of hosts is with us;  
The God of Jacob is our stronghold {our refuge, our high tower}. Selah.
###### 8
Come, behold the works of the LORD,  
Who has brought desolations *and* wonders on the earth.  
###### 9
He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth;  
He breaks the bow into pieces and snaps the spear in two;  
He burns the chariots with fire.  
###### 10
"Be still and know (recognize, understand) that I am God.  
I will be exalted among the nations! I will be exalted in the earth."  
###### 11
The LORD of hosts is with us;  
The God of Jacob is our stronghold {our refuge, our high tower}. Selah.

## Confidence in God's Protection.
###### 1
Hear my cry, O God;  
Listen to my prayer.  
###### 2
From the end of the earth I call to You, when my heart is overwhelmed *and* weak;  
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I {a rock that is too high to reach without Your help}.  
###### 3
For You have been a shelter *and* a refuge for me,  
A strong tower against the enemy.  
###### 4
Let me dwell in Your tent forever;  
Let me take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah.
###### 5
For You have heard my vows, O God;  
You have given me the inheritance of those who fear Your name {with reverence}.  
###### 6
You will prolong the king's life {adding days upon days};  
His years will be like many generations.  
###### 7
He will sit enthroned forever before {the face of} God;  
Appoint lovingkindness and truth to watch over *and* preserve him.  
###### 8
So I will sing praise to Your name forever,  
Paying my vows day by day.

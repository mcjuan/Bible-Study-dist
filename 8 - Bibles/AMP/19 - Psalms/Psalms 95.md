## Praise to the LORD, and Warning against Unbelief.
###### 1
O come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD;  
Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.  
###### 2
Let us come before His presence with a song of thanksgiving;  
Let us shout joyfully to Him with songs.  
###### 3
For the LORD is a great God  
And a great King above all gods,  
###### 4
In whose hand are the depths of the earth;  
The peaks of the mountains are His also.  
###### 5
The sea is His, for He made it {by His command};  
And His hands formed the dry land.
###### 6
O come, let us worship and bow down,  
Let us kneel before the LORD our Maker {in reverent praise and prayer}.  
###### 7
For He is our God  
And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand.  
Today, if you will hear His voice,  
###### 8
Do not harden your hearts *and* become spiritually dull as at Meribah {the place of strife},  
And as at Massah {the place of testing} in the wilderness,  
###### 9
"When your fathers tested Me,  
They tried Me, even though they had seen My work {of miracles}.  
###### 10
"For forty years I was grieved *and* disgusted with that generation,  
And I said, 'They are a people who err in their heart,  
And they do not acknowledge *or* regard My ways.'  
###### 11
"Therefore I swore {an oath} in My wrath,  
'They absolutely shall not enter My rest {the land of promise}.'"

## All Men Exhorted to Praise God.
###### 1
Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth.  
###### 2
Serve the LORD with gladness *and* delight;  
Come before His presence with joyful singing.  
###### 3
Know *and* fully recognize with gratitude that the LORD Himself is God;  
It is He who has made us, [^a]not we ourselves {and we are His}.  
*We are* His people and the sheep of His pasture.
###### 4
Enter His gates with a song of thanksgiving  
And His courts with praise.  
Be thankful to Him, bless *and* praise His name.  
###### 5
For the LORD is good;  
His mercy *and* lovingkindness are everlasting,  
His faithfulness {endures} to all generations.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 100:3 Some mss read *His we are*.

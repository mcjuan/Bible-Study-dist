## Evening Prayer of Trust in God.
###### 1
Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!  
You have freed me when I was hemmed in *and* relieved me when I was in distress;  
Be gracious to me and hear {and respond to} my prayer.
###### 2
O sons of men, how long will my honor *and* glory be {turned into} shame?  
*How long* will you {my enemies} love worthless (vain, futile) things and seek deception *and* lies? Selah.  
###### 3
But know that the LORD has set apart for Himself {and dealt wonderfully with} the godly man {the one of honorable character and moral courage--the one who does right}.  
The LORD hears *and* responds when I call to Him.
###### 4
Tremble {with anger or fear}, and do not sin;  
Meditate in your heart upon your bed and be still {reflect on your sin and repent of your rebellion}. Selah.  
###### 5
Offer righteous sacrifices;  
Trust {confidently} in the LORD.
###### 6
Many are saying, "Oh, that we might see some good!"  
Lift up the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.  
###### 7
You have put joy in my heart,  
More than {others know} when their wheat and new wine have yielded abundantly.  
###### 8
In peace {and with a tranquil heart} I will both lie down and sleep,  
For You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety *and* confident trust.

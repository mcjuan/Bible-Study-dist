## A Call to Worship the LORD the Righteous Judge.
###### 1
O sing to the LORD a new song;  
Sing to the LORD, all the earth!  
###### 2
Sing to the LORD, bless His name;  
Proclaim good news of His salvation from day to day.  
###### 3
Declare His glory among the nations,  
His marvelous works *and* wonderful deeds among all the peoples.  
###### 4
For great is the LORD and greatly to be praised;  
He is to be feared above all gods.  
###### 5
For all the gods of the peoples are {worthless, lifeless} idols,  
But the LORD made the heavens.  
###### 6
Splendor and majesty are before Him;  
Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.
###### 7
Ascribe[^a] to the LORD, O families of the peoples,
Ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.  
###### 8
Ascribe to the LORD the glory of His name;  
Bring an offering and come into His courts.  
###### 9
Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness;  
Tremble {in submissive wonder} before Him, all the earth.  
###### 10
Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns;  
Indeed, the world is firmly *and* securely established, it shall not be moved;  
He will judge *and* rule the people with fairness."
###### 11
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;  
Let the sea roar, and all the things it contains;  
###### 12
Let the field be exultant, and all that is in it.  
Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy  
###### 13
Before the LORD, for He is coming,  
For He is coming to judge the earth.  
He will judge the world with righteousness  
And the peoples in His faithfulness.

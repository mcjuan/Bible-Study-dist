## Prayer for Rescue from Persecutors.
###### 1
Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious *and* merciful to me,  
For my soul finds shelter *and* safety in You,  
And in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge *and* be confidently secure  
Until destruction passes by.  
###### 2
I will cry to God Most High,  
Who accomplishes *all things* on my behalf {for He completes my purpose in His plan}.  
###### 3
He will send from heaven and save me;  
He calls to account him who tramples me down. Selah.  
God will send out His lovingkindness and His truth.
###### 4
My life is among lions;  
I must lie among those who breathe out fire--  
The sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows,  
And their tongue a sharp sword.  
###### 5
Be exalted above the heavens, O God;  
Let Your glory *and* majesty be over all the earth.  
###### 6
They [^a]set a net for my steps;  
My very life was bowed down.  
They dug a pit before me;  
Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen. Selah.
###### 7
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast *and* confident!  
I will sing, yes, I will sing praises {to You}!  
###### 8
Awake, my glory!  
Awake, harp and lyre!  
I will awaken the dawn.  
###### 9
I will praise *and* give thanks to You, O Lord, among the people;  
I will sing praises to You among the nations.  
###### 10
For Your faithfulness *and* lovingkindness are great, reaching to the heavens,  
And Your truth to the clouds.  
###### 11
Be exalted above the heavens, O God;  
Let Your glory *and* majesty be over all the earth.

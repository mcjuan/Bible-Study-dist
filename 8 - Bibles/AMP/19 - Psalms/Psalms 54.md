## Prayer for Defense against Enemies.
###### 1
Save me, O God, by Your name;  
And vindicate me by Your {wondrous} power.  
###### 2
Hear my prayer, O God;  
Listen to the words of my mouth.  
###### 3
For strangers have risen against me  
And violent men have sought my life;  
They have not set God before them. Selah.
###### 4
Behold, God is my helper *and* ally;  
The Lord is the sustainer of my soul {my upholder}.  
###### 5
He will pay back the evil to my enemies;  
In Your faithfulness destroy them.
###### 6
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to You;  
I will give thanks *and* praise Your name, O LORD, for it is good.  
###### 7
For He has rescued me from every trouble,  
And my eye has looked *with satisfaction* (triumph) on my enemies.

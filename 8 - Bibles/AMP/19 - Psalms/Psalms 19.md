## The Works and the Word of God.
###### 1
The heavens are telling of the glory of God;  
And the expanse {of heaven} is declaring the work of His hands.  
###### 2
Day after day pours forth speech,  
And night after night reveals knowledge.  
###### 3
There is no speech, nor are there {spoken} words {from the stars};  
Their voice is not heard.  
###### 4
Yet their voice {in quiet evidence} has gone out through all the earth,  
Their words to the end of the world.  
In them *and* in the heavens He has made a tent for the sun,  
###### 5
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber;  
It rejoices as a strong man to run his course.  
###### 6
The sun's rising is from one end of the heavens,  
And its circuit to the other end of them;  
And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
###### 7
The law of the LORD is perfect (flawless), restoring *and* refreshing the soul;  
The statutes of the LORD are reliable *and* trustworthy, making wise the simple.  
###### 8
The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart;  
The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  
###### 9
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever;  
The judgments of the LORD are true, they are righteous altogether.  
###### 10
They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold;  
Sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb.  
###### 11
Moreover, by them Your servant is warned {reminded, illuminated, and instructed};  
In keeping them there is great reward.  
###### 12
Who can understand his errors *or* omissions? Acquit me of hidden (unconscious, unintended) *faults*.  
###### 13
Also keep back Your servant from presumptuous (deliberate, willful) *sins*;  
Let them not rule *and* have control over me.  
Then I will be blameless (complete),  
And I shall be acquitted of great transgression.  
###### 14
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  
Be acceptable *and* pleasing in Your sight,  
O LORD, my {firm, immovable} rock and my Redeemer.

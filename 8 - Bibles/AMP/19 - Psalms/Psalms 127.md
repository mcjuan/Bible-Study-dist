## Prosperity Comes from the LORD.
###### 1
Unless the LORD builds the house,  
They labor in vain who build it;  
Unless the LORD guards the city,  
The watchman keeps awake in vain.  
###### 2
It is vain for you to rise early,  
To retire late,  
To eat the bread of anxious labors--  
For He gives {blessings} to His beloved *even in his* sleep.
###### 3
Behold, children are a heritage *and* gift from the LORD,  
The fruit of the womb a reward.  
###### 4
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,  
So are the children of one's youth.  
###### 5
How blessed {happy and fortunate} is the man whose quiver is filled with them;  
They will not be ashamed  
When they speak with their enemies {in gatherings} at the {city} gate.

## Prayer for the Lord's Help.
###### 1
Unto you I lift up my eyes,  
O You who are enthroned in the heavens!  
###### 2
Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,  
And as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,  
So our eyes look to the LORD our God,  
Until He is gracious *and* favorable toward us.
###### 3
Be gracious to us, O LORD, be gracious *and* favorable toward us,  
For we are greatly filled with contempt.  
###### 4
Our soul is greatly filled  
With the scoffing of those who are at ease,  
And with the contempt of the proud {who disregard God's law}.

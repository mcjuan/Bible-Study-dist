The LORD upholds all those {of His own} who fall  
And raises up all those who are bowed down.

He will fulfill the desire of those who fear *and* worship Him {with awe-inspired reverence and obedience};  
He also will hear their cry and will save them.

The LORD keeps all who love Him,  
But all the wicked He will destroy.

My mouth will speak the praise of the LORD,  
And all flesh will bless *and* gratefully praise His holy name forever and ever.

## Praise and Supplication to God for Victory.
###### 1
O God, my heart is steadfast {with confident faith};  
I will sing, I will sing praises, even with my soul.  
###### 2
Awake, harp and lyre;  
I will awaken the dawn!  
###### 3
I will praise *and* give thanks to You, O LORD, among the people;  
And I will sing praises to You among the nations.  
###### 4
For Your lovingkindness is great *and* higher than the heavens;  
Your truth *reaches* to the skies.  
###### 5
Be exalted {in majesty}, O God, above the heavens,  
And Your glory above all the earth.  
###### 6
That Your beloved {ones} may be rescued,  
Save with Your right hand, and answer me!
###### 7
God has spoken in His [^a]holiness:  
"I will rejoice, I will portion out Shechem {as I divide Canaan among My people},  
And measure out the Valley of Succoth.  
###### 8
"Gilead is Mine, Manasseh is Mine;  
Ephraim also is the helmet of My head {My stronghold, My defense};  
Judah is My [^b]scepter.  
###### 9
"Moab is My washbowl;  
Over Edom I will throw My shoe {to show Edom is Mine};  
Over Philistia I will shout {in triumph}."
###### 10
Who will bring me into the fortified city {of Petra}?  
Who will lead me to Edom?  
###### 11
Have You not rejected us, O God?  
And will You not go out, O God, with our armies?  
###### 12
Give us help against the adversary,  
For deliverance by man is in vain {a worthless hope}.  
###### 13
With[^c] God we will do valiantly,
For it is He who will trample down our enemies.

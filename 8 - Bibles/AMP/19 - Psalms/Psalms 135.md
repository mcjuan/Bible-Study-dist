## Praise the Lord's Wonderful Works. Vanity of Idols.
###### 1
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)  
Praise the name of the LORD;  
Praise Him, O servants of the LORD (priests, Levites),  
###### 2
You who stand in the house of the LORD,  
In the courts of the house of our God,  
###### 3
Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good;  
Sing praises to His name, for it is gracious *and* lovely.  
###### 4
For the LORD has chosen {the descendants of} Jacob for Himself,  
Israel for His own special treasure *and* possession.
###### 5
For I know that the LORD is great  
And that our Lord is above all gods.  
###### 6
Whatever the LORD pleases, He does,  
In the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and all deeps--  
###### 7
Who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;  
Who makes lightning for the rain,  
Who brings the wind from His storehouses;
###### 8
Who struck the firstborn of Egypt,  
Both of man and animal;  
###### 9
Who sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt,  
Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.  
###### 10
Who struck many nations  
And killed mighty kings,  
###### 11
Sihon, king of the Amorites,  
Og, king of Bashan,  
And all the kingdoms of Canaan;  
###### 12
And He gave their land as a heritage,  
A heritage to Israel His people.  
###### 13
Your name, O LORD, endures forever,  
Your fame *and* remembrance, O LORD, {endures} throughout all generations.  
###### 14
For the LORD will judge His people  
And He will have compassion on His servants {revealing His mercy}.  
###### 15
The idols of the nations are silver and gold,  
The work of men's hands.  
###### 16
They have mouths, but they do not speak;  
They have eyes, but they do not see;  
###### 17
They have ears, but they do not hear,  
Nor is there any breath in their mouths.  
###### 18
Those who make idols are like them {absolutely worthless--spiritually blind, deaf, and powerless};  
So is everyone who trusts in *and* relies on them.
###### 19
O house of Israel, bless *and* praise the LORD {with gratitude};  
O house of Aaron, bless the LORD;  
###### 20
O house of Levi, bless the LORD;  
You who fear the LORD {and worship Him with obedience}, bless the LORD {with grateful praise}!  
###### 21
Blessed be the LORD from Zion,  
Who dwells {with us} at Jerusalem.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

## The Vanity of Life.
###### 1
I said, "I will guard my ways  
That I may not sin with my tongue;  
I will muzzle my mouth  
While the wicked are in my presence."  
###### 2
I was mute and silent {before my enemies},  
I refrained *even* from good,  
And my [^a]distress grew worse.  
###### 3
My heart was hot within me.  
While I was musing the fire burned;  
Then I spoke with my tongue:  
###### 4
"LORD, let me know my {life's} end  
And {to appreciate} the extent of my days;  
Let me know how frail I am {how transient is my stay here}.  
###### 5
"Behold, You have made my days as {short as} hand widths,  
And my lifetime is as nothing in Your sight.  
Surely every man at his best is a mere breath {a wisp of smoke, a vapor that vanishes}! Selah.  
###### 6
"Surely every man walks around like a shadow {in a charade};  
Surely they make an uproar for nothing;  
Each one builds up *riches*, not knowing who will receive them.
###### 7
"And now, Lord, for what do I expectantly wait?  
My hope {my confident expectation} is in You.  
###### 8
"Save me from all my transgressions;  
Do not make me the scorn *and* reproach of the {self-righteous, arrogant} fool.  
###### 9
"I am mute, I do not open my mouth,  
Because it is You who has done it.  
###### 10
"Remove Your plague from me;  
I am wasting away because of the conflict *and* opposition of Your hand.  
###### 11
"With rebukes You discipline man for sin;  
You consume like a moth what is precious to him;  
Surely every man is a mere breath {a wisp of smoke, a vapor that vanishes}. Selah.
###### 12
"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and listen to my cry;  
Do not be silent at my tears;  
For I am Your temporary guest,  
A sojourner like all my fathers.  
###### 13
"O look away from me, that I may smile *and* again know joy  
Before I depart and am no more."

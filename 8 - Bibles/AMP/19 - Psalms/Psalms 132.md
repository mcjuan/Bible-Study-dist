## Prayer for the Lord's Blessing Upon the Sanctuary.
###### 1
O LORD, remember on David's behalf  
All his hardship *and* affliction;  
###### 2
How he swore to the LORD  
And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:  
###### 3
"I absolutely will not enter my house,  
Nor get into my bed--  
###### 4
I certainly will not permit my eyes to sleep  
Nor my eyelids to slumber,  
###### 5
Until I find a place for the LORD,  
A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob (Israel)."
###### 6
Behold, we heard of it at Ephrathah;  
We found it in the field of Jaar.  
###### 7
Let us go into His tabernacle;  
Let us worship at His footstool.  
###### 8
Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place,  
You and the ark {the symbol} of Your strength.  
###### 9
Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness (right living),  
And let Your godly ones shout for joy.
###### 10
For the sake of Your servant David,  
Do not turn away the face of Your anointed.  
###### 11
The LORD swore to David  
A truth from which He will not turn back:  
"One of your [^b]descendants I will set upon your throne.  
###### 12
"If your children will keep My covenant  
And My testimony which I will teach them,  
Their children also shall sit upon your throne forever."
###### 13
For the LORD has chosen Zion;  
He has desired it for His dwelling place:  
###### 14
"This is My resting place forever" {says the LORD};  
"Here will I dwell, for I have desired it.  
###### 15
"I will abundantly bless her provisions;  
I will satisfy her poor with bread.  
###### 16
"Her priests also I will clothe with salvation,  
And her godly ones will shout aloud for joy.  
###### 17
"There I will make the horn (strength) of David grow;  
I have prepared a lamp for My anointed {fulfilling the promises}.  
###### 18
"His enemies I will clothe with shame,  
But upon himself shall his crown shine."

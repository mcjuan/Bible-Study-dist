## The Reign of the Righteous King.
###### 1
Give the king {knowledge of} Your judgments, O God,  
And {the spirit of} Your righteousness to the king's son {to guide all his ways}.  
###### 2
May he judge Your people with righteousness,  
And Your afflicted with justice.  
###### 3
The mountains will bring peace *and* prosperity to the people,  
And the hills, in {the establishment of} righteousness.  
###### 4
May he bring justice to the poor among the people,  
Save the children of the needy  
And crush the oppressor,
###### 5
Let them fear You {with awe-inspired reverence and worship You with obedience} while the sun endures,  
And as long as the moon {reflects light}, throughout all generations.  
###### 6
May he come down like rain on the mown grass,  
Like showers that water the earth.  
###### 7
In his days may the righteous flourish,  
And peace abound until the moon is no more.
###### 8
May he also rule from sea to sea  
And from the River {Euphrates} to the ends of the earth.  
###### 9
The nomads of the desert will bow before him,  
And his enemies will [^a]lick the dust.  
###### 10
The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring offerings;  
The kings of Sheba and Seba will offer gifts.  
###### 11
Yes, all kings will bow down before him,  
All nations will serve him.
###### 12
For he will rescue the needy when he cries for help,  
The afflicted *and* abused also, and him who has no helper.  
###### 13
He will have compassion on the poor and needy,  
And he will save the lives of the needy.  
###### 14
He will redeem their life from oppression *and* fraud and violence,  
And their blood will be precious in His sight.  
###### 15
So may he live, and may the gold of Sheba be given to him;  
And let them pray for him continually;  
Let them bless *and* praise him all day long.
###### 16
There will be an abundance of grain in the soil on the top of the [^b]mountains;  
Its fruit will wave like {the cedars of} Lebanon,  
And those of the city will flourish like grass of the earth.  
###### 17
May his name endure forever;  
May his name continue as long as the sun;  
And let men bless themselves by him;  
Let all nations call him blessed.
###### 18
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel,  
Who alone does wonderful things.  
###### 19
Blessed be His glorious name forever;  
And may the whole earth be filled with His glory.  
Amen and Amen.
###### 20
The prayers of David son of Jesse are ended.

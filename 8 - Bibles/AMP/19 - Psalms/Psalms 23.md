## The LORD, the Psalmist's Shepherd.
###### 1
The LORD is my Shepherd {to feed, to guide and to shield me},  
I shall not want.  
###### 2
He lets me lie down in green pastures;  
He leads me beside the still *and* quiet waters.  
###### 3
He refreshes *and* restores my soul (life);  
He leads me in the paths of righteousness  
for His name's sake.
###### 4
Even though I walk through the {sunless} [^a]valley of the shadow of death,  
I fear no evil, for You are with me;  
Your rod {to protect} and Your staff {to guide}, they comfort *and* console me.  
###### 5
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  
You have anointed *and* refreshed my head with [^b]oil;  
My cup overflows.  
###### 6
Surely goodness and mercy *and* unfailing love shall follow me all the days of my life,  
And I shall dwell forever {throughout all my days} in the house *and* in the presence of the LORD.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 23:4 Or *valley of deep darkness*.
[^b]: Psalm 23:5 In ancient times it was customary in hot climates for a host to provide his guest with olive oil to put on his head. The Lord blesses and anoints His believers with the Holy Spirit, whom oil symbolizes, to prepare them for His service.

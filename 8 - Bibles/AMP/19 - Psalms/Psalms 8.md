## The Lord's Glory and Man's Dignity.
###### 1
O LORD, our Lord,  
How majestic *and* glorious *and* excellent is Your name in all the earth!  
You have displayed Your splendor above the heavens.  
###### 2
Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babes You have established strength  
Because of Your adversaries,  
That You might silence the enemy *and* make the revengeful cease.
###### 3
When I see *and* consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,  
The moon and the stars, which You have established,  
###### 4
What is man that You are mindful of him,  
And the son of {earthborn} man that You care for him?  
###### 5
Yet You have made him a little lower than [^b]God,  
And You have crowned him with glory and honor.  
###### 6
You made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;  
You have put all things under his feet,  
###### 7
All sheep and oxen,  
And also the beasts of the field,  
###### 8
The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea,  
Whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
###### 9
O LORD, our Lord,  
How majestic *and* glorious *and* excellent is Your name in all the earth!

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 8:1 Or perhaps *to a particular key*; meaning uncertain.
[^b]: Psalm 8:5 LXX reads *angels*; Heb *Elohim* is usually translated “God” or “god.” But it can also mean “gods” (with a lowercase “g”) when it is used with reference to the pagan gods of other nations. See, for instance, Ex 20:3: “You shall have no other gods (*Elohim*) before Me.” Since there are no capital letters in Hebrew as there are in English, the meaning of Ps 8:5 is ambiguous. It may be saying that humans were created a little lower than God Himself, or it may say that humans were created a little lower than the heavenly beings.

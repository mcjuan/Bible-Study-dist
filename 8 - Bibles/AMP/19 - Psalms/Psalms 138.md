## Thanksgiving for the Lord's Favor.
###### 1
I will give You thanks with all my heart;  
I sing praises to You before the {pagan} gods.  
###### 2
I will bow down {in worship} toward Your holy temple  
And give thanks to Your name for Your lovingkindness and Your truth;  
For You have magnified Your word together with Your name.  
###### 3
On the day I called, You answered me;  
And You made me bold *and* confident with {renewed} strength in my life.
###### 4
All the kings of the land will give thanks *and* praise You, O LORD,  
When they have heard of the promises of Your mouth {which were fulfilled}.  
###### 5
Yes, they will sing of the ways of the LORD {joyfully celebrating His wonderful acts},  
For great is the glory *and* majesty of the LORD.  
###### 6
Though the LORD is exalted,  
He regards the lowly {and invites them into His fellowship};  
But the proud *and* haughty He knows from a distance.
###### 7
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me;  
You will stretch out Your hand against the wrath of my enemies,  
And Your right hand will save me.  
###### 8
The LORD will accomplish that which concerns me;  
Your {unwavering} lovingkindness, O LORD, endures forever--  
Do not abandon the works of Your own hands.

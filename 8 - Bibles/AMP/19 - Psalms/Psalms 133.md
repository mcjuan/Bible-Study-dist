## The Excellency of Brotherly Unity.
###### 1
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is  
For brothers to dwell together in unity!  
###### 2
It is like the precious oil {of consecration} poured on the head,  
Coming down on the beard,  
Even the beard of Aaron,  
Coming down upon the edge of his {priestly} robes {consecrating the whole body}.  
###### 3
It is like the dew of {Mount} Hermon  
Coming down on the hills of Zion;  
For there the LORD has commanded the blessing: life forevermore.

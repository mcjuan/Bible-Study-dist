## Prayer for the Peace of Jerusalem.
###### 1
I was glad when they said to me,  
"Let us go to the house of the LORD."  
###### 2
Our feet are standing  
Within your gates, O Jerusalem,  
###### 3
Jerusalem, that is built  
As a city that is firmly joined together;  
###### 4
To which the {twelve} tribes go up, even the tribes of the LORD,  
{As was decreed as} an ordinance for Israel,  
To give thanks to the name of the LORD.  
###### 5
For there the thrones of judgment were set,  
The thrones of the house of David.
###### 6
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:  
"May they prosper who love you {holy city}.  
###### 7
"May peace be within your walls  
And prosperity within your palaces."  
###### 8
For the sake of my brothers and my friends,  
I will now say, "May peace be within you."  
###### 9
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God {which is Jerusalem},  
I will seek your (the city's) good.

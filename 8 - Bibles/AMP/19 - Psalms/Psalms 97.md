## The Lord's Power and Dominion.
###### 1
The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice;  
Let the many islands *and* coastlands be glad.  
###### 2
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him {as at Sinai};  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.  
###### 3
Fire goes before Him  
And burns up His adversaries on all sides.  
###### 4
His lightnings have illuminated the world;  
The earth has seen and trembled.  
###### 5
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD,  
At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.  
###### 6
The heavens declare His righteousness,  
And all the peoples see His glory *and* brilliance.
###### 7
Let all those be {deeply} ashamed who serve carved images,  
Who boast in idols.  
Worship Him, all you gods!  
###### 8
Zion heard this and was glad,  
And the daughters (cities) of Judah rejoiced {in relief}  
Because of Your judgments, O LORD.  
###### 9
For You are the LORD Most High over all the earth;  
You are exalted far above all gods.
###### 10
You who love the LORD, hate evil;  
He protects the souls of His godly ones (believers),  
He rescues them from the hand of the wicked.  
###### 11
Light is sown {like seed} for the righteous *and* illuminates their path,  
And {irrepressible} joy {is spread} for the upright in heart {who delight in His favor and protection}.  
###### 12
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones {those whose moral and spiritual integrity places them in right standing with God},  
And praise *and* give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.

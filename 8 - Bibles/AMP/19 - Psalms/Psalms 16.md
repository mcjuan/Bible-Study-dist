## The Lord, the Psalmist's Portion in Life and Deliverer in Death.
###### 1
Keep *and* protect me, O God, for in You I have placed my trust *and* found refuge.  
###### 2
I said to the LORD, "You are my Lord;  
I have no good besides You."  
###### 3
As for the saints (godly people) who are in the land,  
They are the majestic *and* the noble *and* the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.  
###### 4
The sorrows {pain and suffering} of those who have chosen another *god* will be multiplied {because of their idolatry};  
I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood,  
Nor will I take their names upon my lips.
###### 5
The LORD is the portion of my inheritance, my cup {He is all I need};  
You support my lot.  
###### 6
The {boundary} lines {of the land} have fallen for me in pleasant places;  
Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.
###### 7
I will bless the LORD who has counseled me;  
Indeed, my heart (mind) instructs me in the night.  
###### 8
I have set the LORD continually before me;  
Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.  
###### 9
Therefore my heart is glad and my glory {my innermost self} rejoices;  
My body too will dwell {confidently} in safety,  
###### 10
For You will not abandon me to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),  
Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.  
###### 11
You will show me the path of life;  
In Your presence is fullness of joy;  
In Your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.

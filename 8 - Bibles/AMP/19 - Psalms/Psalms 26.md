## Protestation of Integrity and Prayer for Protection.
###### 1
Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity;  
I have {relied on and} trusted {confidently} in the LORD without wavering *and* I shall not slip.  
###### 2
Examine me, O LORD, and try me;  
Test my heart and my mind.  
###### 3
For Your lovingkindness is before my eyes,  
And I have walked {faithfully} in Your truth.  
###### 4
I do not sit with deceitful *or* unethical *or* worthless men,  
Nor seek companionship with pretenders (self-righteous hypocrites).  
###### 5
I hate the company of evildoers,  
And will not sit with the wicked.  
###### 6
I will wash my hands in innocence,  
And I will go about Your altar, O LORD,  
###### 7
That I may proclaim with the voice of thanksgiving  
And declare all Your wonders.
###### 8
O LORD, I love the habitation of Your house  
And the place where Your glory dwells.  
###### 9
Do not sweep my soul away with sinners,  
Nor {sweep away} my life with men of bloodshed,  
###### 10
In whose hands is a wicked scheme,  
And whose right hand is full of bribes.  
###### 11
But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity;  
Redeem me and be merciful *and* gracious to me.  
###### 12
My foot stands on a level place;  
In the congregations I will bless the LORD.

## Thanksgiving for Return from Captivity.
###### 1
When the LORD brought back the captives to Zion (Jerusalem),  
We were like those who dream {it seemed so unreal}.  
###### 2
Then our mouth was filled with laughter  
And our tongue with joyful shouting;  
Then they said among the nations,  
"The LORD has done great things for them."  
###### 3
The LORD has done great things for us;  
We are glad!
###### 4
Restore our [^b]captivity, O LORD,  
As the stream-beds in the South (the Negev) {are restored by torrents of rain}.  
###### 5
They who sow in tears shall reap with joyful singing.  
###### 6
He who goes back and forth weeping, carrying his bag of seed {for planting},  
Will indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.

## The Reign of the Lord's Anointed.
###### 1
Why are the [^a]nations in an [^b]uproar {in turmoil against God},  
And why do the people devise a vain *and* hopeless plot?  
###### 2
The kings of the earth take their stand;  
And the rulers take counsel together  
Against the LORD and His Anointed (the Davidic King, the Messiah, the Christ), saying,  
###### 3
"Let us break apart their {divine} bands {of restraint}  
And cast away their cords {of control} from us."
###### 4
He who sits {enthroned} in the heavens laughs {at their rebellion};  
The {Sovereign} [^c]Lord scoffs at them {and in supreme contempt He mocks them}.  
###### 5
Then He will speak to them in His {profound} anger  
And terrify them with His displeasure, saying,  
###### 6
"Yet as for Me, I have anointed *and* firmly installed My King  
Upon Zion, My holy mountain."
###### 7
"I will declare the decree of the LORD:  
He said to Me, 'You are My Son;  
This day {I proclaim} I have begotten You.  
###### 8
'Ask of Me, and I will assuredly give {You} the nations as Your inheritance,  
And the ends of the earth as Your possession.  
###### 9
'You shall break them with a rod of iron;  
You shall shatter them {in pieces} like earthenware.'"
###### 10
Now therefore, O kings, act wisely;  
Be instructed *and* take warning, O leaders (judges, rulers) of the earth.  
###### 11
Worship the LORD *and* serve Him with reverence {with awe-inspired fear and submissive wonder};  
Rejoice {yet do so} with trembling.  
###### 12
Kiss (pay respect to) the [^d]Son, so that He does not become angry, and you perish in the way,  
For His wrath may soon be kindled *and* set aflame.  
How blessed {fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God} are all those who take refuge in Him!

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 2:1 Or *Gentiles*.
[^b]: Psalm 2:1 I.e. a confusion of voices.
[^c]: Psalm 2:4 Heb *Adonai*.
[^d]: Psalm 2:12 The word in the original is *bar*, taken to be the Aramaic for “son.” But it is surprising that an Aramaic word would be used here. The ancient rabbis maintained that a different word with the same spelling in Hebrew was intended, whose meaning is “pure.” They claimed that it is a reference to the Torah, on the ground that all the words in the Torah are pure.

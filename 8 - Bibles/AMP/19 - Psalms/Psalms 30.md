## Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death.
###### 1
I will extol *and* praise You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up,  
And have not let my enemies rejoice over me.  
###### 2
O LORD my God,  
I cried to You for help, and You have healed me.  
###### 3
O LORD, You have brought my life up from Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead);  
You have kept me alive, so that I would not go down to the pit (grave).  
###### 4
Sing to the LORD, O you His godly ones,  
And give thanks at the mention of His holy *name*.  
###### 5
For His anger is but for a moment,  
His[^a] favor is for a lifetime.
Weeping may endure for a night,  
But a shout of joy comes in the morning.
###### 6
As for me, in my prosperity I said,  
"I shall never be moved."  
###### 7
By Your favor *and* grace, O LORD, you have made my mountain stand strong;  
You hid Your face, and I was horrified.  
###### 8
I called to You, O LORD,  
And to the Lord I made supplication (specific request).  
###### 9
"What profit is there in my blood (death), if I go down to the pit (grave)?  
Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your faithfulness {to man}?
###### 10
"Hear, O LORD, be gracious *and* show favor to me;  
O LORD, be my helper."  
###### 11
You have turned my mourning into dancing for me;  
You have taken off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,  
###### 12
That my soul may sing praise to You and not be silent.  
O LORD my God, I will give thanks to You forever.

## A Call to Praise the LORD for His Righteousness.
###### 1
O sing to the LORD a new song,  
For He has done marvelous *and* wonderful things;  
His right hand and His holy arm have [^b]gained the victory for Him.  
###### 2
The LORD has made known His salvation;  
He has {openly} revealed His righteousness in the sight of the nations.  
###### 3
He has {graciously} remembered His lovingkindness and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;  
All the ends of the earth have witnessed the salvation of our God.
###### 4
Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth;  
Shout {in jubilation} and sing for joy and sing praises.  
###### 5
Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre,  
With the lyre and the sound of melody.  
###### 6
With trumpets and the sound of the horn  
Shout with joy before the King, the LORD.
###### 7
Let the sea thunder *and* roar, and all the things it contains,  
The world and those who dwell in it.  
###### 8
Let the rivers clap their hands;  
Let the mountains sing together for joy *and* delight  
###### 9
Before the LORD, for He is coming to judge the earth;  
He will judge the world with righteousness  
And the peoples with fairness.

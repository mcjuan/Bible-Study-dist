## Prayer for Help in Trouble.
###### 1
I cry aloud with my voice to the LORD;  
I make supplication with my voice to the LORD.  
###### 2
I pour out my complaint before Him;  
I declare my trouble before Him.  
###### 3
When my spirit was overwhelmed *and* weak within me {wrapped in darkness},  
You knew my path.  
In the way where I walk  
They have hidden a trap for me.  
###### 4
Look to the right {the point of attack} and see;  
For there is no one who has regard for me {to act in my favor}.  
Escape has failed me *and* I have nowhere to run;  
No one cares about my life.
###### 5
I cried out to You, O LORD;  
I said, "You are my refuge,  
My portion in the land of the living.  
###### 6
"Give attention to my cry,  
For I am brought very low;  
Rescue me from my persecutors,  
For they are stronger than I.  
###### 7
"Bring my soul out of prison (adversity),  
So that I may give thanks *and* praise Your name;  
The righteous will surround me {in triumph},  
For You will look after me."

## The Folly of Trusting in Riches.
###### 1
Hear this, all peoples;  
Listen carefully, all inhabitants of the world,  
###### 2
Both low and high,  
Rich and poor together:  
###### 3
My mouth will speak wisdom,  
And the meditation of my heart will be understanding.  
###### 4
I will incline my ear *and* consent to a proverb;  
On the lyre I will unfold my riddle.
###### 5
Why should I fear in the days of evil,  
When the wickedness of those who would betray me surrounds me {on every side},  
###### 6
Even those who trust in *and* rely on their wealth  
And boast of the abundance of their riches?  
###### 7
None of them can by any means redeem {either himself or} his brother,  
Nor give to God a ransom for him--  
###### 8
For the ransom of his soul is too costly,  
And he should cease *trying* forever--  
###### 9
So that he should live on eternally,  
That he should never see the pit (grave) *and* undergo decay.
###### 10
For he sees *that even* wise men die;  
The fool and the stupid alike perish  
And leave their wealth to others.  
###### 11
Their inward thought is that their houses will continue forever,  
And their dwelling places to all generations;  
They have named their lands after their own names {ignoring God}.  
###### 12
But man, with all his {self} honor *and* pomp, will not endure;  
He is like the beasts that perish.
###### 13
This is the fate of those who are foolishly confident,  
And of those after them who approve {and are influenced by} their words. Selah.  
###### 14
Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead);  
Death will be their shepherd;  
And the upright shall rule over them in the morning,  
And their form *and* beauty shall [^a]be for Sheol to consume,  
So that they have no dwelling {on earth}.  
###### 15
But God will redeem my life from the power of Sheol,  
For He will receive me. Selah.
###### 16
Be not afraid when {an ungodly} man becomes rich,  
When the wealth *and* glory of his house are increased;  
###### 17
For when he dies he will carry nothing away;  
His glory will not descend after him.  
###### 18
Though while he lives he counts himself happy *and* prosperous--  
And though people praise you when you do well for yourself--  
###### 19
He shall go to the generation of his fathers;  
They shall never again see the light.  
###### 20
A man {who is held} in honor,  
Yet who lacks {spiritual} understanding *and* a teachable heart, is like the beasts that perish.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 49:14 The ancient rabbis read this as “will wear out Sheol,” which also matches the Hebrew, and interpreted it as referring to unending punishment, i.e. punishment even outlasting Gehinnom (hell).

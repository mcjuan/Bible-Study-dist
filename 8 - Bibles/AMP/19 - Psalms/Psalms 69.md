## A Cry of Distress and Imprecation on Adversaries.
###### 1
Save me, O God,  
For the waters have threatened my life {they have come up to my neck}.  
###### 2
I have sunk in deep mire, where there is no foothold;  
I have come into deep waters, where a flood overwhelms me.  
###### 3
I am weary with my crying; my throat is parched;  
My eyes fail while I wait {with confident expectation} for my God.  
###### 4
Those who hate me without cause are more than the hairs of my head;  
Those who would destroy me are powerful, being my enemies wrongfully;  
I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
###### 5
O God, You know my folly;  
My wrongs are not hidden from You.  
###### 6
Do not let those who wait {confidently} for You be [^a]ashamed through me, O Lord [^b]God of hosts;  
Do not let those who seek You {as necessary for life itself} be dishonored through me, O God of Israel,  
###### 7
Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;  
Confusion *and* dishonor have covered my face.  
###### 8
I have become estranged from my brothers  
And an alien to my mother's sons.  
###### 9
For zeal for Your house has consumed me,  
And the {mocking} insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.  
###### 10
When I wept *and* humbled myself with fasting,  
It became my reproach.  
###### 11
When I made sackcloth my clothing {as one in mourning},  
I became a byword {a mere object of scorn} to them.  
###### 12
They who sit in the {city's} gate talk about me *and* mock me,  
And I am the song of the drunkards.
###### 13
But as for me, my prayer is to You, O LORD, at an acceptable *and* opportune time;  
O God, in the greatness of Your favor *and* in the abundance of Your lovingkindness,  
Answer me with truth {that is, the faithfulness of Your salvation}.  
###### 14
Rescue me from the mire and do not let me sink;  
Let me be rescued from those who hate me and from the deep waters.  
###### 15
Do not let the floodwater overwhelm me,  
Nor the deep waters swallow me up,  
Nor the pit {of Sheol} shut its mouth over me.
###### 16
Answer me, O LORD, for Your lovingkindness is sweet *and* good *and* comforting;  
According to the greatness of Your compassion, turn to me.  
###### 17
Do not hide Your face from Your servant,  
For I am in distress; answer me quickly.  
###### 18
Draw near to my soul and redeem it;  
Ransom me because of my enemies {so that they do not delight in my distress}.  
###### 19
You know my reproach and my shame and my dishonor {how I am insulted};  
My adversaries are all before You {each one fully known}.
###### 20
Reproach *and* insults have broken my heart and I am so sick.  
I looked for sympathy, but there was none,  
And for comforters, but I found none.  
###### 21
They (self-righteous hypocrites) also gave me gall {poisonous and bitter} for my food,  
And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
###### 22
May their table {with all its abundance and luxury} become a snare {to them};  
And when they are in peace {secure at their sacrificial feasts}, *may it become* a trap.  
###### 23
May their eyes be dimmed so that they cannot see,  
And make their loins shake continually {in terror and weakness}.  
###### 24
Pour out Your indignation on them,  
And let {the fierceness of} Your burning anger overtake them.  
###### 25
May their encampment be desolate;  
May no one dwell in their tents.  
###### 26
For they have persecuted him whom You have struck,  
And they tell of the pain of those whom You have pierced *and* wounded.  
###### 27
Add {unforgiven} iniquity to their iniquity {in Your book},  
And may they not come into Your [^c]righteousness.  
###### 28
May they be blotted out of the book of life {and their lives come to an end}  
And may they not be recorded with the righteous (those in right standing with God).
###### 29
But I am sorrowful and in pain;  
May Your salvation, O God, set me {securely} on high.  
###### 30
I will praise the name of God with song  
And magnify Him with thanksgiving.  
###### 31
And it will please the LORD better than an ox  
Or a young bull with horns and hoofs.  
###### 32
The humble have seen it and are glad;  
You who seek God {requiring Him as your greatest need}, let your heart revive *and* live.  
###### 33
For the LORD hears the needy  
And does not despise His *who are* prisoners.
###### 34
Let heaven and earth praise Him,  
The seas and everything that moves in them.  
###### 35
For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah,  
That His servants may remain there and possess it.  
###### 36
The descendants of His servants will inherit it,  
And those who love His name will dwell in it.

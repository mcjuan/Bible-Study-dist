## Prosperity of the One Who Fears the LORD.
###### 1
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)  
Blessed {fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God} is the man who fears the LORD {with awe-inspired reverence and worships Him with obedience},  
Who delights greatly in His commandments.  
###### 2
His descendants will be mighty on earth;  
The generation of the upright will be blessed.  
###### 3
Wealth and riches are in his house,  
And his righteousness endures forever.  
###### 4
Light arises in the darkness for the upright;  
He is gracious and compassionate and righteous (upright--in right standing with God).  
###### 5
It is well with the man who is gracious and lends;  
He conducts his affairs with justice.  
###### 6
He will never be shaken;  
The righteous will be remembered forever.
###### 7
He will not fear bad news;  
His heart is steadfast, trusting {confidently relying on and believing} in the LORD.  
###### 8
His heart is upheld, he will not fear  
While he looks {with satisfaction} on his adversaries.  
###### 9
He has given freely to the poor;  
His righteousness endures forever;  
His horn will be exalted in honor.
###### 10
The wicked will see it and be angered,  
He will gnash his teeth and melt away {in despair and death};  
The desire of the wicked will perish *and* come to nothing.

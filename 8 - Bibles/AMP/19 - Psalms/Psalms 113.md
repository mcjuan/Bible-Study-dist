## The LORD Exalts the Humble.
###### 1
Praise[^a] the LORD! ([^b]Hallelujah!)
Praise, O servants of the LORD,  
Praise the name of the LORD.  
###### 2
Blessed be the name of the LORD  
From this time forth and forever.  
###### 3
From the rising of the sun to its setting  
The name of the LORD is to be praised {with awe-inspired reverence}.  
###### 4
The LORD is high above all nations,  
And His glory above the heavens.
###### 5
Who is like the LORD our God,  
Who is enthroned on high,  
###### 6
Who humbles Himself to regard  
The heavens and the earth?  
###### 7
He raises the poor out of the dust  
And lifts the needy from the ash heap,  
###### 8
That He may seat them with princes,  
With the princes of His people.  
###### 9
He makes the barren woman live in the house  
As a joyful mother of children.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 113:1 It is said that Psalms 113-118 were ordained by the prophets and Torah scholars to be recited as a unit on special holy days. The unit was called the *Hallel* (Heb “Praise”).
[^b]: Psalm 113:1 According to Jewish tradition, one who had the office of Reader in a congregation would read the Psalms of the *Hallel* aloud, and when he came to a command to “Praise the Lord” (Heb *Halelu Yah*), it was the congregation’s duty to respond with “Hallelujah!”

## A Petition to Be Saved from Death.
###### 1
O LORD, the God of my salvation,  
I have cried out {for help} by day and in the night before You.  
###### 2
Let my prayer come before You *and* enter into Your presence;  
Incline Your ear to my cry!  
###### 3
For my soul is full of troubles,  
And my life draws near the grave (Sheol, the place of the dead).  
###### 4
I am counted among those who go down to the pit (grave);  
I am like a man who has no strength {a mere shadow},  
###### 5
Cast[^a] away {from the living} *and* abandoned among the dead,
Like the slain who lie in a {nameless} grave,  
Whom You no longer remember,  
And they are cut off from Your hand.  
###### 6
You have laid me in the lowest pit,  
In dark places, in the depths.  
###### 7
Your wrath has rested heavily upon me,  
And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah.  
###### 8
You have put my friends far from me;  
You have made me an [^b]object of loathing to them.  
I am shut up and I cannot go out.  
###### 9
My eye grows dim with sorrow.  
O LORD, I have called on You every day;  
I have spread out my hands to You {in prayer}.
###### 10
Will You perform wonders for the dead?  
Shall the departed spirits arise and praise You? Selah.  
###### 11
Will Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave  
Or Your faithfulness in Abaddon (the underworld)?  
###### 12
Will Your wonders be known in the darkness?  
And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness {where the dead forget and are forgotten}?
###### 13
But I have cried out to You, O LORD, for help;  
And in the morning my prayer will come to You.  
###### 14
O LORD, why do You reject me?  
Why do You hide Your face from me?  
###### 15
I was afflicted and close to death from my youth on;  
I suffer Your terrors; I am overcome.  
###### 16
Your fierce wrath has swept over me;  
Your terrors have destroyed me.  
###### 17
They have surrounded me like flood waters all day long;  
They have completely encompassed me.  
###### 18
Lover and friend You have placed far from me;  
My familiar friends are in darkness.

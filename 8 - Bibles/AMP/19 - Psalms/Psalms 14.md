## Folly and Wickedness of Men.
###### 1
The {spiritually ignorant} fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."  
They are corrupt, they have committed repulsive *and* unspeakable deeds;  
There is no one who does good.  
###### 2
The LORD has looked down from heaven upon the children of men  
To see if there are any who understand (act wisely),  
Who {truly} seek after God, {longing for His wisdom and guidance}.  
###### 3
They have all turned aside, together they have become corrupt;  
There is no one who does good, not even one.
###### 4
Have all the workers of wickedness *and* injustice no knowledge,  
Who eat up my people as they eat bread,  
And do not call upon the LORD?  
###### 5
There they tremble with great fear,  
For God is with the {consistently} righteous generation.  
###### 6
You {evildoers} shamefully plan against the poor,  
But the LORD is his safe refuge.
###### 7
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  
When the LORD restores His captive people,  
Then Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad.

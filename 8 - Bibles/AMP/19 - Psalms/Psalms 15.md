## Description of a Citizen of Zion.
###### 1
O LORD, who may lodge {as a guest} in Your tent?  
Who may dwell {continually} on Your holy hill?  
###### 2
He who walks with integrity *and* strength of character, and works righteousness,  
And speaks *and* holds truth in his heart.  
###### 3
He does not slander with his tongue,  
Nor does evil to his neighbor,  
Nor takes up a reproach against his friend;  
###### 4
In his eyes an evil person is despised,  
But he honors those who fear the LORD {and obediently worship Him with awe-inspired reverence and submissive wonder}.  
He keeps his word even to his own disadvantage and does not change it {for his own benefit};  
###### 5
He does not put out his money at interest {to a fellow Israelite},  
And does not take a bribe against the innocent.  
He who does these things will never be shaken.

## Wickedness of Men and Lovingkindness of God.
###### 1
Transgression speaks {like an oracle} to the wicked (godless) {deep} within his heart;  
There is no fear (dread) of God before his eyes.  
###### 2
For he flatters *and* deceives himself in his own eyes  
*Thinking* that his sinfulness will not be discovered and hated {by God}.  
###### 3
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful;  
He has ceased to be wise *and* to do good.  
###### 4
He plans wrongdoing on his bed;  
He sets himself on a path that is not good;  
He does not reject *or* despise evil.
###### 5
Your lovingkindness *and* graciousness, O LORD, extend to the skies,  
Your faithfulness {reaches} to the clouds.  
###### 6
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God,  
Your judgments are like the great deep.  
O LORD, You preserve man and beast.  
###### 7
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!  
The children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.  
###### 8
They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house;  
And You allow them to drink from the river of Your delights.  
###### 9
For with You is the fountain of life {the fountain of life-giving water};  
In Your light we see light.
###### 10
O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You,  
And Your righteousness (salvation) to the upright in heart.  
###### 11
Do not let the foot of the proud {person} overtake me,  
And do not let the hand of the wicked drive me away.  
###### 12
There those who {are perverse and} do evil have fallen;  
They have been thrust down and cannot rise.

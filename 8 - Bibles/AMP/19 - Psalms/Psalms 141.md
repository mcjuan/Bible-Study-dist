## An Evening Prayer for Sanctification and Protection.
###### 1
LORD, I call upon You; hurry to me.  
Listen to my voice when I call to You.  
###### 2
Let my prayer be counted as incense before You;  
The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering.  
###### 3
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth;  
Keep watch over the door of my lips {to keep me from speaking thoughtlessly}.  
###### 4
Do not incline my heart to {consent to or tolerate} any evil thing,  
Or to practice deeds of wickedness  
With men who plan *and* do evil;  
And let me not eat of their delicacies (be tempted by their gain).
###### 5
Let the righteous {thoughtfully} strike (correct) me--it is a kindness {done to encourage my spiritual maturity}.  
It is {the choicest anointing} oil on the head;  
Let my head not refuse {to accept and acknowledge and learn from} it;  
For still my prayer is against their wicked deeds.  
###### 6
Their {wicked, godless} judges are thrown down the sides of the rocky cliff,  
And they {who followed them} will hear my words, for they are pleasant (just).  
###### 7
As when the one plows and breaks open the ground {and the soil scatters behind him},  
Our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol {by the injustices of the wicked}.
###### 8
For my eyes are toward You, O God, the Lord;  
In You I take refuge; do not pour out my life *nor* leave me defenseless.  
###### 9
Keep me from the jaws of the trap which they have set for me,  
And from the snares of those who do evil.  
###### 10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets,  
While I pass by *and* safely escape {from danger}.

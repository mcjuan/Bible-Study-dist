## Blessedness of the Fear of the LORD.
###### 1
Blessed {happy and sheltered by God's favor} is everyone who fears the LORD {and worships Him with obedience},  
Who walks in His ways *and* lives according to His commandments.  
###### 2
For you shall eat the fruit of {the labor of} your hands,  
You will be happy *and* blessed and it will be well with you.  
###### 3
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine  
Within the innermost part of your house;  
Your children will be like olive plants  
Around your table.  
###### 4
Behold, for so shall the man be blessed *and* divinely favored  
Who fears the LORD {and worships Him with obedience}.
###### 5
May the LORD bless you from Zion {His holy mountain},  
And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life;  
###### 6
Indeed, may you see your {family perpetuated in your} children's children.  
Peace be upon Israel!

## God Alone a Refuge from Treachery and Oppression.
###### 1
For God alone my soul *waits* in silence;  
From Him comes my salvation.  
###### 2
He alone is my rock and my salvation,  
My defense *and* my strong tower; I will not be shaken *or* disheartened.
###### 3
How long will you attack a man  
So that you may murder him, all of you,  
Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?  
###### 4
They consult only to throw him down from his high position {to dishonor him};  
They delight in lies.  
They bless with {the words of} their mouths,  
But inwardly they curse. Selah.
###### 5
For God alone my soul waits in silence *and* quietly submits to Him,  
For my hope is from Him.  
###### 6
He only is my rock and my salvation;  
My fortress *and* my defense, I will not be shaken *or* discouraged.  
###### 7
On God my salvation and my glory rest;  
He is my rock of {unyielding} strength, my refuge is in God.  
###### 8
Trust {confidently} in Him at all times, O people;  
Pour out your heart before Him.  
God is a refuge for us. Selah.
###### 9
Men of low degree are only a breath (emptiness), and men of {high} rank are a lie (delusion).  
In the balances they go up {because they have no measurable weight or value};  
They are together lighter than a breath.  
###### 10
Do not trust in oppression,  
And do not vainly hope in robbery;  
If riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
###### 11
God has spoken once,  
Twice I have heard this:  
That power belongs to God.  
###### 12
Also to You, O Lord, belong lovingkindness *and* compassion,  
For You compensate every man according to {the value of} his work.

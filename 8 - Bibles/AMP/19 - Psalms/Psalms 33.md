## Praise to the Creator and Preserver.
###### 1
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones;  
Praise is becoming *and* appropriate for those who are upright {in heart--those with moral integrity and godly character}.  
###### 2
Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre;  
Sing praises to Him with the harp of ten strings.  
###### 3
Sing to Him a new song;  
Play skillfully {on the strings} with a loud *and* joyful sound.  
###### 4
For the word of the LORD is right;  
And all His work is done in faithfulness.  
###### 5
He loves righteousness and justice;  
The earth is full of the lovingkindness of the LORD.
###### 6
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made,  
And all their host by the breath of His mouth.  
###### 7
He gathers the waters of the sea together as in a wineskin;  
He puts the deeps in storehouses.  
###### 8
Let all the earth fear *and* worship the LORD;  
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.  
###### 9
For He spoke, and it was done;  
He commanded, and it stood fast.  
###### 10
The LORD nullifies the counsel of the nations;  
He makes the thoughts *and* plans of the people ineffective.  
###### 11
The counsel of the LORD stands forever,  
The thoughts *and* plans of His heart through all generations.  
###### 12
Blessed {fortunate, prosperous, and favored by God} is the nation whose God is the LORD,  
The people whom He has chosen as His own inheritance.
###### 13
The LORD looks {down} from heaven;  
He sees all the sons of man;  
###### 14
From His dwelling place He looks closely  
Upon all the inhabitants of the earth--  
###### 15
He who fashions the hearts of them all,  
Who considers *and* understands all that they do.  
###### 16
The king is not saved by the great size of his army;  
A warrior is not rescued by his great strength.  
###### 17
A horse is a false hope for victory;  
Nor does it deliver anyone by its great strength.
###### 18
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon those who fear Him {and worship Him with awe-inspired reverence and obedience},  
On those who hope {confidently} in His compassion *and* lovingkindness,  
###### 19
To rescue their lives from death  
And keep them alive in famine.  
###### 20
We wait {expectantly} for the LORD;  
He is our help and our shield.  
###### 21
For in Him our heart rejoices,  
Because we trust {lean on, rely on, and are confident} in His holy name.  
###### 22
Let Your {steadfast} lovingkindness, O LORD, be upon us,  
In proportion as we have [^a]hoped in You.

## God's Rescue of Israel from Egypt.
###### 1
When Israel came out of Egypt,  
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,  
###### 2
Judah became His sanctuary,  
And Israel His dominion.
###### 3
The {Red} Sea [^a]looked and fled;  
The Jordan turned back.  
###### 4
The mountains leaped like rams,  
The {little} hills, like lambs.  
###### 5
What ails you, O sea, that you flee?  
O Jordan, that you turn back?  
###### 6
O mountains, that you leap like rams,  
O {little} hills, like lambs?
###### 7
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,  
At the presence of the God of Jacob (Israel),  
###### 8
Who turned the rock into a pool of water,  
The flint into a fountain of water.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Psalm 114:3 Some of the ancient rabbis said that the sea saw God’s right hand placed on Moses. Others said that it saw God’s name (*YHWH*) engraved on Moses’ staff.

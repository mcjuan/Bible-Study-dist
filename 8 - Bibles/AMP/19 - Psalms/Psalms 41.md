## The Psalmist in Sickness Complains of Enemies and False Friends.
###### 1
Blessed {by God's grace and compassion} is he who considers the helpless;  
The LORD will save him in the day of trouble.  
###### 2
The LORD will protect him and keep him alive;  
And he will be called blessed in the land;  
You do not hand him over to the desire of his enemies.  
###### 3
The LORD will sustain *and* strengthen him on his sickbed;  
In his illness, You will restore him to health.
###### 4
As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me;  
Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."  
###### 5
My enemies speak evil of me, *saying*,  
"When will he die and his name perish?"  
###### 6
And when one comes to see me, he speaks empty words,  
While his heart gathers malicious gossip {against me};  
When he goes away, he tells it {everywhere}.  
###### 7
All who hate me whisper together about me;  
Against me they devise my hurt {imagining the worst for me}, *saying*,  
###### 8
"A wicked thing is poured out upon him *and* holds him;  
And when he lies down, he will not rise up again."  
###### 9
Even my own close friend in whom I trusted,  
Who ate my bread,  
Has lifted up his heel against me {betraying me}.
###### 10
But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and [^a]restore me {to health},  
So that I may repay them.  
###### 11
By this I know that You favor *and* delight in me,  
Because my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.  
###### 12
As for me, You uphold me in my integrity,  
And You set me in Your presence forever.
###### 13
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,  
From everlasting to everlasting {from this age to the next, and forever}.  
Amen and Amen (so be it).

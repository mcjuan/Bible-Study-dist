## The Psalmist's Profession of Uprightness.
###### 1
I will sing of {steadfast} lovingkindness and justice;  
To You, O LORD, I will sing praises.  
###### 2
I will behave wisely *and* follow the way of integrity.  
When will You come to me?  
I will walk in my house in integrity *and* with a blameless heart.  
###### 3
I will set no worthless *or* wicked thing before my eyes.  
I hate the practice of those who fall away {from the right path};  
It will not grasp hold of me.  
###### 4
A perverse heart shall depart from me;  
I will not tolerate evil.  
###### 5
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will silence;  
The one who has a haughty look and a proud (arrogant) heart I will not tolerate.
###### 6
My eyes will be on the faithful (honorable) of the land, that they may dwell with me;  
He who walks blamelessly is the one who will minister to *and* serve me.  
###### 7
He who practices deceit will not dwell in my house;  
He who tells lies *and* half-truths will not continue {to remain} in my presence.  
###### 8
Morning after morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land,  
That I may cut off from the city of the LORD all those who do evil.

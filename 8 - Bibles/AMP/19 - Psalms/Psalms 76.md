## The Victorious Power of the God of Jacob.
###### 1
God is known in Judah;  
His name is great in Israel.  
###### 2
His tabernacle is in Salem (Jerusalem);  
His dwelling place is in Zion.  
###### 3
There He broke the flaming arrows,  
The shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah.
###### 4
You are glorious *and* resplendent,  
More majestic than the mountains of prey.  
###### 5
The stouthearted have been stripped of their spoil,  
They have slept the sleep {of death};  
And none of the warriors could use his hands.  
###### 6
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,  
Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep {of death}.  
###### 7
You, even You, are to be feared {with the submissive wonder of reverence};  
Who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry?
###### 8
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;  
The earth feared and was quiet  
###### 9
When God arose to {establish} judgment,  
To save all the humble of the earth. Selah.  
###### 10
For the wrath of man shall praise You;  
With a remnant of wrath You will clothe *and* arm Yourself.
###### 11
Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them;  
Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared {with awe-inspired reverence}.  
###### 12
He will cut off the spirit of princes;  
He is awesome *and* feared by the kings of the earth.

## An Experience of the Captivity.
###### 1
By the rivers of Babylon,  
There we {captives} sat down and wept,  
When we remembered Zion {the city God imprinted on our hearts}.  
###### 2
On the willow trees in the midst of Babylon  
We hung our harps.  
###### 3
For there they who took us captive demanded of us a song with words,  
And our tormentors {who made a mockery of us demanded} amusement, *saying*,  
"Sing us one of the songs of Zion."
###### 4
How can we sing the Lord's song  
In a strange *and* foreign land?  
###### 5
If I forget you, O Jerusalem,  
Let my right hand forget {her skill with the harp}.  
###### 6
Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth  
If I do not remember you,  
If I do not prefer Jerusalem  
Above my chief joy.
###### 7
Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom,  
The day of {the fall of} Jerusalem,  
Who said "Down, down {with her}  
To her very foundation."  
###### 8
O daughter of Babylon, you devastator,  
How blessed will be the one  
Who repays you {with destruction} as you have repaid us.  
###### 9
How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones  
Against the rock.

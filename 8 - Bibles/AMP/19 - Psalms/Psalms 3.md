## Morning Prayer of Trust in God.
###### 1
O LORD, how my enemies have increased!  
Many are rising up against me.  
###### 2
Many are saying of me,  
"There is no help {no salvation} for him in God." [^a]Selah.
###### 3
But You, O LORD, are a shield for me,  
My glory {and my honor}, and the One who lifts my head.  
###### 4
With my voice I was crying to the LORD,  
And He answered me from His holy mountain. Selah.  
###### 5
I lay down and slept {safely};  
I awakened, for the LORD sustains me.  
###### 6
I will not be intimidated *or* afraid of the ten thousands  
Who have set themselves against me all around.
###### 7
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God!  
For You have struck all my enemies on the cheek;  
You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.  
###### 8
Salvation belongs to the LORD;  
May Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah.

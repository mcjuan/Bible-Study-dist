## Prayer for Rescue.
###### 1
Judge *and* vindicate me, O God; plead my case against an ungodly nation.  
O rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man!  
###### 2
For You are the God of my strength {my stronghold--in whom I take refuge}; why have You rejected me?  
Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
###### 3
O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;  
Let them bring me to Your holy hill  
And to Your dwelling places.  
###### 4
Then I will go to the altar of God,  
To God, my exceeding joy;  
With the lyre I will praise You, O God, my God!
###### 5
Why are you in despair, O my soul?  
And why are you restless *and* disturbed within me?  
Hope in God *and* wait expectantly for Him, for I shall again praise Him,  
The [^a]help of my {sad} countenance and my God.

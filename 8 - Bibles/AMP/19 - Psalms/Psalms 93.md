## The Majesty of the LORD.
###### 1
The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty *and* splendor;  
The LORD has clothed and encircled Himself with strength;  
the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.  
###### 2
Your throne is established from of old;  
You are from everlasting.
###### 3
The floods have lifted up, O LORD,  
The floods have lifted up their voice;  
The floods lift up their pounding waves.  
###### 4
More than the sounds of many waters,  
More than the mighty breakers of the sea,  
The LORD on high is mighty.  
###### 5
Your precepts are fully confirmed *and* completely reliable;  
Holiness adorns Your house,  
O LORD, forever.

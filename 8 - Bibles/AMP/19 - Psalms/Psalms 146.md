## The LORD an Abundant Helper.
###### 1
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)  
Praise the LORD, O my soul!  
###### 2
While I live I will praise the LORD;  
I will sing praises to my God as long as I live.  
###### 3
Do not trust in princes,  
In mortal man, in whom there is no salvation (help).  
###### 4
When his spirit leaves him, he returns to the earth;  
In that very day his thoughts *and* plans perish.  
###### 5
How blessed *and* graciously favored is he whose help is the God of Jacob (Israel),  
Whose hope is in the LORD his God,  
###### 6
Who made heaven and earth,  
The sea, and all that is in them,  
Who keeps truth *and* is faithful forever,  
###### 7
Who executes justice for the oppressed,  
Who gives food to the hungry.  
The LORD sets free the prisoners.
###### 8
The LORD opens *the eyes of* the blind;  
The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down;  
The LORD loves the [^a]righteous {the upright in heart}.  
###### 9
The LORD protects the strangers;  
He supports the fatherless and the widow;  
But He makes crooked the way of the wicked.  
###### 10
The LORD shall reign forever,  
Your God, O Zion, to all generations.  
Praise the LORD! (Hallelujah!)

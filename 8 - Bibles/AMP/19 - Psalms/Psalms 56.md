## Supplication for Rescue and Grateful Trust in God.
###### 1
Be gracious to me, O God, for man has trampled on me;  
All day long the adversary oppresses *and* torments me.  
###### 2
My enemies have trampled upon me all day long,  
For they are many who fight proudly against me.  
###### 3
When I am afraid,  
I will put my trust *and* faith in You.  
###### 4
In God, whose word I praise;  
In God I have put my trust;  
I shall not fear.  
What can mere man do to me?  
###### 5
All day long they twist my words *and* say hurtful things;  
All their thoughts are against me for evil.  
###### 6
They attack, they hide *and* lurk,  
They watch my steps,  
As they have {expectantly} waited *to take* my life.  
###### 7
Cast them out because of their wickedness.  
In anger bring down the peoples, O God!
###### 8
You have taken account of my wanderings;  
Put my tears in Your bottle.  
Are they not recorded in Your book?  
###### 9
Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call;  
This I know, that God is for me.  
###### 10
In God, *whose* word I praise,  
In the LORD, *whose* word I praise,  
###### 11
In God have I put my trust *and* confident reliance; I will not be afraid.  
What can man do to me?  
###### 12
Your vows are *binding* upon me, O God;  
I will give thank offerings to You.  
###### 13
For You have rescued my soul from death,  
Yes, and my feet from stumbling,  
So that I may walk before God  
In the light of life.

## Praise to the LORD for His Fidelity to Israel.
###### 1
The LORD reigns, let the peoples tremble {with submissive wonder}!  
He sits enthroned above the cherubim, let the earth shake!  
###### 2
The LORD is great in Zion,  
And He is exalted *and* magnified above all the peoples.  
###### 3
Let them {reverently} praise Your great and awesome name;  
Holy is He.  
###### 4
The strength of the King loves justice *and* righteous judgment;  
You have established fairness;  
You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob (Israel).  
###### 5
Exalt the LORD our God  
And worship at His footstool;  
Holy is He.
###### 6
Moses and Aaron were among His priests,  
And Samuel was among those who called on His name;  
They called upon the LORD and He answered them.  
###### 7
He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud;  
They kept His testimonies  
And the statutes that He gave them.  
###### 8
You answered them, O LORD our God;  
You were a forgiving God to them,  
And yet an avenger of their *evil* practices.  
###### 9
Exalt the LORD our God  
And worship at His holy hill {Zion, the temple mount},  
For the LORD our God is holy.

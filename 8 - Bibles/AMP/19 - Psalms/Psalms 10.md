## A Prayer for the Overthrow of the Wicked.
###### 1
Why do You stand far away, O LORD?  
Why do You hide {Yourself, veiling Your eyes} in times of trouble?  
###### 2
In pride *and* arrogance the wicked hotly pursue *and* persecute the afflicted;  
Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.
###### 3
For the wicked boasts *and* sings the praises of his heart's desire,  
And the greedy man curses and spurns {and even despises} the LORD.  
###### 4
The wicked, in the haughtiness of his face, will not seek *nor* inquire for *Him*;  
All his thoughts are, "There is no God {so there is no accountability or punishment}."
###### 5
His ways prosper at all times;  
Your judgments {LORD} are on high, out of his sight {so he never thinks about them};  
As for all his enemies, he sneers at them.  
###### 6
He says to himself, "I will not be moved;  
For throughout all generations I will not be in adversity {for nothing bad will happen to me}."  
###### 7
His mouth is full of curses and deceit (fraud) and oppression;  
Under his tongue is mischief and wickedness {injustice and sin}.  
###### 8
He lurks in ambush in the villages;  
In hiding places he kills the innocent;  
He lies in wait for the unfortunate {the unhappy, the poor, the helpless}.  
###### 9
He lurks in a hiding place like a lion in his lair;  
He lies in wait to catch the afflicted;  
He catches the afflicted when he draws him into his net.  
###### 10
He crushes {his prey} and crouches;  
And the unfortunate fall by his mighty *claws*.  
###### 11
He says to himself, "God has {quite} forgotten;  
He has hidden His face; He will never see my deed."
###### 12
Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand {in judgment};  
Do not forget the suffering.  
###### 13
Why has the wicked spurned *and* shown disrespect to God?  
He has said to himself, "You will not require me to account."  
###### 14
You have seen it, for You have noted mischief and vexation (irritation) to take it into Your hand.  
The unfortunate commits *himself* to You;  
You are the helper of the fatherless.  
###### 15
Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer,  
Seek out his wickedness until You find no more.
###### 16
The LORD is King forever and ever;  
The nations will perish from His land.  
###### 17
O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble *and* oppressed;  
You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear to hear,  
###### 18
To vindicate *and* obtain justice for the fatherless and the oppressed,  
So that man who is of the earth will no longer terrify them.

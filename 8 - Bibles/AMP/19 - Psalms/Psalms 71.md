## Prayer of an Old Man for Rescue.
###### 1
In you, O LORD, I have put my trust *and* confidently taken refuge;  
Let me never be [^a]put to shame.  
###### 2
In Your righteousness deliver me and rescue me;  
Incline Your ear to me and save me.  
###### 3
Be to me a rock of refuge *and* a sheltering stronghold to which I may continually come;  
You have given the commandment to save me,  
For You are my rock and my fortress.  
###### 4
Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked (godless),  
From the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.  
###### 5
For You are my hope;  
O Lord God, *You are* my trust *and* the source of my confidence from my youth.  
###### 6
Upon You have I relied *and* been sustained from my birth;  
You are He who took me from my mother's womb *and* You have been my benefactor from that day.  
My praise is continually of You.
###### 7
I am as a wonder to many,  
For You are my strong refuge.  
###### 8
My mouth is filled with Your praise  
And with Your glory all day long.  
###### 9
Do not cast me off *nor* send me away in the time of old age;  
Do not abandon me when my strength fails *and* I am weak.  
###### 10
For my enemies have spoken against me;  
Those who watch for my life have consulted together,  
###### 11
Saying, "God has abandoned him;  
Pursue and seize him, for there is no one to rescue *him*."
###### 12
O God, do not be far from me;  
O my God, come quickly to help me!  
###### 13
Let those who attack my life be ashamed and consumed;  
Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor, who seek to injure me.  
###### 14
But as for me, I will wait *and* hope continually,  
And will praise You yet more and more.  
###### 15
My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness  
And of Your {deeds of} salvation all day long,  
For their number is more than I know.  
###### 16
I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord God {and in His strength};  
I will make mention of Your righteousness, Yours alone.
###### 17
O God, You have taught me from my youth,  
And I still declare Your wondrous works *and* miraculous deeds.  
###### 18
And even when I am old and gray-headed, O God, do not abandon me,  
Until I declare Your {mighty} strength to this generation,  
Your power to all who are to come.  
###### 19
Your righteousness, O God, *reaches* to the {height of the} heavens,  
You who have done great things;  
O God, who is like You, {who is Your equal}?  
###### 20
You who have shown [^b]me many troubles and distresses  
Will revive *and* renew me again,  
And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.  
###### 21
May You increase my greatness (honor)  
And turn to comfort me.
###### 22
I will also praise You with the harp,  
Your truth *and* faithfulness, O my God;  
To You I will sing praises with the lyre,  
O Holy One of Israel.  
###### 23
My lips will shout for joy when I sing praises to You,  
And my soul, which You have redeemed.  
###### 24
My tongue also will speak of Your righteousness all day long;  
For they are ashamed, for they are humiliated who seek my injury.

## A Lament over the Destruction of Jerusalem, and Prayer for Help.
###### 1
O God, the nations have invaded {the land of Your people} Your inheritance;  
They have defiled Your sacred temple;  
They have laid Jerusalem in ruins.  
###### 2
They have given the dead bodies of Your servants as food to the birds of the heavens,  
The flesh of Your godly ones to the beasts of the earth.  
###### 3
They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem,  
And there was no one to bury them.  
###### 4
We have become an object of taunting to our neighbors {because of our humiliation},  
A derision and mockery to those who encircle us.  
###### 5
How long, O LORD? Will You be angry forever?  
Will Your jealousy {which cannot endure a divided allegiance} burn like fire?  
###### 6
Pour out Your wrath on the {Gentile} nations that do not know You,  
And on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.  
###### 7
For they have devoured Jacob  
And made his pasture desolate.
###### 8
O do not remember against us the sins *and* guilt of our forefathers.  
Let Your compassion *and* mercy come quickly to meet us,  
For we have been brought very low.  
###### 9
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of Your name;  
Rescue us, forgive us our sins for Your name's sake.  
###### 10
Why should the {Gentile} nations say, "Where is their God?"  
Let there be known {without delay} among the nations in our sight {and to this generation},  
Your vengeance for the blood of Your servants which has been poured out.  
###### 11
Let the groaning *and* sighing of the prisoner come before You;  
According to the greatness of Your power keep safe those who are doomed to die.  
###### 12
And return into the lap of our neighbors sevenfold  
The taunts with which they have taunted You, O Lord.  
###### 13
So we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture,  
Will give You thanks forever;  
We will declare *and* publish Your praise from generation to generation.

## Prayer for Rescue from Enemies.
###### 1
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;  
Set me *securely* on an inaccessibly high place away from those who rise up against me.  
###### 2
Deliver me from those who practice wrongdoing,  
And save me from bloodthirsty men.  
###### 3
Look! They lie in wait for my life;  
Fierce *and* powerful men {are uniting together to} launch an attack against me,  
Not for my wrongdoing nor for any sin of mine, O LORD.  
###### 4
They run and set themselves against me though there is no guilt in me;  
Stir Yourself to meet *and* help me, and see {what they are doing}!  
###### 5
You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel,  
Arise to punish all the nations;  
Spare no one *and* do not be merciful to any who treacherously plot evil. Selah.  
###### 6
They return at evening, they howl *and* snarl like dogs,  
And go {prowling} around the city.  
###### 7
Look how they belch out {insults} with their mouths;  
Swords {of sarcasm, ridicule, slander, and lies} are in their lips,  
For *they say*, "Who hears us?"  
###### 8
But You, O LORD, will laugh at them {in scorn};  
You scoff at *and* deride all the nations.
###### 9
O {God} my strength, I will watch for You;  
For God is my stronghold {my refuge, my protector, my high tower}.  
###### 10
My God in His {steadfast} lovingkindness will meet me;  
God will let me look *triumphantly* on my enemies {who lie in wait for me}.  
###### 11
Do not kill them, or my people will forget;  
Scatter them *and* make them wander {endlessly} back and forth by Your power, and bring them down,  
O Lord our shield!  
###### 12
For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips,  
Let them even be trapped in their pride,  
And on account of the curses and lies which they tell.  
###### 13
Destroy *them* in wrath, destroy *them* so that they may be no more;  
Let them know that God rules over Jacob (Israel)  
To the ends of the earth. Selah.  
###### 14
They return at evening, they howl *and* snarl like dogs,  
And go {prowling} around the city.  
###### 15
They wander around for food {to devour}  
And growl all night if they are not satisfied.
###### 16
But as for me, I will sing of Your mighty strength *and* power;  
Yes, I will sing joyfully of Your lovingkindness in the morning;  
For You have been my stronghold  
And a refuge in the day of my distress.  
###### 17
To You, O {God} my strength, I will sing praises;  
For God is my stronghold {my refuge, my protector, my high tower}, the God who shows me {steadfast} lovingkindness.

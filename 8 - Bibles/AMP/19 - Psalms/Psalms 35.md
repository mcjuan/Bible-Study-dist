## Prayer for Rescue from Enemies.
###### 1
Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me;  
Fight against those who fight against me.  
###### 2
Take hold of shield and buckler ([^a]small shield),  
And stand up for my help.  
###### 3
Draw also the spear and javelin to meet those who pursue me.  
Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."  
###### 4
Let those be ashamed and dishonored who seek my life;  
Let those be turned back {in defeat} and humiliated who plot evil against me.  
###### 5
Let them be {blown away} like chaff before the wind {worthless, without substance},  
With the angel of the LORD driving them on.  
###### 6
Let their way be dark and slippery,  
With the angel of the LORD pursuing *and* harassing them.  
###### 7
For without cause they hid their net for me;  
Without cause they dug a pit {of destruction} for my life.  
###### 8
Let destruction come upon my enemy by surprise;  
Let the net he hid for me catch him;  
Into that very destruction let him fall.
###### 9
Then my soul shall rejoice in the LORD;  
It shall rejoice in His salvation.  
###### 10
All my bones will say, "LORD, who is like You,  
Who rescues the afflicted from him who is too strong for him {to resist alone},  
And the afflicted and the needy from him who robs him?"  
###### 11
Malicious witnesses rise up;  
They ask me of things that I do not know.  
###### 12
They repay me evil for good,  
To the sorrow of my soul.  
###### 13
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth (mourning garment);  
I humbled my soul with fasting,  
And I prayed with my head bowed on my chest.  
###### 14
I behaved as if grieving for my friend or my brother;  
I bowed down in mourning, as one who sorrows for his mother.  
###### 15
But in my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered together {against me};  
The slanderers whom I did not know gathered against me;  
They slandered *and* reviled me without ceasing.  
###### 16
Like godless jesters at a feast,  
They gnashed at me with their teeth {in malice}.
###### 17
LORD, how long will You look on {without action}?  
Rescue my life from their destructions,  
My only *life* from the young lions.  
###### 18
I will give You thanks in the great congregation;  
I will praise You among a mighty people.  
###### 19
Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me;  
Nor let those who hate me without cause wink their eye {maliciously}.  
###### 20
For they do not speak peace,  
But they devise deceitful words {half-truths and lies} against those who are quiet in the land.  
###### 21
They open their mouths wide against me;  
They say, "Aha, aha, our eyes have seen it!"
###### 22
You have seen this, O LORD; do not keep silent.  
O Lord, do not be far from me.  
###### 23
Wake Yourself up, and arise to my right  
And to my cause, my God and my Lord.  
###### 24
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to Your righteousness *and* justice;  
And do not let them rejoice over me.  
###### 25
Do not let them say in their heart, "Aha, that is what we wanted!"  
Do not let them say, "We have swallowed him up *and* destroyed him."  
###### 26
Let those be ashamed and humiliated together who rejoice at my distress;  
Let those be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves over me.
###### 27
Let them shout for joy and rejoice, who favor my vindication *and* want what is right for me;  
Let them say continually, "Let the LORD be magnified, who delights *and* takes pleasure in the prosperity of His servant."  
###### 28
And my tongue shall declare Your righteousness (justice),  
And Your praise all the day long.

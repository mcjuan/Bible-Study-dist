## Folly and Wickedness of Men.
###### 1
The {empty-headed} fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."  
They are corrupt *and* evil, and have committed repulsive injustice;  
There is no one who does good.  
###### 2
God has looked down from heaven upon the children of men  
To see if there is anyone who understands,  
Who seeks after God {who requires Him, who longs for Him as essential to life}.  
###### 3
Every one of them has turned aside *and* fallen away;  
Together they have become filthy *and* corrupt;  
There is no one who does good, no, not even one.
###### 4
Have workers of wickedness no knowledge *or* no understanding?  
They eat up My people *as though* they ate bread  
And have not called upon God.  
###### 5
There they were, in great terror *and* dread, where there had been no terror *or* dread;  
For God scattered the bones of him who besieged you;  
You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.  
###### 6
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  
When God restores {the fortunes of} His people,  
Let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.

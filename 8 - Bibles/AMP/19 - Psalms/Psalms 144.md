## Prayer for Rescue and Prosperity.
###### 1
Blessed be the LORD, my Rock *and* my great strength,  
Who trains my hands for war  
And my fingers for battle;  
###### 2
My {steadfast} lovingkindness and my fortress,  
My high tower and my rescuer,  
My shield and He in whom I take refuge,  
Who subdues my people under me.  
###### 3
LORD, what is man that You take notice of him?  
Or the son of man that You think of him?  
###### 4
Man is like a mere breath;  
His days are like a shadow that passes away.
###### 5
Bow Your heavens, O LORD, and come down;  
Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.  
###### 6
Flash lightning and scatter my enemies;  
Send out Your arrows and confuse *and* embarrass *and* frustrate them.  
###### 7
Stretch out Your hand from above;  
Set me free and rescue me from great waters,  
Out of the hands of {hostile} foreigners {who surround us}  
###### 8
Whose mouths speak deceit {without restraint},  
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
###### 9
I will sing a new song to You, O God;  
Upon a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,  
###### 10
Who gives salvation to kings,  
Who sets David His servant free from the evil sword.  
###### 11
Set me free and rescue me from the hand of {hostile} foreigners,  
Whose mouth speaks deceit {without restraint},  
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
###### 12
Let our sons in their youth be like plants full grown,  
And our daughters like corner pillars fashioned for a palace;  
###### 13
Let our barns be full, supplying every kind of produce,  
And our flocks bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;  
###### 14
Let our cattle bear  
Without mishap and without loss,  
And let there be no outcry in our streets!  
###### 15
How blessed *and* favored are the people in such circumstance;  
How blessed {fortunate, prosperous, and favored} are the people whose God is the LORD!

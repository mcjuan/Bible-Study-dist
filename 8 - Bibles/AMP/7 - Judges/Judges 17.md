## Micah's Idolatry
###### 1
There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah.  
###### 2
And he said to his mother, "The eleven hundred *pieces* of silver which were taken from you, about which you cursed {the thief} and also spoke about in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son before the LORD."  
###### 3
He returned the eleven hundred *pieces* of silver to his mother, and she said, "I had truly dedicated the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son (in his name) to make an image {carved from wood and plated with silver} and a cast image {of solid silver}; so now, I will return it to you."  
###### 4
So when he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred *pieces* of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made of it an image {of silver-plated wood} and a cast image {of solid silver}; and they were in the house of Micah.  
###### 5
Now the man Micah had a house of gods (shrine), and he made an ephod and teraphim and dedicated *and* installed one of his sons, who became his {personal} priest.  
###### 6
In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.
###### 7
Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the family {of the tribe} of Judah, who was a [^a]Levite; and he was staying there {temporarily}.  
###### 8
Then the man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he could find *a place*; and as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.  
###### 9
Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I can find *a place*."  
###### 10
And Micah said to him, "Live here with me and be a father and a {personal} priest to me, and I will give you ten *pieces* of silver each year, a supply of clothing, and your sustenance (room and board)." So the Levite went in.  
###### 11
The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to Micah like one of his sons.  
###### 12
So Micah dedicated (installed) the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah.  
###### 13
Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will favor me *and* make me prosper because I have a Levite as my priest."

## The Lovers Speak
###### 1
"Oh, that you were like a brother to me,  
Who nursed at the breasts of my mother.  
If I found you out of doors, I would kiss you;  
No one would blame me *or* despise me, either.  
###### 2
"I would lead you and bring you  
Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me;  
I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates.  
###### 3
"Let his left hand be under my head  
And his right hand embrace me."
###### 4
"I command you to take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,  
That you do not rouse nor awaken my love  
Until she pleases."
###### 5
"Who is this coming up from the wilderness  
Leaning upon her beloved?"
"Under the apple tree I awakened you {to my love};  
There your mother was in labor with you,  
There she was in labor and gave you birth.  
###### 6
"Put me like a seal on your heart,  
Like a seal on your arm;  
For love is as strong as death,  
Jealousy is as severe *and* cruel as Sheol (the place of the dead).  
Its flashes are flashes of fire,  
{A most vehement flame} the very flame of the [^a]LORD!  
###### 7
"Many waters cannot quench love,  
Nor can rivers drown it.  
If a man would offer all the riches of his house for love,  
It would be utterly scorned *and* despised."
###### 8
"We have a little sister  
And she has no breasts.  
What shall we do for our sister  
On the day when she is spoken for {in marriage}?  
###### 9
"If she is a wall (discreet, womanly),  
We will build on her a turret (dowry) of silver;  
But if she is a door (bold, flirtatious),  
We will enclose her with planks of cedar."
###### 10
"I was a wall, and my breasts were like the towers.  
Then I became in the king's eyes  
As one {to be respected and allowed} to find peace.  
###### 11
"Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;  
He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers;  
Each one was to bring him a thousand *shekels* of silver for its fruit.  
###### 12
"My very own vineyard is at my disposal;  
The thousand {shekels of silver} are for you, O Solomon,  
And two hundred are for those who tend the fruit."
###### 13
"O you who sit in the gardens,  
My companions are listening for your voice--  
Let me hear it."
###### 14
"Hurry, my beloved *and* come quickly,  
Like a gazelle or a young stag {taking me home}  
On the mountains of spices."

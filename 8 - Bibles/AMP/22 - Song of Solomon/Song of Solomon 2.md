## The Bride's Admiration
###### 1
"I am the rose {of the plain} of Sharon,  
The lily of the valleys {that grows in deep places}."
###### 2
"Like the lily among the thorns,  
So are you, my darling, among the maidens."
###### 3
"Like an apple tree {rare and welcome} among the trees of the forest,  
So is my beloved among the young men!  
In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
And his fruit was sweet *and* delicious to my palate.  
###### 4
"He has brought me to his banqueting place,  
And his banner over me is love {waving overhead to protect and comfort me}.  
###### 5
"Sustain me with raisin cakes,  
Refresh me with apples,  
Because I am sick with love.  
###### 6
"Let his left hand be under my head  
And his right hand embrace me."
###### 7
"I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,  
By the gazelles or by the does of the field {which run free},  
That you do not rouse nor awaken my love  
Until she pleases."
###### 8
"Listen! My beloved!  
Behold, he comes,  
Climbing on the mountains,  
Leaping *and* running on the hills!  
###### 9
"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.  
Behold, he is standing behind our wall,  
He is looking through the windows,  
He is gazing through the lattice.
###### 10
"My beloved speaks and says to me,  
'Arise, my love, my fair one,  
And come away.  
###### 11
'For behold, the winter is past,  
The rain is over and gone.  
###### 12
'The flowers appear on the earth once again;  
The time for singing has come,  
And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.  
###### 13
'The fig tree has budded *and* ripens her figs,  
And the vines are in blossom and give forth their fragrance.  
Arise, my love, my fair one,  
And come away {to climb the rocky steps of the hillside}.'"
###### 14
"O my dove, {here} in the clefts in the rock,  
In the sheltered *and* secret place of the steep pathway,  
Let me see your face,  
Let me hear your voice;  
For your voice is sweet,  
And your face is lovely."
###### 15
"Catch the foxes for us,  
The little foxes that spoil *and* ruin the vineyards {of love},  
While our vineyards are in blossom."
###### 16
"My beloved is mine and I am his;  
He pastures *his flock* among the lilies.  
###### 17
"Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away,  
Return quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle  
Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether {which separate us}."

## "Why should you gaze at the Shulammite,
As at the dance of the two armies?

## Admiration by the Bridegroom
###### 1
"How beautiful are your feet in sandals,  
O prince's daughter!  
The curves of your hips are like jewels,  
The work of the hands of an artist.  
###### 2
"Your navel is a round goblet  
Which never lacks mixed wine.  
Your belly is like a heap of wheat  
Surrounded with lilies.  
###### 3
"Your two breasts are like two fawns,  
The twins of a gazelle.  
###### 4
"Your neck is like a tower of ivory,  
Your eyes the {sparkling} pools of Heshbon  
By the gate of Bath-rabbim.  
Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon  
Which looks toward Damascus.  
###### 5
"Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel,  
And the flowing hair of your head like purple threads;  
I, the king, am held captive by your [^a]tresses.  
###### 6
"How beautiful and how delightful you are,  
My love, with all your delights!  
###### 7
"Your stature is like that of a palm tree  
And your breasts *like its* clusters {of dates}.  
###### 8
"I said, 'I will climb the palm tree;  
I will grasp its branches.  
Let your breasts be like clusters of the grapevine,  
And the fragrance of your breath like apples,  
###### 9
'And your kisses like the best wine!'"
"It goes *down* smoothly *and* sweetly for my beloved,  
Gliding gently over his lips while he sleeps.

## The Union of Love
###### 10
"I am my beloved's,  
And his desire is for me.  
###### 11
"Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country,  
Let us spend the night in the villages.  
###### 12
"Let us go out early to the vineyards;  
Let us see whether the vine has budded  
*And its* blossoms have opened,  
*And whether* the pomegranates have flowered.  
There I will give you my love.  
###### 13
"The mandrakes give forth fragrance,  
And over our doors are all {kinds of} choice *fruits*,  
Both new and old,  
Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.

## Mutual Delight in Each Other
###### 1
"Where has your beloved gone,  
O most beautiful among women?  
Where is your beloved hiding himself,  
That we may seek him with you?"
###### 2
"My beloved has gone down to his garden,  
To the beds of balsam,  
To feed *his flock* in the gardens  
And gather lilies.  
###### 3
"I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine,  
He who feeds *his flock* among the lilies."
###### 4
"You are as beautiful as [^a]Tirzah, my darling,  
As lovely as Jerusalem,  
As majestic as an army with banners!  
###### 5
"Turn your {flashing} eyes away from me,  
For they have confused *and* overcome me;  
Your hair is like {the shimmering black fleece of} a flock of {Arabian} goats  
That have descended from Mount Gilead.  
###### 6
"Your teeth are like a flock of ewes  
Which have come up from their washing,  
All of which bear twins,  
And not one among them has lost her young.  
###### 7
"Your temples are like a slice of the pomegranate  
Behind your veil.  
###### 8
"There are sixty queens and eighty [^b]concubines,  
And maidens without number;  
###### 9
But my dove, my perfect one, stands alone {above them all};  
She is her mother's only *daughter*;  
She is the pure *child* of the one who bore her.  
The maidens saw her and called her blessed *and* happy,  
The queens and the concubines also, and they praised her, *saying*,
###### 10
'Who is this that looks down like the dawn,  
Fair *and* beautiful as the full moon,  
Clear *and* pure as the sun,  
As majestic as an army with banners?'  
###### 11
"I went down to the orchard of nut trees  
To see the flowers of the valley,  
To see whether the grapevine had budded  
And the pomegranates were in flower.  
###### 12
"Before I was aware {of what was happening}, my desire had brought me  
Into the area of the princes of my people {the king's retinue}."
###### 13
"Return, return, O Shulammite;  
Return, return, that we may gaze at you."

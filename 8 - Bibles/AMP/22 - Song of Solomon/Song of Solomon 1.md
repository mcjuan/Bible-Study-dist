## The Young Shulammite Bride and Jerusalem's Daughters
###### 1
The [^a]Song of Songs {the best of songs}, which is Solomon's.
###### 2
"May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!" {Solomon arrives, she turns to him, saying,}  
"For your love is better than wine.  
###### 3
"The aroma of your oils is fragrant *and* pleasing;  
Your name is perfume poured out;  
Therefore the maidens love you.  
###### 4
"Draw me away with you *and* let us run *together*!  
Let the king bring me into his chambers."
"We will rejoice and be glad in you;  
We will remember *and* extol your love more {sweet and fragrant} than wine.  
Rightly do they love you."
###### 5
"I am deeply tanned but lovely,  
O daughters of Jerusalem,  
{I am dark} like the tents of {the Bedouins of} Kedar,  
Like the {beautiful} curtains of Solomon.  
###### 6
"Do not gaze at me because I am deeply tanned,  
{I have worked in} the sun; it has left its mark on me.  
My mother's sons were angry with me;  
They made me keeper of the vineyards,  
But my own vineyard (my complexion) I have not kept."  
###### 7
"Tell me, O you whom my soul loves,  
Where do you pasture *your flock*,  
Where do you make it lie down at noon?  
For why should I be like one who is veiled  
Beside the flocks of your companions?"

## Solomon, the Lover, Speaks
###### 8
"If you do not know {where your lover is},  
O you fairest among women,  
Run along, follow the tracks of the flock,  
And pasture your young goats  
By the tents of the shepherds.
###### 9
"To me, my love, you are like  
My {favorite} mare among the chariots of Pharaoh.  
###### 10
"Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments,  
Your neck with strings of jewels."
###### 11
"We will make for you chains *and* ornaments of gold,  
{Studded} with beads of silver."
###### 12
"While the king was at his table,  
My perfume (Solomon) sent forth {his} fragrance {surrounding me}.  
###### 13
"My beloved is to me like a pouch of myrrh  
Which lies all night between my breasts.  
###### 14
"My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers  
In the {fragrant} vineyards of [^d]Engedi."
###### 15
"Behold, how beautiful you are, my darling,  
Behold, how beautiful you are!  
Your eyes are dove's eyes."
###### 16
"Behold, how fair *and* handsome you are, my beloved;  
*And* so delightful!  
Our arbor is green *and* luxuriant.  
###### 17
"The beams of our houses are cedars,  
Our rafters *and* panels are cypresses.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Song of Solomon 1:1 Some theologians believe the Song of Solomon to be a collection of songs, but it is more generally understood to be a sort of drama or lyric poem celebrating the wholesomeness of a growing love that leads to maturity in marriage. The ancient rabbis understood it as an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel, and viewed the details as symbolic.
[^b]: Song of Solomon 1:2 The parenthetical headings indicate that the speakers are not from the Hebrew text nor the Septuagint, but reflect an ancient tradition which appears in some manuscripts.
[^c]: Song of Solomon 1:5 The purpose of the chorus is to echo and expand the sentiments of the bride and her bridegroom. The members of the chorus are not always known, but have been variously identified as “daughters of Jerusalem,” “daughters of Zion,” “ladies in waiting,” “friends” or “relatives” of the bride.
[^d]: Song of Solomon 1:14 An oasis on the western side of the Dead Sea.

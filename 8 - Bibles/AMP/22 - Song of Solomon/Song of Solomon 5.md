## The Torment of Separation
###### 1
"I have come into my garden, my sister, my {promised} bride;  
I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam *and* spice {from your sweet words}.  
I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;  
I have drunk my wine with my milk.  
Eat, friends;  
Drink and drink deeply, O lovers."
###### 2
"I was asleep, but my heart was awake.  
A voice {in my dream}! My beloved was knocking:  
'Open to me, my sister, my darling,  
My dove, my perfect one!  
For my head is drenched with the {heavy night} dew;  
My hair {is covered} with the dampness of the night.'  
###### 3
"I had taken off my dress,  
How can I put it on *again*?  
I had washed my feet,  
How could I get them dirty *again*?  
###### 4
"My beloved extended his hand through the opening {of the door},  
And my feelings were aroused for him.  
###### 5
"I arose to open for my beloved;  
And my hands dripped with myrrh,  
And my fingers with liquid {sweet-scented} myrrh,  
On the handles of the bolt.  
###### 6
"I opened for my beloved,  
But my beloved had turned away and was gone.  
My heart went out *to him* when he spoke.  
I searched for him, but I could not find him;  
I called him, but he did not answer me.  
###### 7
"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me.  
They struck me, they wounded me;  
The guardsmen of the walls took my shawl from me.  
###### 8
"I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,  
If you find my beloved,  
As to what you tell him--  
{Say that} I am sick from love {sick from being without him}."
###### 9
"What is your beloved more than another beloved,  
O most beautiful among women?  
What is your beloved more than another beloved,  
That you should so command us to take an oath?"

## Admiration by the Bride
###### 10
"My beloved is exquisitely handsome and ruddy,  
Outstanding among ten thousand.  
###### 11
"His head is *like* {precious} gold, pure gold;  
His hair is {curly} *like* clusters of dates  
And black as a raven.  
###### 12
"His eyes are like doves  
Beside streams of water,  
Bathed in milk  
And reposed in their setting.  
###### 13
"His cheeks are like a bed of balsam,  
Banks of sweet, fragrant herbs.  
His lips are lilies  
Dripping *sweet-scented* myrrh.  
###### 14
"His hands are rods of gold  
Set with beryl;  
His abdomen is a figure of carved ivory  
Inlaid with sapphires.  
###### 15
"His legs are {strong and steady} pillars of alabaster  
Set upon pedestals of fine gold.  
His appearance is like Lebanon,  
Stately *and* choice as the cedars.  
###### 16
"His mouth is *full of* sweetness;  
Yes, he is altogether lovely *and* desirable.  
This is my beloved and this is my friend,  
O daughters of Jerusalem."

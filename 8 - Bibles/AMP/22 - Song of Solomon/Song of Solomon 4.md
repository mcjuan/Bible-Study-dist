## Solomon's Love Expressed
###### 1
"How fair *and* beautiful you are, my darling,  
How very beautiful!  
Your eyes behind your veil are like those of a dove;  
Your hair is like {the shimmering black fleece of} a flock of {Arabian} goats  
That have descended from Mount Gilead {beyond the Jordan}.  
###### 2
"Your teeth are like a flock of *newly* shorn ewes  
Which have come up from washing,  
All of which bear twins,  
And not one among them has lost her young.  
###### 3
"Your lips are like a ribbon of scarlet,  
And your mouth is lovely.  
Your temples are like a slice of the pomegranate  
Behind your veil.  
###### 4
"Your neck is like the tower of David,  
Built with rows of {glistening} stones,  
Whereon hang a thousand shields,  
All of them shields of warriors.  
###### 5
"Your two breasts are like two fawns,  
Twins of a gazelle  
Which feed among the lilies.  
###### 6
"Until the day breaks  
And the shadows flee away,  
{In my thoughts} I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh  
And to the hill of frankincense.
###### 7
"O my love, you are altogether beautiful *and* fair.  
There is no flaw *nor* blemish in you!  
###### 8
"*Come away* with me from Lebanon, my {promised} bride,  
May you come with me from Lebanon.  
Journey down from the top of Amana,  
From the summit of Senir and Hermon,  
From the dens of lions,  
From the mountains of leopards.  
###### 9
"You have ravished my heart *and* given me courage, my sister, my {promised} bride;  
You have ravished my heart *and* given me courage with a single *glance* of your eyes,  
With one jewel of your necklace.  
###### 10
"How beautiful is your love, my sister, my {promised} bride!  
How much better is your love than wine,  
And the fragrance of your oils  
Than all *kinds* of balsam *and* spices.  
###### 11
"Your lips, my {promised} bride, drip honey {as the honeycomb};  
Honey and milk are under your tongue,  
And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.  
###### 12
"A garden enclosed is my sister, my {promised} bride--  
A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up.  
###### 13
"Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates,  
{A paradise} with precious fruits, henna with fragrant plants,  
###### 14
Fragrant plants and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,  
With all trees of frankincense,  
Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices.  
###### 15
"*You are* a fountain in a garden,  
A well of fresh *and* living water,  
And streams *flowing* from Lebanon."
###### 16
"Awake, O north *wind*,  
And come, south *wind* {blow softly upon my garden};  
Make my garden breathe out *fragrance*, {for the one in whom my soul delights},  
Let its spices flow forth.  
Let my beloved come into his garden  
And eat its choicest fruits."

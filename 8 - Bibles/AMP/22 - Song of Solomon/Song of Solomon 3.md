## The Bride's Troubled Dream
###### 1
"On my bed night after night {I dreamed that} I sought the one  
Whom my soul loves;  
I sought him but did not find him.  
###### 2
"*I said* 'So I must arise now and go out into the city;  
Into the streets and into the squares {places I do not know}  
I must seek him whom my soul loves.'  
I sought him but I did not find him.  
###### 3
"The watchmen who go around the city found me,  
*And I said*, 'Have you seen him whom my soul loves?'  
###### 4
"Scarcely had I passed them  
When I found him whom my soul loves.  
I held on to him and would not let him go  
Until I had brought him to my mother's house,  
And into the chamber of her who conceived me."
###### 5
"I command that you take an oath, O daughters of Jerusalem,  
By the gazelles or by the does of the field,  
That you do not rouse nor awaken my love  
Until she pleases."

## Solomon's Wedding Day
###### 6
"What is this coming up from the wilderness  
Like {stately} pillars of smoke  
Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,  
With all the fragrant powders of the merchant?"
###### 7
"Behold, it is the couch ([^a]palanquin) of Solomon;  
Sixty mighty men around it,  
Of the mighty men of Israel.  
###### 8
"All of them handle the sword,  
All expert in war;  
Each man has his sword at his thigh,  
*Guarding* against the terrors of the night.  
###### 9
"King Solomon has made for himself a palanquin  
From the {cedar} wood of Lebanon.  
###### 10
"He made its posts of silver,  
Its back of gold,  
Its seat of purple cloth,  
The interior lovingly *and* intricately wrought  
By the daughters of Jerusalem.  
###### 11
"Go forth, O daughters of Zion,  
And gaze on King Solomon wearing the crown  
With which his mother {Bathsheba} has crowned him  
On the day of his wedding,  
On the day of his gladness of heart."

## Asa Succeeds Abijah in Judah
###### 1
So[^a] Abijah slept with his fathers {in death}, and they buried him in the City of David; and Asa his son became king in his place. The land was at peace for ten years during his days.
###### 2
Asa[^b] did what was good and right in the sight of the LORD his God.
###### 3
He removed the foreign altars and high places and tore down the {pagan} pillars (obelisks, memorial stones), and cut to pieces the Asherim {the symbols of the goddess Asherah}.  
###### 4
And he commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers {to inquire of and for Him and seek Him as a vital necessity}, and to observe the law {given to Moses} and the commandment.  
###### 5
Asa also removed the {idolatrous} high places and the incense altars from all the cities of Judah. The kingdom was at rest *and* undisturbed under his reign.  
###### 6
He built fortified cities in Judah, since the land was at rest, and there was no one at war with him in those years, because the LORD had given him rest.  
###### 7
So he said to Judah, "Let us build these cities and surround them with walls, towers, gates and bars {to secure the doors}. The land is still ours because we have sought the LORD our God; we have sought Him {longing for Him with all our heart} and He has given us peace on every side." So they built and prospered.  
###### 8
Now Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah, who carried large shields and spears, and 280,000 from Benjamin, who carried shields and drew bows, all courageous men.
###### 9
Now Zerah the Ethiopian (Cushite) came out against Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots, and he came as far as Mareshah.  
###### 10
Then Asa went out against him, and they drew up in battle formation in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.  
###### 11
Asa called out to the LORD his God, saying, "O LORD, there is no one besides You to help *in the battle* between the powerful and the weak; so help us, O LORD our God, for we trust in *and* rely on You, and in Your name we have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our God; let not man prevail against You."  
###### 12
So the LORD struck the Ethiopians {with defeat} before Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians fled.  
###### 13
Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as [^c]Gerar; and so many Ethiopians fell that none of them *were found* alive; for they were destroyed before the LORD and His army. And they carried away a very large amount of spoil.  
###### 14
They attacked *and* destroyed all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of the LORD had fallen on them. They plundered all the cities, for there was a large amount of spoil in them.  
###### 15
They also struck down the people {living} in tents who had livestock, and took captive large numbers of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.

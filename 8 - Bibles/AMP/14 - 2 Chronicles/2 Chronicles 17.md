## Jehoshaphat Succeeds Asa
###### 1
Jehoshaphat his son then became king {of Judah} in Asa's place, and strengthened his position over Israel.  
###### 2
He placed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim which his father Asa had captured.

## His Good Reign
###### 3
The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he [^a]followed the example of his father (ancestor) David. He did not seek {to follow} the Baals {the false gods},  
###### 4
but sought the God of his father, and walked in (obeyed) His commandments, and did not act as Israel did.  
###### 5
Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honor.  
###### 6
His heart was encouraged *and* he took great pride in the ways of the LORD; moreover, he again removed the high places {of pagan worship} and the Asherim from Judah.
###### 7
Then in the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;  
###### 8
and with them were the Levites--Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with them the priests Elishama and Jehoram.  
###### 9
They taught in Judah *having* the Book of the Law of the LORD with them; they went throughout all the cities of Judah and taught among the people.
###### 10
Now the dread of the LORD was on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.  
###### 11
Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat; the Arabians also brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats.  
###### 12
So Jehoshaphat became greater and greater. He built fortresses and storage cities in Judah.  
###### 13
He had large supplies in the cities of Judah, and soldiers, courageous men, in Jerusalem.  
###### 14
This was the number of them by their fathers' (ancestors') households: of Judah, the commanders of thousands, Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 courageous men;  
###### 15
and next to him was Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000;  
###### 16
and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who volunteered for the LORD, and with him 200,000 courageous men;  
###### 17
and of Benjamin: Eliada, a brave man, and with him 200,000 men armed with bow and shield;  
###### 18
and next to him was Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed *and* ready for military service.  
###### 19
These are the ones who were in the service of the king, besides those he had placed in fortified cities throughout Judah.

## Jotham Succeeds Uzziah in Judah
###### 1
Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.  
###### 2
He did right in the sight of the LORD, in accordance with everything that his father Uzziah had done; however, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people continued behaving corruptly.  
###### 3
He built the upper gate of the house of the LORD, and did extensive building on the wall of Ophel.  
###### 4
Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built fortresses and towers.  
###### 5
He also fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed over them. As a result the Ammonites gave him during that year a hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures each of wheat and of barley. The Ammonites also paid him that much in the second year and third year.  
###### 6
So Jotham grew powerful, because he directed his ways before the LORD his God.  
###### 7
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

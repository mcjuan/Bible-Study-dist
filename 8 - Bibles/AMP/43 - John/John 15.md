## Jesus Is the Vine--Followers Are Branches
###### 1
"[^a]I am the true Vine, and My Father is the vinedresser.  
###### 2
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every *branch* that continues to bear fruit, He {repeatedly} prunes, so that it will bear more fruit {even richer and finer fruit}.  
###### 3
You are already clean because of the word which I have given you {the teachings which I have discussed with you}.  
###### 4
Remain in Me, and I {will remain} in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself without remaining in the vine, neither can you {bear fruit, producing evidence of your faith} unless you remain in Me.  
###### 5
I[^b] am the Vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him bears much fruit, for {otherwise} apart from Me {that is, cut off from vital union with Me} you can do nothing.
###### 6
If anyone does not remain in Me, he is thrown out like a {broken off} branch, and withers *and* dies; and they gather such branches and throw them into the fire, and they are burned.  
###### 7
If you remain in Me and My words remain in you {that is, if we are vitally united and My message lives in your heart}, ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you.  
###### 8
My Father is glorified *and* honored by this, when you bear much fruit, and prove yourselves to be My {true} disciples.  
###### 9
I have loved you just as the Father has loved Me; remain in My love {and do not doubt My love for you}.  
###### 10
If you keep My commandments *and* obey My teaching, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love.  
###### 11
I have told you these things so that My joy *and* delight may be in you, and that your joy may be made full *and* complete *and* overflowing.

## Disciples' Relation to Each Other
###### 12
"This is My commandment, that you [^c]love *and* unselfishly seek the best for one another, just as I have loved you.  
###### 13
No one has greater love {nor stronger commitment} than to lay down his own life for his friends.  
###### 14
You are my friends if you keep on doing what I command you.  
###### 15
I do not call you servants any longer, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you {My} friends, because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from My Father.  
###### 16
You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you and I have appointed *and* placed *and* purposefully planted you, so that you would go and bear fruit *and* keep on bearing, and that your fruit will remain *and* be lasting, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name {as My representative} He may give to you.  
###### 17
This {is what} I command you: that you love *and* unselfishly seek the best for one another.

## Disciples' Relation to the World
###### 18
"If the world hates you {and it does}, know that it has hated Me before *it hated* you.  
###### 19
If you belonged to the world, the world would love {you as} its own *and* would treat you with affection. But you are not of the world {you no longer belong to it}, but I have chosen you out of the world. And because of this the world hates you.  
###### 20
Remember {and continue to remember} that I told you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.  
###### 21
But they will do all these {hurtful} things to you for My name's sake {because you bear My name and are identified with Me}, for they do not know the One who sent Me.  
###### 22
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have {the guilt of their} sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.  
###### 23
The one who hates Me also hates My Father.  
###### 24
If I had not done among them the works (attesting miracles) which no one else {ever} did, they would not have {the guilt of their} sin; but now {the fact is that} they have both seen {these works} and have hated Me {and continue to hate Me} and My Father as well.  
###### 25
But {this is so} that the word which has been written in their Law would be fulfilled, 'They hated Me without a cause.'
###### 26
"But when the [^d]Helper (Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor--Counselor, Strengthener, Standby) comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, *that is* the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, He will testify *and* bear witness about Me.  
###### 27
But you will testify also *and* be My witnesses, because you have been with Me from the beginning.

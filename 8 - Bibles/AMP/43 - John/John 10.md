## Parable of the Good Shepherd
###### 1
"I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, he who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up from some other place {on the stone wall}, that one is a thief and a robber.  
###### 2
But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep {the protector and provider}.  
###### 3
The [^a]doorkeeper opens {the gate} for this man, and the sheep hear his voice *and* pay attention to it. And {knowing that they listen} he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out {to pasture}.  
###### 4
When he has brought all his own *sheep* outside, he walks on ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice *and* recognize his call.  
###### 5
They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers."  
###### 6
Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand what He was talking about.
###### 7
So Jesus said again, "I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, I am [^b]the Door for the sheep {leading to life}.  
###### 8
All who came before Me {as false messiahs and self-appointed leaders} are thieves and robbers, but the {true} sheep did not hear them.  
###### 9
I am the Door; anyone who enters through Me will be saved {and will live forever}, and will go in and out {freely}, and find pasture (spiritual security).  
###### 10
The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have *and* enjoy life, and have it in abundance {to the full, till it overflows}.
###### 11
I[^c] am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd [^d]lays down His {own} life for the sheep.
###### 12
But the hired man {who merely serves for wages}, who is neither the shepherd nor the owner of the sheep, when he sees the wolf coming, deserts the flock and runs away; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters *them*.  
###### 13
The *man runs* because he is a hired hand {who serves only for wages} and is not concerned about the {safety of the} sheep.  
###### 14
I am the Good Shepherd, and I know {without any doubt those who are} My own and My own know Me {and have a deep, personal relationship with Me}--  
###### 15
even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father--and I lay down My {very own} life {sacrificing it} for *the benefit of* the sheep.  
###### 16
I have [^e]other sheep {beside these} that are not of this fold. I must bring those also, and they will listen to My voice *and* pay attention to My call, and they will become [^f]one flock with one Shepherd.  
###### 17
For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My {own} life so that I may take it back.  
###### 18
No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down voluntarily. I am authorized *and* have power to lay it down *and* to give it up, and I am authorized *and* have power to take it back. This command I have received from My Father."
###### 19
A division {of opinion} occurred again among the Jews because of these words {of His}.  
###### 20
Many of them said, "He has a demon and He is mad {insane--He raves and rambles}. Why listen to Him?"  
###### 21
Others were saying, "These are not the words *and* thoughts of one possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"

## Jesus Asserts His Deity
###### 22
At that time the [^g]Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem.  
###### 23
It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple {area} in [^h]Solomon's portico.  
###### 24
So the Jews surrounded Him and began saying to Him, "How long are You going to keep us in suspense? If You are {really} the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed), tell us so plainly *and* openly."  
###### 25
Jesus answered them, "I have told you so, yet you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name testify concerning Me {they are My credentials and the evidence declaring who I am}.  
###### 26
But you do not believe Me {so you do not trust and follow Me} because you are not My sheep.  
###### 27
The sheep that are My own hear My voice *and* listen to Me; I know them, and they follow Me.  
###### 28
And I give them eternal life, and they will never, ever {by any means} perish; and no one will ever snatch them out of My hand.  
###### 29
My[^i] Father, who has given *them* to Me, is greater *and* mightier than all; and no one is able to snatch *them* out of the Father's hand.
###### 30
I and the Father are One {in essence and nature}."
###### 31
Again the Jews picked up stones to stone Him.  
###### 32
Jesus answered them, "I showed you many good works {and many acts of mercy} from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?"  
###### 33
The Jews answered Him, "We are not going to stone You for a good work, but for blasphemy, because You, a *mere* man, make Yourself out to be God."  
###### 34
Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods {human judges representing God, not divine beings}'?  
###### 35
If He [^j]called them gods, men to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be undone *or* annulled *or* broken),  
###### 36
{if that is true} then do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified *and* set apart *for Himself* and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?  
###### 37
If I do not do the works of My Father {that is, the miracles that only God could perform}, then do not believe Me.  
###### 38
But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe Me *or* have faith in Me, {at least} believe the works {that I do--admit that they are the works of God}, so that you may know and keep on knowing {clearly--without any doubt} that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father {that is, I am One with Him}."  
###### 39
So they tried again to seize Him, but He eluded their grasp.
###### 40
He went back again across the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He was staying there.  
###### 41
Many came to Him, and they were saying, "John did not perform a single sign (attesting miracle), but everything John said about this Man was true *and* accurate."  
###### 42
And many there believed *and* confidently trusted in Him {accepting Him as Savior, and following His teaching}.

[^h]: John 10:23 Located on the east side of the temple, this was a sheltered area consisting of a long, covered portico or colonnade. It later became a meeting place for Christians (Acts 3:11; 5:12).
[^i]: John 10:29 One early ms reads *What My Father has given Me is greater than all*.
[^j]: John 10:35 This statement in Ps 82:6 is addressed to the ruling judges of Israel, who were supposed to serve as God’s representatives on earth.

## The Death of Moses
###### 1
Now[^a] Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, from Gilead to Dan,
###### 2
and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the western sea (Mediterranean Sea),  
###### 3
and the Negev (South country) and the plain in the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar.  
###### 4
Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."  
###### 5
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.  
###### 6
And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows where his burial place is to this day.  
###### 7
Although Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eyesight was not dim, nor his natural strength abated.  
###### 8
So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
###### 9
Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD commanded Moses.  
###### 10
Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,  
###### 11
{none equal to him} in all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land,  
###### 12
and in all the mighty power and all the great *and* terrible deeds which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.

## Solomon's Officials
###### 1
King Solomon was king over all {the people of} Israel.  
###### 2
These were his {chief} officials: Azariah the [^a]son of Zadok was the *high* priest;

Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha, were scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder {of important events};

Azariah the son of Nathan was in charge of the deputies; Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and was the king's friend {and trusted advisor};  
###### 6
Ahishar was in charge of the household (palace); and Adoniram the son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor.
###### 7
Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who [^b]secured provisions for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year.  
###### 8
These were their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of {the tribe of} Ephraim;  
###### 9
Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elon-beth-hanan;  
###### 10

## Solomon's Power, Wealth and Wisdom
###### 20
{The people of} Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand that is in abundance by the sea; they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
###### 21
Now[^c] Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms from the {Euphrates} River to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute (money) and served Solomon all the days of his life.
###### 22
Solomon's food {for the royal household} for one day was thirty [^d]kors of finely milled flour, sixty kors of wheat flour,  
###### 23
ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep not counting fallow deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl.  
###### 24
For he was ruling over everything west of the {Euphrates} River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the {Euphrates} River; and he had peace on all sides around him.  
###### 25
Judah and Israel lived in security, every man under his vine and fig tree {in peace and prosperity}, from Dan {in the north} to Beersheba {in the south}, during all the days of Solomon.  
###### 26
Solomon also had [^e]40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen.  
###### 27
Those deputies provided food for King Solomon and for all {the staff} who came to King Solomon's table, each in his month; they let nothing be lacking.  
###### 28
They also brought the barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds (warhorses, chargers) to the place where it was needed, each man according to his assignment.
###### 29
Now God gave Solomon {exceptional} wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand of the seashore.  
###### 30
Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt.  
###### 31
For he was wiser [^f]than all {other} men, {wiser} than [^g]Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. His fame was *known* in all the surrounding nations.  
###### 32
He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005.  
###### 33
He spoke of trees, from the cedar which is in Lebanon to the hyssop {vine} that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and fish.  
###### 34
People came from all the peoples (nations) to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.

[^c]: 1 Kings 4:21 In the Hebrew text ch 5 begins with this verse.
[^d]: 1 Kings 4:22 This was the largest unit of volume, but the actual amount varied because it was based on the volume of an egg, the basic Jewish standard of volume.

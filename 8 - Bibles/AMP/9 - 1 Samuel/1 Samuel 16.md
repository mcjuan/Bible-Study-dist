## Samuel Goes to Bethlehem
###### 1
The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve for Saul, when I have rejected him as king over Israel? [^a]Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for Myself among his sons."  
###### 2
But Samuel said, "How can I go? When Saul hears *about it*, he will kill me." And the LORD said, "Take a heifer from the herd with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.'  
###### 3
You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do {after that}; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate."  
###### 4
So Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, "Do you come in peace?"  
###### 5
And he said, "In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
###### 6
So it happened, when they had come, he looked at Eliab {the eldest son} and thought, "Surely the Lord's anointed is before Him."  
###### 7
But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks [^b]at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."  
###### 8
Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."  
###### 9
Next Jesse had Shammah pass by. And Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen him either."  
###### 10
Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen {any of} these."  
###### 11
Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" Jesse replied, "There is still one left, the youngest; he is tending the sheep." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send *word* and bring him; because we will not sit down {to eat the sacrificial meal} until he comes here."

## David Anointed
###### 12
So Jesse sent *word* and brought him in. Now he had a ruddy complexion, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. The LORD said {to Samuel}, "Arise, anoint him; for this is he."  
###### 13
Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.
###### 14
Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented *and* terrified him.  
###### 15
Saul's servants said to him, "Behold, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.  
###### 16
Let our lord now command your servants who are here before you to find a man who plays skillfully on the harp; and when the evil spirit from God is on you, he shall play *the harp* with his hand, and you will be well."  
###### 17
So Saul told his servants, "Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me."  
###### 18
One of the young men said, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a brave *and* competent man, a warrior, discerning (prudent, eloquent) in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him."  
###### 19
So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me David your son, who is with the flock."  
###### 20
Jesse took a donkey {loaded with} bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent them to Saul with David his son.  
###### 21
Then David came to Saul and attended him. Saul loved him greatly and {later} David became his armor bearer.  
###### 22
Saul sent *word* to Jesse, saying, "Please let David [^c]be my attendant, for he has found favor in my sight."  
###### 23
So it came about that whenever the {evil} spirit from God was on Saul, David took a harp and played it with his hand; so Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would leave him.

## Elkanah and His Wives
###### 1
There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the [^a]hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an [^b]Ephraimite.  
###### 2
He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
###### 3
This man went up from his city [^c]each year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh. Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests to the LORD there.  
###### 4
When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions {of the sacrificial meat} to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters.  
###### 5
But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the LORD had [^d]given her no children.  
###### 6
Hannah's rival provoked her bitterly, to irritate *and* embarrass her, because the LORD had [^e]left her childless.  
###### 7
So it happened year after year, whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah provoked her; so she wept and would not eat.  
###### 8
Then Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you cry and why do you not eat? Why are you so sad *and* discontent? Am I not better to you than ten sons?"
###### 9
So Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside the doorpost of the temple (tabernacle) of the LORD.  
###### 10
Hannah was [^f]greatly distressed, and she prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish.  
###### 11
She made a vow, saying, "O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction (suffering) of Your maidservant and remember, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life; a [^g]razor shall never touch his head."
###### 12
Now it happened as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth.  
###### 13
Hannah was speaking in her heart (mind); only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, so Eli [^h]thought she was drunk.  
###### 14
Eli said to her, "How long will you make yourself drunk? Get rid of your wine."  
###### 15
But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman with a despairing spirit. I have not been drinking wine or *any* intoxicating drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD.  
###### 16
Do not regard your maidservant as a wicked *and* worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and {bitter} provocation."  
###### 17
Then Eli answered and said, "Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him."  
###### 18
Hannah said, "Let your maidservant find grace *and* favor in your sight." So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer *sad*.

## Samuel Is Born to Hannah
###### 19
The family got up early the next morning, worshiped before the LORD, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her {prayer}.  
###### 20
It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; she named him [^i]Samuel, *saying*, "Because I have asked for him from the LORD."
###### 21
Then the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the [^j]yearly sacrifice and *pay* his vow.  
###### 22
But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "*I will not go up* until the child is [^k]weaned; and then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and remain there as long as he lives."  
###### 23
Elkanah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish *and* confirm His word." So the woman remained {behind} and nursed her son until she weaned him.  
###### 24
Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a [^l]leather bottle of wine {to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet fragrance}, and she brought Samuel to the Lord's house in Shiloh, although the child was young.  
###### 25
Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the child to Eli.  
###### 26
Hannah said, "Oh, my lord! As {surely as} your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to the LORD.  
###### 27
For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my request which I asked of Him.  
###### 28
Therefore I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD." And they worshiped the LORD there.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 Samuel 1:1 Lit *mountains of*.
[^b]: 1 Samuel 1:1 It is sometimes claimed that Samuel was from the tribe of Ephraim (rather than the tribe of Levi) and so was not eligible to serve as a priest. He was an Ephraimite only in the sense that his family lived in the tribal area of Ephraim. His genealogy is given in 1 Chr 6:22-28. At least two other men in the passage are named Elkanah. Samuel’s father, Elkanah, is the man mentioned in 1 Chr 6:27. The men mentioned in 1 Chr 6:23, 24, and 26 are several generations removed from Samuel.
[^c]: 1 Samuel 1:3 Lit *from days to days*.
[^d]: 1 Samuel 1:5 Lit *closed her womb*.
[^e]: 1 Samuel 1:6 Lit *closed her womb*.
[^f]: 1 Samuel 1:10 Lit *bitter of soul*.
[^g]: 1 Samuel 1:11 Lit *shearing knife*. This was a requirement of a Nazirite vow which would apply to Samuel all of his life (see Num 6:2 ff).
[^h]: 1 Samuel 1:13 This implies that the custom at that time was to pray aloud; the outcome (vv 19, 20) shows that God hears prayer, whether it is spoken or silent.
[^i]: 1 Samuel 1:20 The name possibly means “The Name {i.e. Yahweh, Lord} is God” or “His name is God,” but the etymology is uncertain.
[^j]: 1 Samuel 1:21 Lit *sacrifice of days*.
[^k]: 1 Samuel 1:22 At this time children were nursed until about age three. But it may be fair to say that Hannah also wanted to keep the boy as long as she reasonably could; giving up her only child—even for the best of purposes—must have been terribly difficult.
[^l]: 1 Samuel 1:24 These containers were made from almost the entire skin of an animal and were used for holding wine.

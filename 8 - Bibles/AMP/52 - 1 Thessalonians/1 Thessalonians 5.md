## The Day of the Lord
###### 1
Now as to the [^a]times and dates, [^b]brothers and sisters, you have no need for anything to be written to you.  
###### 2
For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the {return of the} Lord is coming just as a thief {comes unexpectedly and suddenly} in the night.  
###### 3
While they are saying, "Peace and safety {all is well and secure!}" then {in a moment unforeseen} destruction will come upon them suddenly like labor pains on a woman with child, and they will absolutely not escape {for there will be no way to escape the judgment of the Lord}.  
###### 4
But you, [^c]believers, {all you who believe in Christ as Savior and acknowledge Him as God's Son} are not in *spiritual* darkness {nor held by its power}, that the day {of judgment} would overtake you {by surprise} like a thief;  
###### 5
for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We do not belong to the night nor to darkness.  
###### 6
So then let us not sleep {in spiritual indifference} as the rest {of the world does}, but let us keep wide awake {alert and cautious} and let us be sober {self-controlled, calm, and wise}.  
###### 7
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk get drunk at night.  
###### 8
But since we {believers} belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope *and* confident assurance of salvation.  
###### 9
For God has not destined us to {incur His} wrath {that is, He did not select us to condemn us}, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,  
###### 10
who died {willingly} for us, so that whether we are awake (alive) or asleep (dead) {at Christ's appearing}, we will live together with Him {sharing eternal life}.  
###### 11
Therefore encourage *and* comfort one another and build up one another, just as you are doing.

## Christian Conduct
###### 12
Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to appreciate those who diligently work among you {recognize, acknowledge, and respect your leaders}, who are in charge over you in the Lord and who give you instruction,  
###### 13
and {we ask that you appreciate them and} hold them in the highest esteem in love because of their work {on your behalf}. Live in peace with one another.  
###### 14
We {earnestly} urge you, believers, admonish those who are out of line {the undisciplined, the unruly, the disorderly}, encourage the timid {who lack spiritual courage}, help the {spiritually} weak, be very patient with everyone {always controlling your temper}.  
###### 15
See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek that which is good for one another and for all people.  
###### 16
Rejoice always *and* delight in your faith;  
###### 17
be unceasing *and* persistent in prayer;  
###### 18
in every situation {no matter what the circumstances} be thankful *and* continually give thanks *to God*; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.  
###### 19
Do not quench {subdue, or be unresponsive to the working and guidance of} the {Holy} Spirit.  
###### 20
Do not scorn *or* reject gifts of prophecy *or* prophecies {spoken revelations--words of instruction or exhortation or warning}.  
###### 21
But test [^d]all things carefully {so you can recognize what is good}. Hold firmly to that which is good.  
###### 22
Abstain from every form of evil {withdraw and keep away from it}.
###### 23
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you through and through {that is, separate you from profane and vulgar things, make you pure and whole and undamaged--consecrated to Him--set apart for His purpose}; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete and {be found} blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
###### 24
Faithful *and* absolutely trustworthy is He who is calling you {to Himself for your salvation}, and He will do it {He will fulfill His call by making you holy, guarding you, watching over you, and protecting you as His own}.
###### 25
Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
###### 26
Greet all the believers with a holy [^e]kiss {as brothers and sisters in God's family}.  
###### 27
I solemnly charge you by the Lord to have this letter read before all the [^f]congregation.
###### 28
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

## Thanksgiving for These Believers
###### 1
Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy,
To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace {inner calm and spiritual well-being from God}.
###### 2
We give thanks to God always for all of you, *continually* mentioning you in our prayers;  
###### 3
recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith, and your service motivated by love and unwavering hope in {the return of} our Lord Jesus Christ.  
###### 4
Brothers[^a] and sisters beloved by God, we know that He has chosen you;
###### 5
for our good news {regarding salvation} came to you not only in word, but also in {its inherent} power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction {on our part}. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your benefit.  
###### 6
You became imitators of us and {through us} of the Lord, after you welcomed our message in {a time of} great trouble with the joy supplied by the Holy Spirit;  
###### 7
so that you became an example to all the believers in [^b]Macedonia and in Achaia.  
###### 8
For the word of the Lord has resounded from you *and* has echoed {like thunder}, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place {the news of} your {great} faith in God has spread, so that we never need to say anything about it.  
###### 9
For they themselves report about us, *telling* what kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,  
###### 10
and to {look forward and confidently} wait for {the coming of} His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead--Jesus, who {personally} rescues us from the coming wrath {and draws us to Himself, granting us all the privileges and rewards of a new life with Him}.

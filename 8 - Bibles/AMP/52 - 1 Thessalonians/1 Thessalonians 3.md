## Encouragement of Timothy's Visit
###### 1
Therefore, when we could no longer endure our separation {from you}, we thought it best to be left behind, alone at Athens,  
###### 2
and so we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in {spreading} the good news of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you {exhorting, comforting, and establishing you} in regard to your faith,  
###### 3
so that no one would be unsettled by these difficulties {to which I have referred}. For you know that we have been destined for this {as something unavoidable in our position}.  
###### 4
For even when we were with you, we warned you plainly in advance that we were going to experience persecution; and so, as you know, it has come to pass.  
###### 5
For this reason, when I could no longer endure the suspense, I sent *someone* to find out about your faith {how you were holding up under pressure}, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our work {among you} would prove to be ineffective.
###### 6
But now that Timothy has come back to us from {his visit with} you, and has brought us good news of your {steadfast} faith and {the warmth of your} love, and {reported} that you always think kindly of us *and* treasure your memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you,  
###### 7
for this reason, brothers and sisters, during all our distress and suffering we have been comforted *and* greatly encouraged about you because of your faith {your unwavering trust in God--placing yourselves completely in His loving hands};  
###### 8
because now we *really* live {in spite of everything}, if you stand firm in the Lord.  
###### 9
For what {adequate} thanks can we offer to God for you in return for all the joy *and* delight we have before our God on your account?  
###### 10
We continue to pray night and day most earnestly that we may see you face to face, and may complete whatever may be imperfect *and* lacking in your faith.
###### 11
Now may our God and Father Himself, and Jesus our Lord guide our steps to you {by removing the obstacles that stand in our way}.  
###### 12
And may the Lord cause you to increase and excel *and* overflow in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you;  
###### 13
so that He may strengthen *and* establish your hearts without blame in holiness in the sight of our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His [^a]saints (God's people).

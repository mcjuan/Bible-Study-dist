## Paul's Ministry
###### 1
For you know, brothers and sisters, that our coming to you has not been ineffective (fruitless, in vain),  
###### 2
but after we had already suffered and been outrageously treated in Philippi, as you know, yet in {the strength of} our God we summoned the courage to proclaim boldly to you the good news of God {regarding salvation} amid great opposition.  
###### 3
For our appeal does not *come* from delusion or impure motives, nor {is it motivated} by deceit {our message is complete, accurate, and based on the truth--it does not change}.  
###### 4
But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel {that tells the good news of salvation through faith in Christ}, so we speak, not as {if we were trying} to please people {to gain power and popularity}, but *to please* God who examines our hearts {expecting our best}.  
###### 5
For as you well know, we never came with words of flattery nor with a pretext for greed--God is our witness--  
###### 6
nor did we seek glory *and* honor from people, neither from you nor from anyone else, though as apostles of Christ we had the power to assert our authority.  
###### 7
But we behaved gently when we were among you, like a devoted *mother* tenderly caring for her own children.  
###### 8
Having such a deep affection for you, we [^a]were delighted to share with you not only God's good news but also our own lives, because you had become so very dear to us.
###### 9
For you remember, [^b]believers, our labor and hardship. We worked night and day {practicing our trade} in order not to be a {financial} burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you.  
###### 10
You are witnesses, and so is God, how unworldly and just and blameless was our behavior toward you who believe {in our Lord Jesus Christ}.  
###### 11
For you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you just as a father does {in dealing with} his own children, {guiding you}  
###### 12
to live lives {of honor, moral courage, and personal integrity} worthy of the God who {saves you and} calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
###### 13
And we also thank God continually for this, that when you received the word of God {concerning salvation} which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of {mere} men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is effectually at work in you who believe {exercising its inherent, supernatural power in those of faith}.  
###### 14
For you, [^c]brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you too suffered the same {kind of} persecution from your own countrymen, as they did from the Jews,  
###### 15
who [^d]killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and harassed *and* drove us out; and {they} continue to be highly displeasing to God and {to show themselves} hostile to all people,  
###### 16
forbidding us from speaking to the Gentiles (non-Jews) so that they may be saved. So, as always, they fill up {to the brim} the measure of their sins {allotted to them by God}. But {God's} wrath has come upon them at last {completely and forever}.
###### 17
But since we were taken away from you, believers, for a little while--in person, but not in heart--we endeavored, with great longing to see you face to face.  
###### 18
For we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, again and again {wanted to come}, but Satan hindered us.  
###### 19
For who is {the object of} our hope or joy or our victor's wreath of triumphant celebration {when we stand} in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?  
###### 20
For you are {indeed} our glory and our joy!

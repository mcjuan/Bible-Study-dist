## God's Indictment of His People
###### 1
Hear now what the LORD is saying,  
"Arise, plead your case before the mountains,  
And let the hills {as witnesses} hear your voice.  
###### 2
"Hear, O mountains, the indictment of the LORD,  
And you enduring foundations of the earth,  
For the LORD has a case (a legal complaint) against His people,  
And He will dispute (challenge) Israel.  
###### 3
"O My people, what have I done to you {since you have turned away from Me}?  
And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.  
###### 4
"For I brought you up from the land of Egypt  
And ransomed you from the house of slavery,  
And I sent before you Moses {to lead you}, Aaron {the high priest}, and Miriam {the prophetess}.  
###### 5
"My people, remember now  
What Balak king of Moab devised {with his evil plan against Israel}  
And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him {turning the curse into blessing for Israel},  
{Remember what the LORD did for you} from [^a]Shittim to Gilgal,  
So that you may know the righteous *and* saving acts {displaying the power} of the LORD."

## What God Requires of Man
###### 6
With what shall I come before the LORD {to honor Him}  
And bow myself before God on high?  
Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,  
With yearling calves?  
###### 7
Will the LORD be delighted with thousands of rams,  
Or with ten thousand rivers of oil?  
Shall I present my firstborn for my acts of rebellion,  
The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?  
###### 8
He has told you, O man, what is good;  
And what does the LORD require of you  
Except to be just, and to love {and to diligently practice} kindness (compassion),  
And to walk humbly with your God {setting aside any overblown sense of importance or self-righteousness}?
###### 9
The voice of the LORD shall call to the city {of Jerusalem}--  
And it is sound wisdom to heed {solemnly} *and* fear Your name {with awe-filled reverence};  
"Hear, O tribe {the rod of punishment}. Who has appointed its time?  
###### 10
"Are there not still treasures gained by wickedness  
In the house of the wicked,  
And a short (inaccurate) measure {for grain} *that is* cursed?  
###### 11
"Can I {be guiltless and} justify deceptive scales  
And a bag of dishonest weights?  
###### 12
"For the rich men of the city are full of violence {of every kind};  
Her inhabitants speak lies  
And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.  
###### 13
"So also I will make you sick, striking you down,  
Desolating *and* devastating you, because of your sins.  
###### 14
"You shall eat, but you will not be satisfied,  
And your [^b]emptiness shall be among you;  
You will {try to} remove {your goods and those you love} *for safekeeping*  
But you will fail to save *anything*,  
And what you do save I shall give to the sword.  
###### 15
"You shall sow but you shall not reap;  
You shall tread olives, but shall not anoint yourself with oil,  
And {you will extract juice from} the grapes, but you shall not drink the wine.  
###### 16
"For {you have kept} the statutes of Omri {the idolatrous king},  
And all the works of the {wicked} house (dynasty) of Ahab;  
And you walk in their counsels *and* policies.  
Therefore, I shall hand you over for destruction *and* horror  
And your {city's} inhabitants for ridicule,  
And you shall bear the rebuke *and* scorn of My people."

### Footnotes
[^a]: Micah 6:5 God reminds His people of His gracious acts in their behalf—how Balak tried to oppose Israel through pagan rites, sending for Balaam to put a curse on the Israelites; how God saved Israel by causing Balaam to bless instead of curse them; and how God later led them across the Jordan River into the promised land, from Shittim (Josh 3:1) to Gilgal (Josh 4:19).
[^b]: Micah 6:14 Or possibly *garbage* or *vileness*.

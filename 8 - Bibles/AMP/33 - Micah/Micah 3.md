## Rulers Denounced
###### 1
And I said,
"Hear now, heads of Jacob  
And rulers of the house of Israel.  
Is it not for you to know *and* administer justice?  
###### 2
"You who hate good and love evil,  
Who tear the skin off my people  
And their flesh from their bones;  
###### 3
You who eat the flesh of my people,  
Strip off their skin from them,  
Break their bones  
And chop them in pieces as for the pot,  
Like meat in a kettle."  
###### 4
Then they will cry to the LORD,  
But He will not answer them;  
Instead, He will even hide His face from them at that time {withholding His mercy}  
Because they have practiced *and* tolerated *and* ignored evil acts.
###### 5
Thus says the LORD concerning the {false} prophets who lead my people astray;
When they have *something good* to bite with their teeth,  
They call out, "Peace,"  
But against the one who gives them nothing to eat,  
They declare a holy war.  
###### 6
Therefore *it will* be night (tragedy) for you--without vision,  
And darkness (cataclysm) for you--without foresight.  
The sun shall go down on the {false} prophets,  
And the day shall become dark *and* black over them.  
###### 7
The seers shall be ashamed  
And the diviners discredited *and* embarrassed;  
Indeed, they shall all cover their mouths {in shame}  
Because there is no answer from God.  
###### 8
But in fact, I am filled with power,  
With the Spirit of the LORD,  
And with justice and might,  
To declare to Jacob his transgression  
And to Israel his sin.  
###### 9
Now hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob  
And rulers of the house of Israel,  
Who hate *and* reject justice  
And twist everything that is straight,  
###### 10
Who build Zion with blood {and extortion and murder}  
And Jerusalem with violent injustice.  
###### 11
Her leaders pronounce judgment for a bribe,  
Her priests teach for a fee,  
And her prophets foretell for money;  
Yet they lean on the LORD, saying,  
"Is not the LORD among us?  
No tragedy *or* distress will come on us."  
###### 12
Therefore, on account of you  
Zion[^a] shall be plowed like a field,
Jerusalem shall become [^b]a heap of ruins,  
And the mountain of the house {of the LORD} *shall become* like a densely wooded hill.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Micah 3:12 Zion (City of David) was the elevated area between the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys (southeastern area of Jerusalem during the time of Jesus). The city was the capital of Israel (the united kingdom) during the reigns of David and Solomon, and the site of Solomon’s temple.
[^b]: Micah 3:12 In 586 b.c. Jerusalem (including Solomon’s temple) was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ruler of Babylon (Chaldean Dynasty).

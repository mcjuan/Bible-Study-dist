## Misuse of Riches
###### 1
Come {quickly} now, you rich {who lack true faith and hoard and misuse your resources}, weep and howl over the miseries {the woes, the judgments} that are coming upon you.  
###### 2
Your wealth has rotted *and* is ruined and your {fine} clothes have become moth-eaten.  
###### 3
Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have stored up your treasure in the last days {when it will do you no good}.  
###### 4
Look! The wages that you have {fraudulently} withheld from the laborers who have mowed your fields are crying out {against you for vengeance}; and the cries of the harvesters have come to the ears of [^a]the Lord of Sabaoth.  
###### 5
On the earth you have lived luxuriously *and* abandoned yourselves to soft living and led a life of wanton pleasure {self-indulgence, self-gratification}; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.  
###### 6
You have condemned and have put to death the righteous *man*; he offers you no resistance.

## Exhortation
###### 7
So wait patiently, brothers and sisters, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits {expectantly} for the precious harvest from the land, being patient about it, until it receives the early and late rains.  
###### 8
You too, be patient; strengthen your hearts {keep them energized and firmly committed to God}, because the coming of the Lord is near.  
###### 9
Do not complain against one another, believers, so that you will not be judged {for it}. Look! The Judge is standing [^b]right at the door.  
###### 10
As an example, brothers and sisters, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord {as His messengers and representatives}.  
###### 11
You know we call those blessed {happy, spiritually prosperous, favored by God} who were steadfast *and* endured {difficult circumstances}. You have heard of the *patient* endurance of Job and you have seen the Lord's outcome {how He richly blessed Job}. The Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.
###### 12
But above all, my fellow believers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but let your yes be {a truthful} yes, and your no be {a truthful} no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
###### 13
Is anyone among you suffering? He must pray. Is anyone joyful? He is to sing praises {to God}.  
###### 14
Is anyone among you sick? He must call for the elders (spiritual leaders) of the church and they are to pray over him, anointing him with [^c]oil in the name of the Lord;  
###### 15
and the prayer of faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.  
###### 16
Therefore, confess your sins to one another {your false steps, your offenses}, and pray for one another, that you may be healed *and* restored. The heartfelt *and* persistent prayer of a righteous man (believer) can accomplish much {when put into action and made effective by God--it is dynamic and can have tremendous power}.  
###### 17
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours {with the same physical, mental, and spiritual limitations and shortcomings}, and he prayed [^d]intensely for it not to rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.  
###### 18
Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its crops {as usual}.
###### 19
My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you strays from the truth *and* falls into error and {another} one turns him back {to God},  
###### 20
let the {latter} one know that the one who has turned a sinner from the error of his way will save that one's soul from death and cover a multitude of sins {that is, obtain the pardon of the many sins committed by the one who has been restored}.

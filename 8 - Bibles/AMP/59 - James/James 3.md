## The Tongue Is a Fire
###### 1
Not many {of you} should become teachers {serving in an official teaching capacity}, my brothers and sisters, for you know that we {who are teachers} will [^a]be judged by a higher standard {because we have assumed greater accountability and more condemnation if we teach incorrectly}.  
###### 2
For we all stumble *and* sin in many *ways*. If anyone does not stumble in what he says {never saying the wrong thing}, he is a perfect man {fully developed in character, without serious flaws}, able to bridle his whole body *and* rein in his entire nature {taming his human faults and weaknesses}.  
###### 3
Now if we put bits into the horses' mouths to make them obey us, we guide their whole body as well.  
###### 4
And look at the ships. Even though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman determines.  
###### 5
In the same sense, the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things.
See {by comparison} how great a forest is set on fire by a small spark!  
###### 6
And the tongue is {in a sense} a fire, the *very* world of injustice *and* unrighteousness; the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the entire body, and sets on fire the course of our life {the cycle of man's existence}, and is itself set on fire by [^b]hell (Gehenna).  
###### 7
For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.  
###### 8
But no one can tame the *human* tongue; it is a restless evil {undisciplined, unstable}, full of deadly poison.  
###### 9
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God.  
###### 10
Out of the same mouth come *both* blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, should not be this way {for we have a moral obligation to speak in a manner that reflects our fear of God and profound respect for His precepts}.  
###### 11
Does a spring send out from the same opening *both* [^c]fresh and bitter *water*?  
###### 12
Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce [^d]fresh.

## Wisdom from Above
###### 13
Who among you is wise and intelligent? Let him by his good conduct show his {good} deeds with the gentleness *and* humility of *true* wisdom.  
###### 14
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not be arrogant, and {as a result} be in defiance of the truth.  
###### 15
This {superficial} wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly (secular), natural (unspiritual), *even* demonic.  
###### 16
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder {unrest, rebellion} and every evil thing *and* morally degrading practice.  
###### 17
But the wisdom from above is first pure {morally and spiritually undefiled}, then peace-loving {courteous, considerate}, gentle, reasonable {and willing to listen}, full of compassion and good fruits. It is unwavering, without {self-righteous} hypocrisy {and self-serving guile}.  
###### 18
And the seed whose fruit is righteousness (spiritual maturity) is sown in peace by those who make peace {by actively encouraging goodwill between individuals}.

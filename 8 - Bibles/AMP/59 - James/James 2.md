## The Sin of Partiality
###### 1
My fellow believers, do not practice your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with *an attitude* of partiality {toward people--show no favoritism, no prejudice, no snobbery}.  
###### 2
For if a man comes into your [^a]meeting place [^b]wearing a gold ring and [^c]fine clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in,  
###### 3
and you pay special attention to the one who wears the [^d]fine clothes, and say to him, "You sit here in this good seat," and you tell the poor man, "You stand over there, or sit down {on the floor} by my footstool,"  
###### 4
have you not discriminated among yourselves, and become judges with wrong motives?  
###### 5
Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and {as believers to be} heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?  
###### 6
But you {in contrast} have dishonored the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress *and* exploit you, and personally drag you into the courts of law?  
###### 7
Do they not blaspheme the [^e]precious name {of Christ} by which you are called?
###### 8
If, however, you are {really} fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself {that is, if you have an unselfish concern for others and do things for their benefit}" you are doing well.  
###### 9
But if you show partiality {prejudice, favoritism}, you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as offenders.  
###### 10
For whoever keeps the whole Law but stumbles in one *point*, he has become guilty of {breaking} all of it.  
###### 11
For He who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become [^f]guilty of transgressing the {entire} Law.  
###### 12
Speak and act {consistently} as people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty {that moral law that frees obedient Christians from the bondage of sin}.  
###### 13
For judgment *will be* merciless to one who has shown no mercy; but {to the one who has shown mercy} mercy triumphs {victoriously} over judgment.

## Faith and Works
###### 14
What is the benefit, my fellow believers, if someone claims to have faith but has no {good} works {as evidence}? Can that {kind of} faith save him? {No, a mere claim of faith is not sufficient--genuine faith produces good works.}  
###### 15
If a brother or sister is without {adequate} clothing and lacks {enough} food for each day,  
###### 16
and one of you says to them, "Go in peace {with my blessing}, {keep} warm and feed yourselves," but he does not give them the necessities for the body, what good does that do?  
###### 17
So too, faith, if it does not have works {to back it up}, is by itself dead {inoperative and ineffective}.
###### 18
But someone may say, "You {claim to} have faith and I have {good} works; show me your {alleged} faith without the works {if you can}, and I will show you my faith by my works {that is, by what I do}."  
###### 19
You believe that [^g]God is one; you do well {to believe that}. The demons also believe {that}, and shudder *and* bristle {in awe-filled terror--they have seen His wrath}!  
###### 20
But are you willing to recognize, you foolish {spiritually shallow} person, that faith without {good} works is useless?  
###### 21
Was our father Abraham not {shown to be} justified by works {of obedience which expressed his faith} when he offered Isaac his son on the altar {as a sacrifice to God}?  
###### 22
You see that {his} faith was working together with his works, and as a result of the works, his faith was completed {reaching its maturity when he expressed his faith through obedience}.  
###### 23
And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and this {faith} was credited to him {by God} as righteousness *and* as conformity to His will," and he was called the friend of God.  
###### 24
You see that a man (believer) is justified by works and not by faith alone {that is, by acts of obedience a born-again believer reveals his faith}.  
###### 25
In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not justified by works too, when she received the {Hebrew} [^h]spies as guests *and* protected them, and sent them away {to escape} by a different route?  
###### 26
For just as the {human} body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works {of obedience} is also dead.

## Judgment on Neighboring Nations
###### 1
The words of Amos, who was among the sheepherders of [^a]Tekoa, which he saw {in a divine revelation} concerning [^b]Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
###### 2
And he said,  
"The LORD thunders *and* roars from Zion {in judgment}  
And utters His voice from Jerusalem;  
Then the pastures of the shepherds mourn,  
And the summit of {Mount} Carmel dries up {because of God's judgment}."
###### 3
Thus says the LORD,  
"For three transgressions of Damascus and for four (multiplied delinquencies)  
I shall not reverse its punishment *or* revoke My word concerning it,  
Because they have threshed Gilead {east of the Jordan River} with sharp iron sledges {having spikes that crushed and shredded}.  
###### 4
"So I will send a fire {of war, conquest, and destruction} upon the house of [^c]Hazael,  
And it shall devour the palaces *and* strongholds of [^d]Ben-hadad (Hazael's son).  
###### 5
"I also will break the bar {of the gate} of Damascus,  
And cut off *and* destroy the inhabitant from the Valley of Aven (Wickedness),  
And the ruler who holds the scepter, from Beth-eden (Damascus);  
And the people of Aram {conquered by the Assyrians} will go into exile to [^e]Kir,"  
Says the LORD.
###### 6
Thus says the LORD,  
"For three transgressions of Gaza {in Philistia} and for four (multiplied delinquencies)  
I will not reverse its punishment *or* revoke My word concerning it,  
Because {as slave traders} they took captive the entire {Jewish} population {of defenseless Judean border villages, of which none was spared}  
And deported them to Edom {for the slave trade}.  
###### 7
"So I will send a fire {of war, conquest, and destruction} on the wall of Gaza  
And it shall consume her citadels.  
###### 8
"And I will cut off *and* destroy the inhabitants from Ashdod,  
And the ruler who holds the scepter, from Ashkelon;  
And I will unleash My power *and* turn My hand {in judgment} against Ekron,  
And the rest of the Philistines {in Gath and the towns dependent on these four Philistine cities} shall die,"  
Says the Lord God.
###### 9
Thus says the LORD,  
"For three transgressions of Tyre and for four (multiplied delinquencies)  
I will not reverse its punishment *or* revoke My word concerning it,  
Because they {as middlemen} deported an entire {Jewish} population to Edom  
And did not {seriously} remember their covenant of brotherhood.  
###### 10
"So I will send a fire {of war, conquest, and destruction} on the wall of Tyre,  
And it shall consume her citadels."
###### 11
Thus says the LORD,  
"For three transgressions of Edom {the descendants of Esau} and for four (multiplied delinquencies)  
I will not reverse its punishment *or* revoke My word concerning it,  
Because he pursued his brother Jacob (Israel) with the sword,  
Corrupting *and* stifling his compassions *and* casting off all mercy;  
His destructive anger raged continually,  
And he maintained {and nurtured} his wrath forever.  
###### 12
"So I will send a fire {of war, conquest, and destruction} upon Teman,  
And it shall consume the citadels of Bozrah {in Edom}."
###### 13
Thus says the LORD,  
"For three transgressions of the children of [^f]Ammon and for four (multiplied delinquencies)  
I will not reverse its punishment *or* revoke My word concerning it,  
Because the Ammonites have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead,  
That they might enlarge their border.  
###### 14
"So I will kindle a fire {of war, conquest, and destruction} on the wall of Rabbah {in Ammon}  
And it shall devour its strongholds  
Amid war cries *and* shouts of alarm on the day of battle,  
And a tempest on the day of the whirlwind {when the enemy captures the city}.  
###### 15
"Their king shall go into exile,  
He and his princes together," says the LORD.

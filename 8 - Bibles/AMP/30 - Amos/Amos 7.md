## Warning Through Visions
###### 1
Thus the Lord God showed me {a vision}, and behold, He was forming a swarm of locusts when the spring crop began to sprout. And behold, the spring crop was after the king's mowing.  
###### 2
And when the locusts had finished eating the plants of the land, then I said,
"O Lord God, please forgive!  
How can Jacob stand,  
For he is so small {that he cannot endure this}?"  
###### 3
The LORD revoked this sentence.  
"It shall not take place," said the LORD.
###### 4
Thus the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God called for punishment with fire, and it devoured the great deep {underground sources of water} and began to consume the land.  
###### 5
Then I said,
"O Lord God, please stop!  
How can Jacob stand,  
For he is so small {that he cannot endure this}?"  
###### 6
The LORD revoked this sentence.  
"This also shall not be," said the Lord God.
###### 7
Thus He showed me {a vision}, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand {to determine if the wall was straight or if it needed to be destroyed}.  
###### 8
The LORD said to me, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A plumb line." Then the Lord said,
"Behold, I am setting a plumb line {as a standard}  
Among My people Israel {showing the defectiveness of the nation, requiring judgment}.  
I shall not spare them any longer. {The door of mercy is shut.}  
###### 9
"And the {idolatrous} high places of Isaac (Israel) will be devastated *and* deserted,  
And the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins.  
Then I shall rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword {and destroy the monarchy}."

## Amos Accused, Answers
###### 10
Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel {site of the golden calf shrine}, sent *word* to [^a]Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, "Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words.  
###### 11
For in this way Amos has said, 'Jeroboam will die by the sword and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.'"  
###### 12
Then Amaziah said to Amos, "Go, you seer, run for your life {from Israel} to the land of Judah {your own country} and eat bread and live as a prophet there!  
###### 13
But do not prophesy any longer at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary and a royal residence."
###### 14
Then Amos replied to Amaziah, "I am not a prophet {by profession}, nor am I a prophet's son; I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs.  
###### 15
But the LORD took me as I followed the flock and the LORD said to me, 'Go, prophesy to My people Israel.'  
###### 16
Now therefore, listen to the word of the LORD: You say, 'You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you speak against the house of Isaac.'  
###### 17
Therefore, thus says the LORD, 'Your wife shall become a prostitute in the city {when the [^b]Assyrians capture Samaria} and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by a measuring line; you yourself shall die in an unclean *and* defiled {pagan} land, and Israel shall certainly go from its land into exile.'"

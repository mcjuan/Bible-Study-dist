## Salutation
###### 1
Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen ones and {to lead and encourage them to recognize and pursue} the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness,  
###### 2
based on the hope *and* divine guarantee of eternal life, {the life} which God, who is ever truthful *and* without deceit, promised before the ages of time began,  
###### 3
and at the appointed time has made known His word *and* revealed it as His message, through preaching, which was entrusted to me according to the command of God our Savior--
###### 4
To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace {inner calm and spiritual well-being} from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

## Qualifications of Elders
###### 5
For this reason I left you *behind* in Crete, so that you would set right what remains *unfinished*, and appoint [^a]elders in every city as I directed you,  
###### 6
*namely*, a man of unquestionable integrity, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of being immoral or rebellious.  
###### 7
For the [^b]overseer, as God's steward, must be blameless, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain {but financially ethical}.  
###### 8
And *he must be* hospitable {to believers, as well as strangers}, a lover of what is good, sensible (upright), fair, devout, self-disciplined {above reproach--whether in public or in private}.  
###### 9
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy word {of God} as it was taught to him, so that he will be able both to give accurate instruction in sound {reliable, error-free} doctrine and to refute those who contradict {it by explaining their error}.
###### 10
For there are many rebellious men who are empty talkers {just windbags} and deceivers; especially those of the circumcision {those Jews who insist that Gentile believers must be circumcised and keep the Law in order to be saved}.  
###### 11
They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach for the purpose of dishonest *financial* gain.  
###### 12
One of them {Epimenides, a Cretan}, a [^c]prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."  
###### 13
This description is true. So rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith *and* free from doctrinal error,  
###### 14
not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commandments *and* rules of men who turn their backs on the truth.  
###### 15
To the pure, all things are pure; but to the corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their mind and their conscience are corrupted.  
###### 16
They profess to know God {to recognize and be acquainted with Him}, but by *their* actions they deny *and* disown Him. They are detestable and disobedient and worthless for good work of any kind.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Titus 1:5 The words *elder, overseer, and bishop* are used interchangeably to indicate the spiritually mature men who were qualified and selected to serve as leaders and shepherds over the church of God (v 7; cf Acts 20:17,28; 1 Tim 3:1-7; 1 Pet 5:1, 2).
[^b]: Titus 1:7 Or *bishop*.
[^c]: Titus 1:12 Epimenides was a highly regarded sixth century b.c. poet and philosopher from Crete. His description of his own people had by this time become a proverb.

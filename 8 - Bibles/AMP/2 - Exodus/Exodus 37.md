## Construction Continues
###### 1
Bezalel made the ark {of the covenant} of acacia wood--it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high.  
###### 2
And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a molding (border) of gold to go all around {the top of it}.  
###### 3
He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.  
###### 4
He made carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.  
###### 5
He put the carrying poles through the rings at the sides of the ark, to carry it.  
###### 6
Bezalel made the mercy seat of pure gold; it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide.  
###### 7
He made two cherubim of hammered gold; he made them at the two ends of the mercy seat,  
###### 8
one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim {of one piece} with the mercy seat at the two ends.  
###### 9
The cherubim spread out their wings upward, covering *and* protecting the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were {looking downward} toward the mercy seat.
###### 10
Bezalel made the table {for the bread} of acacia wood; it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.  
###### 11
He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a border of gold for it all around {its top}.  
###### 12
He made a rim for it {just under the top} a hand width wide all around, and a border of gold around its rim.  
###### 13
He cast four rings of gold for it and fastened the rings to the four corners that were at its four legs.  
###### 14
Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles {to pass through} to carry the table.  
###### 15
Bezalel made the carrying poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold.  
###### 16
He made the utensils which were to be on the table, its dishes and its pans {for bread}, its bowls and its jars for pouring drink offerings, of pure gold.
###### 17
Then he made the lampstand (menorah) of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its {center} shaft; its cups, its [^a]calyxes, and its flowers were *all of one piece* with it.  
###### 18
There were six branches coming out of the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side of *the center shaft* and three branches from the other side of it;  
###### 19
three cups shaped like almond *blossoms*, a calyx and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond *blossoms*, a calyx and a flower in the opposite branch--so for the six branches coming out of *the center shaft of* the lampstand.  
###### 20
On *the center shaft of* the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond *blossoms*, with calyxes and flowers {one at the top};  
###### 21
and a calyx was under the *first* pair of branches *coming* out of it, and a calyx under the *second* pair of branches, *coming* out of it, and a calyx under the *third* pair of branches *coming* out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand.  
###### 22
Their calyxes and their branches were *of one piece* with it; all of it was a single hammered work of pure gold.  
###### 23
He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold.  
###### 24
He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.
###### 25
Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood; its top was a cubit square and it was two cubits high; the horns were *of one piece* with it.  
###### 26
He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides all around and its horns; he also made a rim of gold around it.  
###### 27
He made two rings of gold for it under its rim, on its two opposite sides, as holders for the poles {to pass through} to carry it.  
###### 28
He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.  
###### 29
He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.

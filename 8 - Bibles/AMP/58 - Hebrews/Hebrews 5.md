## The Perfect High Priest
###### 1
For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed {to act} on behalf of men in things relating to God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.  
###### 2
He is able to deal gently with the *spiritually* ignorant and misguided, since he is also subject to *human* weakness;  
###### 3
and because of this {human weakness} he is required to offer *sacrifices* for sins, for himself as well as for the people.  
###### 4
And besides, one does not appropriate for himself the honor {of being high priest}, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was.
###### 5
So too Christ did not glorify Himself so as to be made a high priest, but He {was exalted and appointed by the One} who said to Him,
"You are My Son,  
Today I have begotten (fathered) You {declared Your authority and rule over the nations}";
###### 6
just as He also says in another place,
"You are a priest {appointed} forever  
According to the order of [^a]Melchizedek."
###### 7
In the days of His earthly life, Jesus offered up both {specific} petitions and {urgent} supplications {for that which He needed} with fervent crying and tears to the One who was {always} able to save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission toward God {His sinlessness and His unfailing determination to do the Father's will}.  
###### 8
Although He was a Son {who had never been disobedient to the Father}, He learned {active, special} obedience through what He suffered.  
###### 9
And having been made perfect {uniquely equipped and prepared as Savior and retaining His integrity amid opposition}, He became the source of eternal salvation {an eternal inheritance} to all those who obey Him,  
###### 10
being designated by God as High Priest according to the order of [^b]Melchizedek.
###### 11
Concerning this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull *and* sluggish in {your spiritual} hearing *and* disinclined to listen.  
###### 12
For though by this time you ought to be teachers {because of the time you have had to learn these truths}, you actually need someone to teach you again the elementary principles of God's word {from the beginning}, and you have come to be *continually* in need of milk, not solid food.  
###### 13
For everyone who lives on milk is {doctrinally inexperienced and} unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a *spiritual* infant.  
###### 14
But solid food is for the {spiritually} mature, whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between what is morally good and *what is* evil.

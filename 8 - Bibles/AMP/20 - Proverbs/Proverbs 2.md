## The Pursuit of Wisdom Brings Security
###### 1
My son, if you will receive my words  
And treasure my commandments within you,  
###### 2
So that your ear is attentive to {skillful and godly} wisdom,  
And apply your heart to understanding {seeking it conscientiously and striving for it eagerly};  
###### 3
Yes, if you cry out for insight,  
And lift up your voice for understanding;  
###### 4
If you seek skillful *and* godly wisdom as you would silver  
And search for her as you would hidden treasures;  
###### 5
Then you will understand the {reverent} fear of the LORD {that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome}  
And discover the knowledge of God.  
###### 6
For the LORD gives {skillful and godly} wisdom;  
From His mouth come knowledge and understanding.  
###### 7
He stores away sound wisdom for the righteous {those who are in right standing with Him};  
*He is* a shield to those who walk in integrity {those of honorable character and moral courage},  
###### 8
He guards the paths of justice;  
And He preserves the way of His saints (believers).  
###### 9
Then you will understand righteousness and justice {in every circumstance}  
And integrity and every good path.  
###### 10
For {skillful and godly} wisdom will enter your heart  
And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.  
###### 11
Discretion will watch over you,  
Understanding *and* discernment will guard you,  
###### 12
To keep you from the way of evil *and* the evil man,  
From the man who speaks perverse things;  
###### 13
From those who leave the paths of uprightness  
To walk in the ways of darkness;  
###### 14
Who find joy in doing evil  
And delight in the perversity of evil,  
###### 15
Whose paths are crooked,  
And who are devious in their ways;  
###### 16
To keep you from the immoral woman;  
From the seductress with her flattering words,  
###### 17
Who leaves the companion (husband) of her youth,  
And forgets the covenant of her God.  
###### 18
For her house leads down to death  
And her paths lead to the dead;  
###### 19
None who go to her return again,  
Nor do they regain the paths of life--  
###### 20
So you will walk in the way of good men {that is, those of personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character},  
And keep to the paths of the righteous.  
###### 21
For the upright {those who are in right standing with God} will live in the land  
And those {of integrity} who are blameless {in God's sight} will remain in it;  
###### 22
But the wicked will be cut off from the land  
And the treacherous shall be {forcibly} uprooted *and* removed from it.

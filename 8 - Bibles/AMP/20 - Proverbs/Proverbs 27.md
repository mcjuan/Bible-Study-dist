## Warnings and Instructions
###### 1
Do not boast about tomorrow,  
For you do not know what a day may bring.  
###### 2
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;  
A stranger, and not your own lips.  
###### 3
Stone is heavy and the sand weighty,  
But a fool's {unreasonable} wrath is heavier *and* more burdensome than both of them.  
###### 4
Wrath is cruel and anger is an overwhelming flood,  
But who is able to endure *and* stand before {the sin of} jealousy?  
###### 5
Better is an open reprimand {of loving correction}  
Than love that is hidden.  
###### 6
Faithful are the wounds of a friend {who corrects out of love and concern},  
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful {because they serve his hidden agenda}.  
###### 7
He who is satisfied loathes honey,  
But to the hungry soul any bitter thing is sweet.  
###### 8
Like a bird that wanders from her nest {with its comfort and safety},  
So is a man who wanders from his home.  
###### 9
Oil and perfume make the heart glad;  
So does the sweetness of a friend's counsel that comes from the heart.  
###### 10
Do not abandon your own friend and your father's friend,  
And do not go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster.  
Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away.  
###### 11
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,  
That I may reply to him who reproaches (reprimands, criticizes) me.  
###### 12
A prudent man sees evil and hides himself *and* avoids it,  
But the naive {who are easily misled} continue on and are punished {by suffering the consequences of sin}.  
###### 13
{The judge tells the creditor,} "Take the garment of one who is surety (guarantees a loan) for a stranger;  
And hold him in pledge when he is surety for an immoral woman {for it is unlikely the debt will be repaid}."  
###### 14
He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,  
It will be counted as a curse to him {for it will either be annoying or his purpose will be suspect}.  
###### 15
A constant dripping on a day of steady rain  
And a contentious (quarrelsome) woman are alike;  
###### 16
Whoever attempts to restrain her {criticism} might as well try to stop the wind,  
And grasps oil with his right hand.  
###### 17
As iron sharpens iron,  
So one man sharpens {and influences} another {through discussion}.  
###### 18
He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit,  
And he who faithfully protects *and* cares for his master will be honored.  
###### 19
As in water face *reflects* face,  
So the heart of man reflects man.  
###### 20
Sheol (the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the underworld) are never satisfied;  
Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied.  
###### 21
The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold {to separate the impurities of the metal},  
And each is tested by the praise given to him {and his response to it, whether humble or proud}.  
###### 22
Even though you pound a {hardened, arrogant} fool {who rejects wisdom} in a mortar with a pestle like grain,  
Yet his foolishness will not leave him.
###### 23
Be diligent to know the condition of your flocks,  
And pay attention to your herds;  
###### 24
For riches are not forever,  
Nor does a crown *endure* to all generations.  
###### 25
When the grass is gone, the new growth is seen,  
And herbs of the mountain are gathered in,  
###### 26
The lambs will *supply wool* for your clothing,  
And the goats will bring the price of a field.  
###### 27
And *there will be* enough goats' milk for your food,  
For the food of your household,  
And for the maintenance of your maids.

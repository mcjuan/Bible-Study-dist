## The Usefulness of Proverbs
###### 1
The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
###### 2
To know {skillful and godly} wisdom and instruction;  
To discern *and* comprehend the words of understanding *and* insight,  
###### 3
To receive instruction in wise behavior *and* the discipline of wise thoughtfulness,  
Righteousness, justice, and integrity;  
###### 4
That prudence (good judgment, astute common sense) may be given to the naive *or* inexperienced {who are easily misled},  
And knowledge and discretion (intelligent discernment) to the youth,  
###### 5
The wise will hear and increase their learning,  
And the person of understanding will acquire wise counsel *and* the skill {to steer his course wisely and lead others to the truth},  
###### 6
To understand a proverb and a figure {of speech} *or* an enigma with its interpretation,  
And the words of the wise and their riddles {that require reflection}.
###### 7
The {reverent} fear of the LORD {that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome} is the beginning *and* the preeminent part of knowledge {its starting point and its essence};  
*But arrogant* [^a]fools despise {skillful and godly} wisdom and instruction *and* self-discipline.

## The Enticement of Sinners
###### 8
My son, hear the instruction of your father,  
And do not reject the teaching of your mother.  
###### 9
For they are a garland of grace on your head,  
And chains *and* ornaments {of gold} around your neck.  
###### 10
My son, if sinners entice you,  
Do not consent.  
###### 11
If they say, "Come with us;  
Let us lie in wait to *shed* blood,  
Let us ambush the innocent without cause;  
###### 12
Let us swallow them alive like Sheol (the place of the dead),  
Even whole, as those who go down to the pit {of death};  
###### 13
We will find *and* take all kinds of precious possessions,  
We will fill our houses with spoil;  
###### 14
Throw in your lot with us {they insist};  
We will all have one money bag {in common},"  
###### 15
My son, do not walk on the road with them;  
Keep your foot {far} away from their path,  
###### 16
For their feet run to evil,  
And they hurry to shed blood.  
###### 17
Indeed, it is useless to spread the *baited* net  
In the sight of any bird;  
###### 18
But {when these people set a trap for others} they lie in wait for their own blood;  
They set an ambush for their own lives {and rush to their destruction}.  
###### 19
So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;  
Greed takes away the lives of its possessors.

## Wisdom Warns
###### 20
Wisdom[^b] shouts in the street,
She raises her voice in the markets;  
###### 21
She calls out at the head of the noisy streets {where large crowds gather};  
At the entrance of the city gates she speaks her words:  
###### 22
"How long, O naive ones {you who are easily misled}, will you love being simple-minded *and* undiscerning?  
*How long* will scoffers {who ridicule and deride} delight in scoffing,  
*How long* will fools {who obstinately mock truth} hate knowledge?  
###### 23
"If you will turn *and* pay attention to my rebuke,  
Behold, I {Wisdom} will pour out my spirit on you;  
I will make my words known to you.  
###### 24
"Because I called and you refused {to answer},  
I stretched out my hand and no one has paid attention {to my offer};  
###### 25
And you treated all my counsel as nothing  
And would not accept my reprimand,  
###### 26
I also will laugh at your disaster;  
I will mock when your dread *and* panic come,  
###### 27
When your dread *and* panic come like a storm,  
And your disaster comes like a whirlwind,  
When anxiety and distress come upon you {as retribution}.  
###### 28
"Then they will call upon me (Wisdom), but I will not answer;  
They will seek me eagerly but they will not find me,  
###### 29
Because they hated knowledge  
And did not choose the fear of the LORD {that is, obeying Him with reverence and awe-filled respect},  
###### 30
They would not accept my counsel,  
And they spurned all my rebuke.  
###### 31
"Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own {wicked} way  
And be satiated with {the penalty of} their own devices.  
###### 32
"For the turning away of the [^c]naive will kill them,  
And the careless ease of {self-righteous} fools will destroy them.  
###### 33
"But whoever listens to me (Wisdom) will live securely *and* in confident trust  
And will be at ease, without fear *or* dread of evil."

### Footnotes
[^a]: Proverbs 1:7 In Proverbs various kinds of fools are discussed including those who are closed-minded, over-confident, and reject instruction and correction—the unteachable; those who lack spiritual insight—the spiritually blind; and those who are flippant, hardened, and who deliberately choose to reject God and wisdom—the arrogant.
[^b]: Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom is personified as a woman in vv 20-33 and speaks, in the first person, of godly wisdom. Read the word “wisdom” as “the wisdom of God” and see the wonderful power of this book.
[^c]: Proverbs 1:32 Lit *simple ones*.

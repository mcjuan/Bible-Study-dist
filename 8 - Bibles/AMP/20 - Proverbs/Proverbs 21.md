## On Life and Conduct
###### 1
The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD;  
He turns it whichever way He wishes.  
###### 2
Every man's way is right in his own eyes,  
But the LORD weighs *and* examines the hearts {of people and their motives}.  
###### 3
To do righteousness and justice  
Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice {for wrongs repeatedly committed}.  
###### 4
Haughty *and* arrogant eyes and a proud heart,  
The lamp of the wicked {their self-centered pride}, is sin {in the eyes of God}.  
###### 5
The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance *and* advantage,  
But everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty.  
###### 6
Acquiring treasures by a lying tongue  
Is a fleeting vapor, the seeking *and* pursuit of death.  
###### 7
The violence of the wicked will {return to them and} drag them away {like fish caught in a net},  
Because they refuse to act with justice.  
###### 8
The way of the guilty is {exceedingly} crooked,  
But as for the pure, his conduct is upright.  
###### 9
It is better to live in a corner of the housetop {on the flat roof, exposed to the weather}  
Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman.  
###### 10
The soul of the wicked desires evil {like an addictive substance};  
His neighbor finds no compassion in his eyes.  
###### 11
When the scoffer is punished, the naive {observes the lesson and} becomes wise;  
But when the wise *and* teachable person is instructed, he receives knowledge.  
###### 12
The righteous one keeps an eye on the house of the wicked--  
How the wicked are cast down to ruin.  
###### 13
Whoever shuts his ears at the cry of the poor  
Will cry out himself and not be answered.  
###### 14
A gift in secret subdues anger,  
And a bribe {hidden} in the pocket, strong wrath.  
###### 15
When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous (the upright, the one in right standing with God),  
But to the evildoers it is disaster.  
###### 16
A man who wanders from the way of understanding (godly wisdom)  
Will remain in the assembly of the dead.  
###### 17
He who loves {only selfish} pleasure *will become* a poor man;  
He who loves *and* is devoted to [^a]wine and {olive} oil will not become rich.  
###### 18
The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,  
And the treacherous in the place of the upright {for they fall into their own traps}.  
###### 19
It is better to dwell in a desert land  
Than with a contentious and troublesome woman.  
###### 20
There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise {who prepare for the future},  
But a short-sighted *and* foolish man swallows it up *and* wastes it.  
###### 21
He who earnestly seeks righteousness and loyalty  
Finds life, righteousness, and honor.  
###### 22
A wise man scales the city {walls} of the mighty  
And brings down the stronghold in which they trust.  
###### 23
He who guards his mouth and his tongue  
Guards himself from troubles.  
###### 24
"Proud," "Haughty," "Scoffer," are his names  
Who acts with overbearing *and* insolent pride.  
###### 25
The desire of the lazy kills him,  
For his hands refuse to labor;  
###### 26
He craves all the day long {and does no work},  
But the righteous {willingly} gives and does not withhold {what he has}.  
###### 27
The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable *and* offensive {to the LORD}.  
How much more {unacceptable and insulting can it be} when he brings it with evil intention?  
###### 28
A false witness will perish,  
But a man who listens *to the truth* will speak forever *and* go unchallenged.  
###### 29
A wicked man puts on a bold face,  
But as for the upright, he considers, directs, *and* establishes his way {with the confidence of integrity}.  
###### 30
There is no {human} wisdom or understanding  
Or counsel {that can prevail} against the LORD.  
###### 31
The horse is prepared for the day of battle,  
But deliverance *and* victory belong to the LORD.

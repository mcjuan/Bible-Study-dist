## Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
###### 1
The wise woman builds her house {on a foundation of godly precepts, and her household thrives},  
But the foolish one {who lacks spiritual insight} tears it down with her own hands {by ignoring godly principles}.  
###### 2
He who walks in uprightness {reverently} fears the LORD {and obeys and worships Him with profound respect},  
But he who is devious in his ways despises Him.  
###### 3
In the mouth of the {arrogant} [^a]fool {who rejects God} is a rod for his back,  
But the lips of the wise {when they speak with godly wisdom} will protect them.  
###### 4
Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,  
But much revenue {because of good crops} comes by the strength of the ox.  
###### 5
A faithful *and* trustworthy witness will not lie,  
But a false witness speaks lies.  
###### 6
A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none {for his ears are closed to wisdom},  
But knowledge is easy for one who understands {because he is willing to learn}.  
###### 7
Leave the presence of a {shortsighted} fool,  
For you will not find knowledge *or* hear godly wisdom from his lips.  
###### 8
The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way,  
But the foolishness of {shortsighted} fools is deceit.  
###### 9
Fools mock sin {but sin mocks the fools},  
But among the upright there is good will *and* the favor *and* blessing of God.  
###### 10
The heart knows its own bitterness,  
And no stranger shares its joy.  
###### 11
The house of the wicked will be overthrown,  
But the tent of the upright will thrive.  
###### 12
There is a way *which seems* right to a man *and* appears straight before him,  
But its end is the way of death.  
###### 13
Even in laughter the heart may be in pain,  
And the end of joy may be grief.  
###### 14
The backslider in heart will have his fill with his own {rotten} ways,  
But a good man will *be satisfied* with his ways {the godly thought and action which his heart pursues and in which he delights}.  
###### 15
The naive *or* inexperienced person {is easily misled and} believes every word he hears,  
But the prudent man {is discreet and astute and} considers well where he is going.  
###### 16
A wise man suspects danger and cautiously avoids evil,  
But the fool is arrogant and careless.  
###### 17
A quick-tempered man acts foolishly *and* without self-control,  
And a man of wicked schemes is hated.  
###### 18
The naive {are unsophisticated and easy to exploit and} inherit foolishness,  
But the sensible {are thoughtful and far-sighted and} are crowned with knowledge.  
###### 19
The evil will bow down before the good,  
And the wicked {will bow down} at the gates of the righteous.  
###### 20
The poor man is hated even by his neighbor,  
But those who love the rich are many.  
###### 21
He who despises his neighbor sins {against God and his fellow man},  
But happy {blessed and favored by God} is he who is gracious *and* merciful to the poor.  
###### 22
Do they not go astray who devise evil *and* wander from the way of righteousness?  
But kindness and truth will be to those who devise good.  
###### 23
In all labor there is profit,  
But mere talk leads only to poverty.  
###### 24
The crown of the wise is their wealth {of wisdom},  
But the foolishness of {closed-minded} fools is {nothing but} folly.  
###### 25
A truthful witness saves lives,  
But he who speaks lies is treacherous.  
###### 26
In the {reverent} fear of the LORD there is strong confidence,  
And His children will {always} have a place of refuge.  
###### 27
The {reverent} fear of the LORD {that leads to obedience and worship} is a fountain of life,  
So that one may avoid the snares of death.  
###### 28
In a multitude of people is a king's glory,  
But in a lack of people is a {pretentious} prince's ruin.  
###### 29
He who is slow to anger has great understanding {and profits from his self-control},  
But he who is quick-tempered exposes *and* exalts his foolishness {for all to see}.  
###### 30
A calm *and* peaceful *and* tranquil heart is life *and* health to the body,  
But passion *and* envy are like rottenness to the bones.  
###### 31
He who oppresses the poor taunts *and* insults his Maker,  
But he who is kind *and* merciful *and* gracious to the needy honors Him.  
###### 32
The wicked is overthrown through his wrongdoing,  
But the righteous has hope *and* confidence *and* a refuge {with God} even in death.  
###### 33
Wisdom rests {silently} in the heart of one who has understanding,  
But what is in the heart of {shortsighted} fools is made known.  
###### 34
Righteousness {moral and spiritual integrity and virtuous character} exalts a nation,  
But sin is a disgrace to any people.  
###### 35
The king's favor *and* good will are toward a servant who acts wisely *and* discreetly,  
But his anger *and* wrath are toward him who acts shamefully.

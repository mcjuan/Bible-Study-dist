## Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
###### 1
A soft *and* gentle *and* thoughtful answer turns away wrath,  
But harsh *and* painful *and* careless words stir up anger.  
###### 2
The tongue of the wise speaks knowledge that is pleasing *and* acceptable,  
But the {babbling} mouth of fools spouts folly.  
###### 3
The eyes of the LORD are in every place,  
Watching the evil and the good {in all their endeavors}.  
###### 4
A soothing tongue {speaking words that build up and encourage} is a tree of life,  
But a perversive tongue {speaking words that overwhelm and depress} crushes the spirit.  
###### 5
A {flippant, arrogant} fool rejects his father's instruction *and* correction,  
But he who {is willing to learn and} regards *and* keeps in mind a reprimand acquires good sense.  
###### 6
Great *and* priceless treasure is in the house of the {consistently} righteous one {who seeks godly instruction and grows in wisdom},  
But trouble is in the income of the wicked one {who rejects the laws of God}.  
###### 7
The lips of the wise spread knowledge {sifting it as chaff from the grain};  
But the hearts of {shortsighted} fools are not so.  
###### 8
The sacrifice of the wicked is hateful *and* exceedingly offensive to the LORD,  
But the prayer of the upright is His delight!  
###### 9
The way {of life} of the wicked is hateful *and* exceedingly offensive to the LORD,  
But He loves one who pursues righteousness {personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character}.  
###### 10
There is severe discipline for him who [^a]turns from the way {of righteousness};  
And he who hates correction will die.  
###### 11
Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the abyss, the place of eternal punishment) *lie open* before the LORD--  
How much more the hearts *and* inner motives of the children of men.  
###### 12
A scoffer {unlike a wise man} resents one who rebukes him *and* tries to teach him;  
Nor will he go to the wise {for counsel and instruction}.  
###### 13
A heart full of joy *and* goodness makes a cheerful face,  
But when a heart is full of sadness the spirit is crushed.  
###### 14
The mind of the intelligent *and* discerning seeks knowledge *and* eagerly inquires after it,  
But the mouth of the {stubborn} fool feeds on foolishness.  
###### 15
All the days of the afflicted are bad,  
But a glad heart has a continual feast {regardless of the circumstances}.  
###### 16
Better is a little with the {reverent, worshipful} fear of the LORD  
Than great treasure and trouble with it.  
###### 17
Better is a dinner of vegetables *and* herbs where love is present  
Than a fattened ox served with hatred.  
###### 18
A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,  
But he who is slow to anger *and* patient calms disputes.  
###### 19
The way of the lazy is like a hedge of thorns {it pricks, lacerates, and entangles him},  
But the way {of life} of the upright is smooth *and* open like a highway.  
###### 20
A wise son makes a father glad,  
But a foolish man despises his mother.  
###### 21
Foolishness is joy to him who is without heart *and* lacks {intelligent, common} sense,  
But a man of understanding walks uprightly {making his course straight}.  
###### 22
Without consultation *and* wise advice, plans are frustrated,  
But with many counselors they are established and succeed.  
###### 23
A man has joy in giving an appropriate answer,  
And how good *and* delightful is a word spoken at the right moment--how good it is!  
###### 24
The {chosen} path of life leads upward for the wise,  
That he may keep away from Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) below.  
###### 25
The LORD will tear down the house of the proud *and* arrogant (self-righteous),  
But He will establish *and* protect the boundaries {of the land} of the {godly} widow.  
###### 26
Evil plans *and* thoughts of the wicked are exceedingly vile *and* offensive to the LORD,  
But pure words are pleasant words to Him.  
###### 27
He who profits unlawfully brings suffering to his own house,  
But he who hates bribes {and does not receive nor pay them} will live.  
###### 28
The heart of the righteous thinks carefully about how to answer {in a wise and appropriate and timely way},  
But the {babbling} mouth of the wicked pours out malevolent things.  
###### 29
The LORD is far from the wicked {and distances Himself from them},  
But He hears the prayer of the {consistently} righteous {that is, those with spiritual integrity and moral courage}.  
###### 30
The light of the eyes rejoices the hearts of others,  
And good news puts fat on the bones.  
###### 31
The ear that listens to *and* learns from the life-giving rebuke (reprimand, censure)  
Will remain among the wise.  
###### 32
He who neglects *and* ignores instruction *and* discipline despises himself,  
But he who learns from rebuke acquires understanding {and grows in wisdom}.  
###### 33
The {reverent} fear of the LORD {that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome} is the instruction for wisdom {its starting point and its essence};  
And before honor comes humility.

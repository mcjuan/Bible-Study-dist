## Wisdom's Invitation
###### 1
Wisdom has built her {spacious and sufficient} house;  
She has hewn out *and* set up her seven pillars.  
###### 2
She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine;  
She has also set her table.  
###### 3
She has sent out her maidens, she calls  
From the highest places of the city:  
###### 4
"Whoever is naive *or* inexperienced, let him turn in here!"  
As for him who lacks understanding, she says,  
###### 5
"Come, eat my food  
And drink the wine I have mixed {and accept my gifts}.  
###### 6
"Leave {behind} your foolishness {and the foolish} and live,  
And walk in the way of insight *and* understanding."
###### 7
He who corrects *and* instructs a scoffer gets dishonor for himself,  
And he who rebukes a wicked man gets insults for himself.  
###### 8
Do[^a] not correct a scoffer {who foolishly ridicules and takes no responsibility for his error} or he will hate you;
Correct a wise man {who learns from his error}, and he will love you.  
###### 9
Give *instruction* to a wise man and he will become even wiser;  
Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning.  
###### 10
The {reverent} fear of the LORD {that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome} is the beginning *and* the preeminent part of wisdom {its starting point and its essence},  
And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding *and* spiritual insight.  
###### 11
For by me (wisdom from God) your days will be multiplied,  
And years of life shall be increased.  
###### 12
If you are wise, you are wise for yourself {for your own benefit};  
If you scoff {thoughtlessly ridicule and disdain}, you alone will pay the penalty.
###### 13
The foolish woman is restless *and* noisy;  
She is naive *and* easily misled *and* thoughtless, and knows nothing at all {of eternal value}.  
###### 14
She sits at the doorway of her house,  
On a seat by the high *and* conspicuous places of the city,  
###### 15
Calling to those who pass by,  
Who are making their paths straight:  
###### 16
"Whoever is naive *or* inexperienced, let him turn in here!"  
And to him who lacks understanding (common sense), she says,  
###### 17
"Stolen waters (pleasures) are sweet {because they are forbidden};  
And bread *eaten* in secret is pleasant."  
###### 18
But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there,  
And that her guests are {already} in the depths of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead).

### Footnotes
[^a]: Proverbs 9:8 The ancient rabbis took this to have the force of a commandment: never give a rebuke that is sure to be ignored.

## On Life and Conduct
###### 1
A *good* name {earned by honorable behavior, godly wisdom, moral courage, and personal integrity} is more desirable than great riches;  
And favor is better than silver and gold.  
###### 2
The rich and poor have a common bond;  
The LORD is the Maker of them all.  
###### 3
A prudent *and* far-sighted *person* sees the evil {of sin} and hides himself {from it},  
But the naive continue on and are punished {by suffering the consequences of sin}.  
###### 4
The reward of humility {that is, having a realistic view of one's importance} and the {reverent, worshipful} fear of the LORD  
Is riches, honor, and life.  
###### 5
Thorns and snares are in the way of the obstinate {for their lack of honor and their wrong-doing traps them};  
He who guards himself {with godly wisdom} will be far from them *and* avoid the consequences they suffer.  
###### 6
Train up a child in the way he should go {teaching him to seek God's wisdom and will for his abilities and talents},  
Even when he is old he will not depart from it.  
###### 7
The rich rules over the poor,  
And the borrower is servant to the lender.  
###### 8
He who sows injustice will reap {a harvest of} trouble,  
And the rod of his wrath {with which he oppresses others} will fail.  
###### 9
He who is generous will be blessed,  
For he gives some of his food to the poor.  
###### 10
Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go away;  
Even strife and dishonor will cease.  
###### 11
He who loves purity of heart  
And whose speech is gracious will have the king as his friend.  
###### 12
The eyes of the LORD keep guard over knowledge *and* the one who has it,  
But He overthrows the words of the treacherous.  
###### 13
The lazy one {manufactures excuses and} says, "There is a lion outside!  
I will be killed in the streets {if I go out to work}!"  
###### 14
The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit {deep and inescapable};  
He who is cursed by the LORD {because of his adulterous sin} will fall into it.  
###### 15
Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;  
The rod of discipline {correction administered with godly wisdom and lovingkindness} will remove it far from him.  
###### 16
He who oppresses *or* exploits the poor to get more for himself  
Or who gives to the rich {to gain influence and favor}, will only come to poverty.
###### 17
Listen carefully and hear the [^a]words of the wise,  
And apply your mind to my knowledge;  
###### 18
For it will be pleasant if you keep them in mind {incorporating them as guiding principles};  
Let them be ready on your lips {to guide and strengthen yourself and others}.  
###### 19
So that your trust *and* reliance *and* confidence may be in the LORD,  
I have taught these things to you today, even to you.  
###### 20
Have I not written to you excellent things  
In counsels and knowledge,  
###### 21
To let you know the certainty of the words of truth,  
That you may give a correct answer to him who sent you?
###### 22
Do not rob the poor because he is poor {and defenseless},  
Nor crush the afflicted {by legal proceedings} at the gate {where the city court is held},  
###### 23
For the LORD will plead their case  
And take the life of those who rob them.
###### 24
Do not even associate with a man given to angry outbursts;  
Or go {along} with a hot-tempered man,  
###### 25
Or you will learn his {undisciplined} ways  
And get yourself trapped {in a situation from which it is hard to escape}.
###### 26
Do not be among those who give pledges {involving themselves in others' finances},  
Or among those who become guarantors for *others*' debts.  
###### 27
If you have nothing with which to pay {another's debt when he defaults},  
Why should his creditor take your bed from under you?
###### 28
Do not move the ancient landmark {at the boundary of the property}  
Which your fathers have set.
###### 29
Do you see a man skillful *and* experienced in his work?  
He will stand {in honor} before kings;  
He will not stand before obscure men.

## Pitfalls of Immorality
###### 1
My son, be attentive to my wisdom {godly wisdom learned by costly experience},  
Incline your ear to my understanding;  
###### 2
That you may exercise discrimination *and* discretion (good judgment),  
And your lips may reserve knowledge *and* answer wisely {to temptation}.  
###### 3
For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey {like a honeycomb}  
And her speech is smoother than oil;  
###### 4
But in the end she is bitter like {the extract of} wormwood,  
Sharp as a two-edged sword.  
###### 5
Her feet go down to death;  
Her steps take hold of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),  
###### 6
So that she does not think {seriously} about the path of life;  
Her ways are aimless *and* unstable; you cannot know where her path leads.
###### 7
Now then, my sons, listen to me  
And do not depart from (forget) the words of my mouth.  
###### 8
Let your way {in life} be far from her,  
And do not go near the door of her house {avoid even being near the places of temptation},  
###### 9
Or you will give your honor to others,  
And your years to the cruel one,  
###### 10
And strangers will be filled with your strength  
And your hard-earned wealth will go to the house of a foreigner {who does not know God};  
###### 11
And you will groan when your *life is* ending,  
When your flesh and your body are consumed;  
###### 12
And you say, "How I hated instruction *and* discipline,  
And my heart despised correction *and* reproof!  
###### 13
"I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,  
Nor have I inclined my ear to those who instructed me.  
###### 14
"I was almost in total ruin  
In the midst of the assembly and congregation."
###### 15
Drink[^a] water from your own [^b]cistern {of a pure marriage relationship}
And fresh running water from your own well.  
###### 16
Should your [^c]springs (children) be dispersed,  
As streams of water in the streets?  
###### 17
{Confine yourself to your own wife.} Let *your children* be yours alone,  
And not *the children* of strangers with you.  
###### 18
Let your fountain (wife) be blessed {with the rewards of fidelity},  
And rejoice in the wife of your youth.  
###### 19
*Let her be as* a loving hind and graceful doe,  
Let her breasts refresh *and* satisfy you at all times;  
Always be [^d]exhilarated *and* delight in her love.  
###### 20
Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an immoral woman  
And embrace the bosom of an outsider (pagan)?  
###### 21
For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the LORD,  
And He carefully watches all of his paths {all of his comings and goings}.  
###### 22
The iniquities done by a wicked man will trap him,  
And he will be held with the cords of his sin.  
###### 23
He will die for lack of instruction (discipline),  
And in the greatness of his foolishness he will go astray *and* be lost.

## Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
###### 1
A false balance *and* dishonest business practices are extremely offensive to the LORD,  
But an accurate scale is His delight.  
###### 2
When pride comes {boiling up with an arrogant attitude of self-importance}, then come dishonor *and* shame,  
But with the humble {the teachable who have been chiseled by trial and who have learned to walk humbly with God} there is wisdom *and* soundness of mind.  
###### 3
The integrity *and* moral courage of the upright will guide them,  
But the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them.  
###### 4
Riches will not provide security in the day of wrath *and* judgment,  
But righteousness rescues from death.  
###### 5
The righteousness of the blameless will smooth their way *and* keep it straight,  
But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.  
###### 6
The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,  
But the treacherous will be caught by their own greed.  
###### 7
When the wicked man dies, his expectation will perish;  
And the hope of {godless} strong men perishes.  
###### 8
The[^a] righteous is rescued from trouble,
And the wicked takes his place.  
###### 9
With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,  
But through knowledge *and* discernment the righteous will be rescued.  
###### 10
When it goes well for the righteous, the city rejoices,  
And when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.  
###### 11
By the blessing {of the influence} of the upright the city is exalted,  
But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.  
###### 12
He who despises his neighbor lacks sense,  
But a man of understanding keeps silent.  
###### 13
He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets,  
But he who is trustworthy *and* faithful keeps a matter hidden.  
###### 14
Where there is no {wise, intelligent} guidance, the people fall {and go off course like a ship without a helm},  
But in the abundance of {wise and godly} counselors there is victory.  
###### 15
He who puts up security *and* guarantees a debt for an outsider will surely suffer {for his foolishness},  
But he who hates (declines) being a guarantor is secure {from its penalties}.  
###### 16
A gracious *and* good woman attains honor,  
And ruthless men attain riches {but not respect}.  
###### 17
The merciful *and* generous man benefits his soul {for his behavior returns to bless him},  
But the cruel *and* callous man does himself harm.  
###### 18
The wicked man earns deceptive wages,  
But he who sows righteousness *and* lives his life with integrity will have a true reward {that is both permanent and satisfying}.  
###### 19
He who is steadfast in righteousness *attains* life,  
But he who pursues evil *attains* his own death.  
###### 20
The perverse in heart are repulsive *and* shamefully vile to the LORD,  
But those who are blameless *and* above reproach in their walk are His delight!  
###### 21
Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished,  
But the descendants of the righteous will be freed.  
###### 22
As a ring of gold in a swine's snout,  
So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion {her lack of character mocks her beauty}.  
###### 23
The desire of the righteous brings only good,  
But the expectation of the wicked brings wrath.  
###### 24
There is the one who {generously} scatters {abroad}, and yet increases all the more;  
And there is the one who withholds what is justly due, *but it results* only in want *and* poverty.  
###### 25
The generous man {is a source of blessing and} shall be prosperous *and* enriched,  
And he who waters will himself be watered {reaping the generosity he has sown}.  
###### 26
The people curse him who holds back grain {when the public needs it},  
But a blessing {from God and man} is upon the head of him who sells it.  
###### 27
He who diligently seeks good seeks favor *and* grace,  
But he who seeks evil, evil will come to him.  
###### 28
He who leans on *and* trusts in *and* is confident in his riches will fall,  
But the righteous {who trust in God's provision} will flourish like a *green* leaf.  
###### 29
He who troubles (mismanages) his own house will inherit the wind (nothing),  
And the foolish will be a servant to the wise-hearted.  
###### 30
The fruit of the {consistently} righteous is a tree of life,  
And he who is wise captures *and* wins souls {for God--he gathers them for eternity}.  
###### 31
If the righteous will be rewarded on the earth {with godly blessings},  
How much more {will} the wicked and the sinner {be repaid with punishment}!

### Footnotes
[^a]: Proverbs 11:8 The famous eleventh-century rabbi known as Rashi told a fable illustrating this verse. He said that a fox once told a wolf to come with him and he would give him abundant food. It was night, and the fox led the wolf to a well with a bucket at each end of the rope. The fox got into the bucket at the top of the well and rode down to the bottom. When the wolf asked him what he was doing, the fox pointed to the reflection of the moon in the water and said, “There is plenty of cheese and meat down here. Get in the other bucket and come down right away!” The wolf did, and as he went down the fox was pulled up in the first bucket. When the fox got to the top, the wolf said, “How am I supposed to get out?” Thereupon the fox quoted this verse to him.

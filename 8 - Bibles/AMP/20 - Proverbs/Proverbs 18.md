## Contrast the Upright and the Wicked
###### 1
He who {willfully} separates himself {from God and man} seeks his own desire,  
He quarrels against all sound wisdom.  
###### 2
A {closed-minded} fool does not delight in understanding,  
But only in revealing his personal opinions {unwittingly displaying his self-indulgence and his stupidity}.  
###### 3
When the wicked man comes {to the depth of evil}, contempt {of all that is pure and good} also comes,  
And with inner baseness (dishonor) comes outer shame (scorn).  
###### 4
The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters {copious and difficult to fathom};  
The fountain of {mature, godly} wisdom is like a bubbling stream {sparkling, fresh, pure, and life-giving}.  
###### 5
To show respect to the wicked person is not good,  
Nor to push aside *and* deprive the righteous of justice.  
###### 6
A fool's lips bring contention *and* strife,  
And his mouth invites a beating.  
###### 7
A fool's mouth is his ruin,  
And his lips are the snare of his soul.  
###### 8
The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels {to be greedily eaten};  
They go down into the innermost chambers of the body {to be remembered and mused upon}.  
###### 9
He who is careless in his work  
Is a brother to him who destroys.  
###### 10
The name of the LORD is a strong tower;  
The righteous runs to it and is safe *and* set on high {far above evil}.  
###### 11
The rich man's wealth is his strong city,  
And like a high wall {of protection} in his own imagination *and* conceit.  
###### 12
Before disaster the heart of a man is haughty *and* filled with self-importance,  
But humility comes before honor.  
###### 13
He who answers before he hears {the facts}--  
It is folly and shame to him.  
###### 14
The spirit of a man sustains him in sickness,  
But as for a broken spirit, who can bear it?  
###### 15
The mind of the prudent {always} acquires knowledge,  
And the ear of the wise {always} seeks knowledge.  
###### 16
A man's gift {given in love or courtesy} makes room for him  
And brings him before great men.  
###### 17
The first one to plead his case seems right,  
*Until* another comes and cross-examines him.  
###### 18
To[^a] cast lots puts an end to quarrels
And decides between powerful contenders.  
###### 19
A brother offended *is harder to win* over than a fortified city,  
And contentions {separating families} are like the bars of a castle.  
###### 20
A man's stomach will be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;  
He will be satisfied with the consequence of his words.  
###### 21
Death and life are in the power of the tongue,  
And those who love it *and* indulge it will eat its fruit *and* bear the consequences of their words.  
###### 22
He who finds a {[^b]true and faithful} wife finds a good thing  
And obtains favor *and* approval from the LORD.  
###### 23
The poor man pleads,  
But the rich man answers roughly.  
###### 24
The man of *too many* friends {chosen indiscriminately} will be broken in pieces *and* come to ruin,  
But there is a {true, loving} friend who {is reliable and} sticks closer than a brother.

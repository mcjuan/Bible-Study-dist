## Warnings and Instructions
###### 1
He who hardens his neck *and* refuses instruction after being often reproved (corrected, criticized),  
Will suddenly be broken beyond repair.  
###### 2
When the righteous are in authority *and* become great, the people rejoice;  
But when the wicked man rules, the people groan *and* sigh.  
###### 3
A man who loves {skillful and godly} wisdom makes his father joyful,  
But he who associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth.  
###### 4
The king establishes (stabilizes) the land by justice,  
But a man who takes bribes overthrows it.  
###### 5
A man who flatters his neighbor {with smooth words intending to do harm}  
Is spreading a net for his own feet.  
###### 6
By his wicked plan an evil man is trapped,  
But the righteous man sings and rejoices {for his plan brings good things to him}.  
###### 7
The righteous man cares for the rights of the poor,  
But the wicked man has no interest in such knowledge.  
###### 8
Scoffers set a city afire {by stirring up trouble},  
But wise men turn away anger {and restore order with their good judgment}.  
###### 9
If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish *and* arrogant man,  
The foolish man {ignores logic and fairness and} only rages or laughs, and there is no peace (rest, agreement).  
###### 10
The bloodthirsty hate the blameless {because of his integrity},  
But the upright are concerned for his life.  
###### 11
A {shortsighted} fool always loses his temper *and* displays his anger,  
But a wise man {uses self-control and} holds it back.  
###### 12
If a ruler pays attention to lies {and encourages corruption},  
All his officials *will become* wicked.  
###### 13
The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:  
The LORD gives light to the eyes of both.  
###### 14
If a king faithfully *and* truthfully judges the poor,  
His throne shall be established forever.  
###### 15
The rod and reproof (godly instruction) give wisdom,  
But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.  
###### 16
When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases,  
But the righteous will see the downfall of the wicked.  
###### 17
Correct your son, and he will give you comfort;  
Yes, he will delight your soul.  
###### 18
Where there is no vision {no revelation of God and His word}, the people are unrestrained;  
But happy *and* blessed is he who keeps the law {of God}.  
###### 19
A servant will not be corrected by words *alone*;  
For though he understands, he will not respond {nor pay attention}.  
###### 20
Do you see a {conceited} man who speaks quickly {offering his opinions or answering without thinking}?  
There is more hope for a {thickheaded} [^a]fool than for him.  
###### 21
He who pampers his slave from childhood  
Will find him to be a son in the end.  
###### 22
An angry man stirs up strife,  
And a hot-tempered *and* undisciplined man commits many transgressions.  
###### 23
A man's pride *and* sense of self-importance will bring him down,  
But he who has a humble spirit will obtain honor.  
###### 24
Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own life;  
He hears the curse {when swearing an oath to testify}, but discloses nothing {and commits perjury by omission}.  
###### 25
The fear of man brings a snare,  
But whoever trusts in *and* puts his confidence in the LORD will be exalted *and* safe.  
###### 26
Many seek the ruler's favor,  
But justice for man comes from the LORD.  
###### 27
An unjust man is repulsive to the righteous,  
And he who is upright in the way {of the LORD} is repulsive to the wicked.

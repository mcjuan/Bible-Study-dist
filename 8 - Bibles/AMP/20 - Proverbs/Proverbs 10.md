## Contrast of the Righteous and the Wicked
###### 1
The proverbs of Solomon:
A wise son makes a father glad,  
But a foolish {stubborn} son {who refuses to learn} is a grief to his mother.  
###### 2
Treasures of wickedness *and* ill-gotten gains do not profit,  
But righteousness *and* moral integrity in daily life rescues from death.  
###### 3
The LORD will not allow the [^a]righteous to hunger {God will meet all his needs},  
But He will reject *and* cast away the craving of the wicked.  
###### 4
Poor is he who works with a negligent *and* idle hand,  
But the hand of the diligent makes *him* rich.  
###### 5
He who gathers during summer *and* takes advantage of his opportunities is a son who acts wisely,  
*But* he who sleeps during harvest *and* ignores the moment of opportunity is a son who acts shamefully.  
###### 6
Blessings are on the head of the righteous {the upright, those in right standing with God},  
But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.  
###### 7
The [^b]memory of the righteous {person} is a {source of} blessing,  
But the name of the wicked will {be forgotten and} rot {like a corpse}.  
###### 8
The wise in heart {are willing to learn so they} will accept *and* obey commands (instruction),  
But the babbling fool {who is arrogant and thinks himself wise} will come to ruin.  
###### 9
He who walks in integrity *and* with moral character walks securely,  
But he who takes a crooked way will be discovered *and* punished.  
###### 10
He who {maliciously} winks the eye {of evil intent} causes trouble;  
And the babbling fool {who is arrogant and thinks himself wise} will come to ruin.  
###### 11
The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life *and* his words of wisdom are a source of blessing,  
But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence *and* evil.  
###### 12
Hatred stirs up strife,  
But love covers *and* overwhelms all transgressions {forgiving and overlooking another's faults}.  
###### 13
On the lips of the discerning, {skillful and godly} wisdom is found,  
But discipline *and* the rod are for the back of the one who is without common sense *and* understanding.  
###### 14
Wise men store up *and* treasure knowledge {in mind and heart},  
But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand.  
###### 15
The rich man's wealth is his fortress;  
The ruin of the poor is their poverty.  
###### 16
The wages of the righteous {the upright, those in right standing with God} is {a worthwhile, meaningful} life,  
The income of the wicked, punishment.  
###### 17
He who learns from instruction *and* correction is on the {right} path of life {and for others his example is a path toward wisdom and blessing},  
But he who ignores *and* refuses correction goes off course {and for others his example is a path toward sin and ruin}.  
###### 18
He who hides hatred has lying lips,  
And he who spreads slander is a fool.  
###### 19
When there are many words, transgression *and* offense are unavoidable,  
But he who controls his lips *and* keeps thoughtful silence is wise.  
###### 20
The tongue of the righteous is like precious silver (greatly valued);  
The heart of the wicked is worth little.  
###### 21
The lips of the righteous feed *and* guide many,  
But fools {who reject God and His wisdom} die for lack of understanding.  
###### 22
The blessing of the LORD brings {true} riches,  
And He adds no sorrow to it {for it comes as a blessing from God}.  
###### 23
Engaging in evil is like sport to the fool {who refuses wisdom and chases sin},  
But to a man of understanding {skillful and godly} wisdom *brings joy*.  
###### 24
What the wicked fears will come upon him,  
But the desire of the righteous {for the blessings of God} will be granted.  
###### 25
When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more,  
But the righteous has an everlasting foundation.  
###### 26
Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,  
So is the lazy one to those who send him *to work*.  
###### 27
The {reverent} fear of the LORD {worshiping, obeying, serving, and trusting Him with awe-filled respect} prolongs one's life,  
But the years of the wicked will be shortened.  
###### 28
The hope of the righteous {those of honorable character and integrity} is joy,  
But the expectation of the wicked {those who oppose God and ignore His wisdom} comes to nothing.  
###### 29
The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright,  
But it is ruin to those who do evil.  
###### 30
The {consistently} righteous will never be shaken,  
But the wicked will not inhabit the earth.  
###### 31
The mouth of the righteous flows with {skillful and godly} wisdom,  
But the perverted tongue will be cut out.  
###### 32
The lips of the righteous know (speak) what is acceptable,  
But the mouth of the wicked knows (speaks) what is perverted (twisted).

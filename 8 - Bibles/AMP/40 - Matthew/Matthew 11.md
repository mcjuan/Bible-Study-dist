## John's Questions
###### 1
When Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and to preach in their {Galilean} cities.
###### 2
Now when [^a]John {the Baptist} in prison heard about the activities of Christ, he sent *word* by his disciples  
###### 3
and asked Him, "Are You the Expected One (the Messiah), or should we look for someone else {who will be the promised One}?"  
###### 4
Jesus answered, "Go and report to John what you hear and see:  
###### 5
the blind receive {their} sight and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed {by healing} and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.  
###### 6
And blessed {joyful, favored by God} is he who does not take offense at Me {accepting Me as the Messiah and trusting confidently in My message of salvation}."

## Jesus' Tribute to John
###### 7
As these men were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out in the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind {which is commonplace}?  
###### 8
What did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft *clothing* {entirely unsuited for the harsh desert}? Those who wear soft *clothing* are in the palaces of kings!  
###### 9
But what did you {really} go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and one {more eminent, more remarkable, and} [^b]far more than a prophet {who foretells the future}.  
###### 10
This is the one of whom it is written {by the prophet Malachi},
'Behold, I send My messenger ahead of You,  
Who will prepare Your way before You.'
###### 11
I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, among those born of women there has not risen *anyone* greater than John the Baptist; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater {in privilege} than he.  
###### 12
From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violent assault, and violent men seize it by force {as a precious prize}.  
###### 13
For all the prophets and the Law prophesied up until John.  
###### 14
And if you are willing to accept it, John himself is {the fulfillment of} Elijah {as the messenger} who was to come {before the kingdom}.  
###### 15
He who has ears to hear, let him hear *and* heed My words.
###### 16
"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market places, who call to the others,  
###### 17
and say 'We piped the flute for you {playing wedding}, and you did not dance; we wailed sad dirges {playing funeral}, and you did not mourn *and* cry aloud.'  
###### 18
For John came neither eating nor drinking {with others}, and they say, 'He has a demon!'  
###### 19
The Son of Man came eating and drinking {with others}, and they say, 'Look! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners {including non-observant Jews}!' Yet wisdom is justified *and* vindicated by her deeds {in the lives of those who respond to Me}."

## The Unrepenting Cities
###### 20
Then He began to denounce {the people in} the cities in which most of His miracles were done, because they did not repent {and change their hearts and lives}.  
###### 21
"Woe (judgment is coming) to you, [^c]Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon {cities of the Gentiles}, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes {their hearts would have been changed and they would have expressed sorrow for their sin and rebellion against God}.  
###### 22
Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for {the pagan cities of} Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.  
###### 23
And you, Capernaum, are you to be exalted to heaven {for your apathy and unresponsiveness}? You will descend to Hades (the realm of the dead); for if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.  
###### 24
But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment, than for you."

## Come to Me
###### 25
At that time Jesus said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth {I openly and joyfully acknowledge Your great wisdom}, that You have hidden these things {these spiritual truths} from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to infants {to new believers, to those seeking God's will and purpose}.  
###### 26
Yes, Father, for this way was well-pleasing in Your sight.  
###### 27
All things have been handed over to Me by My Father; and no one fully knows *and* accurately understands the Son except the Father; and no one fully knows *and* accurately understands the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son {deliberately} wills to reveal *Him*.
###### 28
"Come to Me, all who are weary and heavily burdened {by religious rituals that provide no peace}, and I will give you rest {refreshing your souls with salvation}.  
###### 29
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me {following Me as My disciple}, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest (renewal, blessed quiet) for your souls.  
###### 30
For My yoke is easy {to bear} and My burden is light."

## Rank in the Kingdom
###### 1
At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"  
###### 2
He called a little child and set him before them,  
###### 3
and said, "I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, unless you repent {that is, change your inner self--your old way of thinking, live changed lives} and become like children {trusting, humble, and forgiving}, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  
###### 4
Therefore, whoever [^a]humbles himself like this child is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  
###### 5
Whoever receives *and* welcomes one [^b]child like this in My name receives Me;  
###### 6
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble *and* sin {by leading him away from My teaching}, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone {as large as one turned by a donkey} hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.

## Stumbling Blocks
###### 7
"Woe (judgment is coming) to the world because of stumbling blocks *and* temptations to sin! It is inevitable that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person on whose account *or* through whom the stumbling block comes!
###### 8
"If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble *and* sin, cut it off and throw it away from you {that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation}; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into everlasting fire.  
###### 9
If your eye causes you to stumble *and* sin, pluck it out and throw it away from you {that is, remove yourself from the source of temptation}; it is better for you to enter life with only one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.
###### 10
"See that you do not despise *or* think less of one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven {are in the presence of and} continually look upon the face of My Father who is in heaven.  
###### 11
{For[^c] the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.}Ninety-nine Plus One
###### 12
"What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountain and go in search of the one that is lost?  
###### 13
And if it turns out that he finds it, I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not get lost.  
###### 14
So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones be lost.

## Discipline and Prayer
###### 15
"If your brother sins[^d], go and show him his fault in private; if he listens *and* pays attention to you, you have won back your brother.  
###### 16
But if he does not listen, take along with you one or two others, so that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.  
###### 17
If he pays no attention to them {refusing to listen and obey}, tell it to the [^e]church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile (unbeliever) and a tax collector.  
###### 18
I assure you *and* most solemnly say to you, whatever you bind {forbid, declare to be improper and unlawful} on earth [^f]shall have {already} been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose {permit, declare lawful} on earth [^g]shall have {already} been loosed in heaven.
###### 19
"Again I say to you, that if two [^h]believers on earth agree {that is, are of one mind, in harmony} about anything that they ask {within the will of God}, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.  
###### 20
For where two or three are gathered in My name {meeting together as My followers}, I am there among them."

## Forgiveness
###### 21
Then Peter came to Him and asked, "Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I forgive him *and* let it go? Up to seven times?"  
###### 22
Jesus answered him, "I say to you, not up to seven times, but seventy times seven.
###### 23
"Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wished to settle accounts with his slaves.  
###### 24
When he began the accounting, one who owed him 10,000 [^i]talents was brought to him.  
###### 25
But because he could not repay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and his children and everything that he possessed, and payment to be made.  
###### 26
So the slave fell on his knees and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you everything.'  
###### 27
And his master's heart was moved with compassion and he released him and forgave him {canceling} the debt.  
###### 28
But that same slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him [^j]a hundred denarii; and he seized him and *began* choking him, saying, 'Pay what you owe!'  
###### 29
So his fellow slave fell on his knees and begged him earnestly, 'Have patience with me and I will repay you.'  
###### 30
But he was unwilling and he went and had him thrown in prison until he paid back the debt.  
###### 31
When his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were deeply grieved and they went and reported to their master {with clarity and in detail} everything that had taken place.  
###### 32
Then his master called him and said to him, 'You wicked *and* contemptible slave, I forgave all that {great} debt of yours because you begged me.  
###### 33
Should you not have had mercy on your fellow slave {who owed you little by comparison}, as I had mercy on you?'  
###### 34
And in wrath his master turned him over to the torturers (jailers) until he paid all that he owed.  
###### 35
My heavenly Father will also do the same to {every one of} you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart."

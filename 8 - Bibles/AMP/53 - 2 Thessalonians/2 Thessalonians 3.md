## Exhortation
###### 1
Finally, brothers and sisters, pray *continually* for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be honored {triumphantly celebrated and glorified}, just as it was with you;  
###### 2
and {pray} that we will be rescued from perverse and evil men; for not everyone has the faith.  
###### 3
But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you {setting you on a firm foundation} and will protect *and* guard you from the evil *one*.  
###### 4
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will *continue* to do the things {which} we command.  
###### 5
May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness *and* patience of Christ.
###### 6
Now we command you, believers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ *and* by His authority, that you withdraw *and* keep away from every brother or sister who leads an undisciplined life and does not live in accordance with the tradition *and* teaching that [^a]you have received from us.  
###### 7
For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined *or* inappropriate manner when we were with you {we were never idle or lazy, nor did we avoid our duties},  
###### 8
nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day {to pay our own way} so that we would not be a *financial* burden on any of you {for our support};  
###### 9
not because we do not have a right *to such support*, but {we provided our own financial support} to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example.  
###### 10
For even while we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is [^b]not to eat, either.  
###### 11
Indeed, we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined *and* inappropriate life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies {meddling in other people's business}.  
###### 12
Now such people we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down *and* work quietly and earn their own food *and* other necessities {supporting themselves instead of depending on the hospitality of others}.  
###### 13
And as for {the rest of} you, [^c]believers, do not grow tired *or* lose heart in doing good {but continue doing what is right without weakening}.
###### 14
Now if anyone {in the church} does not obey what we say in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he will be ashamed *and* repent.  
###### 15
Do not regard him as an enemy, but keep admonishing him as a {believing} brother.
###### 16
Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace at all times *and* in every way {that peace and spiritual well-being that comes to those who walk with Him, regardless of life's circumstances}. The Lord be with you all.
###### 17
I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the distinguishing mark in every letter {of mine, that shows it is genuine}. It is the way I write {my handwriting and signature}.  
###### 18
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 2 Thessalonians 3:6 One early ms reads *they*.
[^b]: 2 Thessalonians 3:10 I.e. if one is able, but unwilling to work to provide for himself or his family, it is unjust for him to receive the necessities of life provided free by those who willingly work.
[^c]: 2 Thessalonians 3:13 Lit *brethren*.

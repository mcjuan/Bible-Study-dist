## Man of Lawlessness
###### 1
Now in regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our [^a]gathering together to *meet* Him, we ask you, [^b]brothers and sisters,  
###### 2
not to be quickly unsettled or alarmed either by a {so-called prophetic revelation of a} spirit or a message or a letter {alleged to be} from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has {already} come.  
###### 3
Let no one in any way deceive *or* entrap you, for *that day will not come* unless the [^c]apostasy comes first {that is, the great rebellion, the abandonment of the faith by professed Christians}, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction {the Antichrist, the one who is destined to be destroyed},  
###### 4
who opposes and exalts himself {so proudly and so insolently} above [^d]every so-called god or object of worship, so that he {actually enters and} takes his seat in the temple of God, publicly proclaiming that he himself is God.  
###### 5
Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I was telling you these things?  
###### 6
And you know what restrains him now {from being revealed}; it is so that he will be revealed at his own {appointed} time.  
###### 7
For the mystery of lawlessness {rebellion against divine authority and the coming reign of lawlessness} is already at work; {but it is restrained} only until he who now restrains it is taken out of the way.  
###### 8
Then the lawless one {the Antichrist} will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by the appearance of His coming.  
###### 9
The coming of the {Antichrist, the lawless} one is through the activity of Satan, {attended} with great power {all kinds of counterfeit miracles} and {deceptive} signs and false wonders {all of them lies},  
###### 10
and by unlimited seduction to evil *and* with all the deception of wickedness for those who are perishing, because they did not welcome the love of the truth {of the gospel} so as to be saved {they were spiritually blind, and rejected the truth that would have saved them}.  
###### 11
Because of this God will send upon them a misleading influence, {an activity of error and deception} so they will believe the lie,  
###### 12
in order that all may be judged *and* condemned who did not believe the truth {about their sin, and the need for salvation through Christ}, but *instead* took pleasure in unrighteousness.
###### 13
But we should *and* are {morally} obligated {as debtors} always to give thanks to God for you, believers beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through the [^e]sanctifying work of the Spirit {that sets you apart for God's purpose} and by your faith in the truth {of God's word that leads you to spiritual maturity}.  
###### 14
It was to this end that He called you through our gospel {the good news of Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection}, so that you may obtain *and* share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
###### 15
So then, [^f]brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold {tightly} to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word *of mouth* or by letter from us.
###### 16
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us everlasting comfort *and* encouragement and the good {well-founded} hope {of salvation} by *His* grace,  
###### 17
comfort *and* encourage and strengthen your hearts {keeping them steadfast and on course} in every good work and word.

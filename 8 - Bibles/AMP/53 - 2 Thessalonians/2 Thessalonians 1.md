## Thanksgiving for Faith and Perseverance
###### 1
Paul, Silvanus (Silas), and Timothy,
To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  
###### 2
Grace to you and peace {inner calm and spiritual well-being} from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### 3
We ought always *and* indeed are morally obligated {as those in debt} to give thanks to God for you, [^a]brothers and sisters, as is fitting, because your faith is growing ever greater, and the {unselfish} [^b]love of each one of you toward one another is continually increasing.  
###### 4
Therefore, we speak of you with pride among the churches of God for your steadfastness {your unflinching endurance, and patience} and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecution and {crushing} distress which you endure.  
###### 5
*This is* a positive proof of the righteous judgment of God {a sign of His fair verdict}, so that you will be considered worthy of His kingdom, for which indeed you are suffering.  
###### 6
For after all it is *only* just for God to repay with distress those who distress you,  
###### 7
and to *give* relief to you who are so distressed and to us as well when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire,  
###### 8
dealing out {full and complete} vengeance to those who do not {seek to} know God and to those who ignore *and* refuse to obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus {by choosing not to respond to Him}.  
###### 9
These people will pay the penalty *and* endure the punishment of [^c]everlasting destruction, banished from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,  
###### 10
when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day {that is, glorified through the changed lives of those who have accepted Him as Savior and have been set apart for His purpose}, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed *and* trusted {and confirmed in your lives}.  
###### 11
With this in view, we constantly pray for you, that our God will count you worthy of your calling {to faith} and with {His} power fulfill every desire for goodness, and complete {your} every work of faith,  
###### 12
so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you {by what you do}, and you in Him, according to the {precious} grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 2 Thessalonians 1:3 Lit *brethren*, includes all born-again believers.
[^b]: 2 Thessalonians 1:3 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word *agape*) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for another.
[^c]: 2 Thessalonians 1:9 Not annihilation, but the loss of all meaningful things.

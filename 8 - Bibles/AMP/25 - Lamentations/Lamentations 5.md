## A Prayer for Mercy
###### 1
O LORD, remember what has come upon us;  
Look, and see our reproach (national disgrace)!  
###### 2
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,  
Our houses to foreigners.  
###### 3
We have become orphans without a father;  
Our mothers are like widows.  
###### 4
We have to pay for our drinking water;  
Our wood comes to us at a price.  
###### 5
Our pursuers are at our necks;  
We are worn out, there is no rest for us.  
###### 6
We have given the hand {as a pledge of fidelity and submission} to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.  
###### 7
Our fathers sinned, and are no more;  
It is [^a]we who have carried their sin.  
###### 8
Servants rule over us;  
There is no one to rescue us out of their hand.  
###### 9
We get our bread at the risk of our lives  
Because of the sword {of the Arabs} in the wilderness {who may attack if we go out to harvest the crop}.  
###### 10
Our skin is as hot as {the heat of} an oven  
Because of the burning heat of {the fever of} famine.  
###### 11
They ravished the women in Zion,  
The virgins in the cities of Judah.  
###### 12
Princes were hung by their hands;  
Elders were not respected.  
###### 13
Young men worked at the grinding mill,  
And boys fell {staggering} under loads of wood.  
###### 14
Elders are gone from the gate;  
Young men from their music.  
###### 15
The joy of our hearts has ended;  
Our dancing has been turned into mourning.  
###### 16
The crown has fallen from our head {our honor is covered with dust}!  
Woe to us, for we have sinned!  
###### 17
Because of this our heart is faint,  
Because of these things our eyes are dim.  
###### 18
As for Mount Zion, which lies desolate,  
Foxes *and* the jackals prowl over it.
###### 19
But You, O LORD, reign forever;  
Your throne endures from generation to {all} generations.  
###### 20
Why do You forget us forever?  
Why do You forsake us so long?  
###### 21
Return us to You, O LORD, so that we may be restored;  
Renew our days as of old,  
###### 22
Unless You have utterly rejected us  
And are exceedingly angry with us.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Lamentations 5:7 Both forefathers and sons were responsible for the disaster that had come on Jerusalem. This generation was equally deserving of punishment.

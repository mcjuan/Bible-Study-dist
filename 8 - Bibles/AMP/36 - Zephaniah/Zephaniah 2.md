## Judgments on Judah's Enemies
###### 1
Gather yourselves together {in repentance}, yes, gather {in submission},  
O nation without shame,  
###### 2
Before the decree takes effect {and the time for repentance is lost}--  
The day passes like the chaff {whirled by the wind}--  
Before the burning *and* fierce anger of the LORD comes upon you,  
Before the day of the wrath of the LORD comes upon you.  
###### 3
Seek the LORD {search diligently for Him and regard Him as the foremost necessity of your life},  
All you humble of the land  
Who have practiced His ordinances *and* have kept His commandments;  
Seek righteousness, seek humility {regard them as vital}.  
Perhaps you will be hidden {and pardoned and rescued}  
In the day of the Lord's anger.
###### 4
For {this is the fate of the Philistines:} Gaza will be abandoned  
And Ashkelon a desolation;  
{The people of} Ashdod will be driven out at noon {in broad daylight}  
And Ekron will be uprooted *and* destroyed.  
###### 5
Woe (judgment is coming) to the inhabitants of the seacoast,  
The nation of the Cherethites {in Philistia}!  
The word of the LORD is against you,  
O Canaan, land of the Philistines;  
I will destroy you  
So that no inhabitant will be left.  
###### 6
So the {depopulated} seacoast shall be pastures,  
With {deserted} meadows for shepherds and folds for flocks.  
###### 7
The [^a]seacoast will belong  
To the remnant of the house of Judah;  
They will pasture {their flocks} on it.  
In the {deserted} houses of Ashkelon {in Philistia} they {of Judah} will lie down *and* rest in the evening,  
For the LORD their God will care for them;  
And restore their fortune {permitting them to occupy the land}.
###### 8
"I have heard the taunting of Moab  
And the revilings of the sons of Ammon,  
With which they have taunted My people  
And become arrogant against their territory {by violating Israel's boundary and trying to seize its land}.  
###### 9
"Therefore, as I live," declares the LORD of hosts,  
The God of Israel,  
"[^b]Moab will in fact become like Sodom  
And the [^c]sons of Ammon like Gomorrah,  
A land possessed by nettles and salt pits,  
And a perpetual desolation.  
The remnant of My people will plunder them  
And what is left of My nation will inherit them {as their own}."
###### 10
This they shall have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts.  
###### 11
The LORD will be terrifying *and* awesome to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down *and* worship Him, everyone from his own place.
###### 12
"You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword."  
###### 13
And the LORD will stretch out His hand against the north  
And destroy Assyria,  
And He will make Nineveh a desolation {a wasteland},  
Parched as the desert.  
###### 14
Flocks will lie down in her midst,  
All the animals which range in herds;  
Both the pelican and the short-eared owl  
Will roost on the top of Nineveh's pillars.  
Birds will sing in the window,  
Desolation will be on the threshold;  
For He has uncovered the cedar paneling.  
###### 15
This is the joyous city  
Which dwells carelessly {feeling so secure},  
Who says in her heart,  
"I am, and there is no one besides me."  
What a desolation she has become,  
A lair for {wild} animals!  
Everyone who passes by her will hiss {in scorn}  
And wave his hand *in contempt*.

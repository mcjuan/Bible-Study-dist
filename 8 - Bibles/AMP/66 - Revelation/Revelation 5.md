## The Scroll with Seven Seals
###### 1
I saw in the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the back, closed *and* sealed with seven seals.  
###### 2
And I saw a strong angel announcing with a loud voice, "Who is worthy {having the authority and virtue} to open the scroll and to [^a]break its seals?"  
###### 3
And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth {in Hades, the realm of the dead} was able to open the scroll or look into it.  
###### 4
And I *began* to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it.  
###### 5
Then one of the {twenty-four} elders said to me, "Stop weeping! Look closely, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome *and* conquered! He can open the scroll and {break} its seven seals."
###### 6
And there [^b]between the throne (with the four living creatures) and among the elders I saw a Lamb (Christ) standing, {bearing scars and wounds} as though it had been slain, with seven horns (complete power) and with seven eyes (complete knowledge), which are [^c]the seven Spirits of God who have been sent {on duty} into all the earth.  
###### 7
And He came and [^d]took the scroll from the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.  
###### 8
And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb (Christ), each one holding a harp and golden bowls full of fragrant incense, which are the prayers of the saints (God's people).  
###### 9
And they sang a new song {of glorious redemption}, saying,
"Worthy *and* deserving are You to take the scroll and to break its seals; for You were slain (sacrificed), and with Your blood You purchased *people* for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.  
###### 10
"You have made them to be a kingdom {of royal subjects} and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."

## Angels Exalt the Lamb
###### 11
Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and {the voice} of the living creatures and the elders; and they numbered myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands (innumerable),  
###### 12
saying in a loud voice,
"Worthy *and* deserving is the Lamb that was sacrificed to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing."
###### 13
And I heard every created thing that is in heaven or on earth or under the earth {in Hades, the realm of the dead} or on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying {together},
"To Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb (Christ), be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever."
###### 14
And the four living creatures kept saying, "Amen." And the elders fell down and worshiped {Him who lives forever and ever}.

### Footnotes

[^b]: Revelation 5:6 The Lamb is Jesus Christ, who stands “between,” in other words both as one with God upon the throne and as one with humanity around the throne.
[^c]: Revelation 5:6 See note 1:4.
[^d]: Revelation 5:7 Lit *has taken*. This is the Greek perfect tense, which John sometimes uses to emphasize the lasting significance of an action or event.

## Scene in Heaven
###### 1
After this I looked, and behold, [^a]a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice which I had heard, like *the sound* of a {war} trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things."  
###### 2
At once I was in {special communication with} the Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne.  
###### 3
And He who sat there appeared like {the crystalline sparkle of} [^b]a jasper stone and {the fiery redness of} a sardius stone, and encircling the throne *there was* a rainbow that looked like {the color of an} emerald.  
###### 4
Twenty-four {other} thrones surrounded the throne; and seated on these thrones were [^c]twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, with crowns of gold on their heads.

## The Throne and Worship of the Creator
###### 5
From the throne came flashes of lightning and {rumbling} sounds and peals of thunder. Seven lamps of fire were burning in front of the throne, which are [^d]the seven Spirits of God;  
###### 6
and in front of the throne *there was something* like a sea *or* large expanse of glass, like {the clearest} crystal. In the center and around the throne were four living [^e]creatures who were full of eyes in front and behind {seeing everything and knowing everything that is around them}.  
###### 7
The[^f] first living creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf (ox), the third creature had the face of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.
###### 8
And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes all over and within {underneath their wings}; and day and night they never stop saying,
"Holy, holy, holy {is the} Lord God, the Almighty {the Omnipotent, the Ruler of all}, who was and who is and who is to come {the unchanging, eternal God}."
###### 9
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,  
###### 10
the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne, saying,
###### 11
"Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they exist, and were created *and* brought into being."

### Footnotes
[^a]: Revelation 4:1 This chapter begins the revelation to John of future events.
[^b]: Revelation 4:3 In antiquity this name was given to various kinds and colors of precious stones, while the *sardius* was a reddish stone. The gems are indicative of royalty.
[^c]: Revelation 4:4 The twenty-four elders may indicate the twelve tribes of Israel together with the twelve apostles, representing redeemed humanity. Others say the twenty-four may be an angelic order of worship akin to the Aaronic priests.
[^d]: Revelation 4:5 See note 1:4.
[^e]: Revelation 4:6 Some scholars identify these creatures as cherubim glorifying God and guarding the throne of heaven; others suggest the creatures represent God’s attributes (especially His omniscience and omnipresence).
[^f]: Revelation 4:7 Jewish tradition suggests that during the exodus the four standards of the tribal triads depicted these images: the triad led by Judah, the lion; the triad led by Reuben, the man; the triad led by Ephraim, the ox; the triad led by Dan, the eagle.

## Zion's Joyful Future
###### 1
The wilderness and the dry land will be glad;  
The Arabah (desert) will shout in exultation and blossom  
Like the [^a]autumn crocus.  
###### 2
It will blossom abundantly  
And rejoice with joy and singing.  
The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,  
The majesty of {Mount} Carmel and {the plain} of Sharon.  
They will see the glory of the LORD,  
The majesty *and* splendor of our God.  
###### 3
Encourage the exhausted, and make staggering knees firm.  
###### 4
Say to those with an anxious *and* panic-stricken heart,  
"Be strong, fear not!  
Indeed, your God will come with vengeance {for the ungodly};  
The retribution of God will come,  
But He will save you."  
###### 5
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened  
And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.  
###### 6
Then the lame will leap like a deer,  
And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy.  
For waters will break forth in the wilderness  
And streams in the desert.  
###### 7
And the burning sand (mirage) will become a pool {of water}  
And the thirsty ground springs of water;  
In the haunt of jackals, [^b]where they lay resting,  
Grass becomes reeds and [^c]rushes.  
###### 8
A highway will be there, and a roadway;  
And it will be called the Holy Way.  
The unclean will not travel on it,  
But it will be for those who walk on the way {the redeemed};  
And fools will not wander *on it*.  
###### 9
No lion will be there,  
Nor will any predatory animal come up on it;  
They will not be found there.  
But the redeemed will walk *there*.  
###### 10
And the ransomed of the LORD will return  
And come to Zion with shouts of jubilation,  
And everlasting joy will be upon their heads;  
They will find joy and gladness,  
And sorrow and sighing will flee away.

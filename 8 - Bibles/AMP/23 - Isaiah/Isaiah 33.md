## The Judgment of God
###### 1
Woe (judgment is coming) to you, O destroyer,  
You who were not destroyed,  
And he who is treacherous, while *others* did not deal treacherously with him.  
As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;  
As soon as you stop dealing treacherously, *others* will deal treacherously with you.  
###### 2
O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited {expectantly} for You.  
Be the arm of Your servants every morning {that is, their strength and their defense},  
Our salvation also in the time of trouble.  
###### 3
At the sound of the tumult, the peoples flee;  
At the lifting up of Yourself nations scatter.  
###### 4
Your spoil {of Israel's foe} is gathered {by the people of Jerusalem} as the caterpillar gathers;  
As locusts swarming so people swarm on it.  
###### 5
The LORD is exalted, for He dwells on high;  
He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.  
###### 6
And He will be the security *and* stability of your times,  
A treasure of salvation, wisdom and knowledge;  
The fear of the LORD is your treasure.  
###### 7
Now look, their brave men shout outside;  
The ambassadors {seeking a treaty} of peace weep bitterly.  
###### 8
The highways are deserted, the traveler has ceased {to appear}.  
*The enemy* has broken the covenant, he has rejected the [^a]cities,  
He has no regard for {any} man.  
###### 9
The land mourns and dries out,  
Lebanon is shamed and {its lush foliage} withers;  
Sharon[^b] is like a desert plain,
And [^c]Bashan and {Mount} Carmel shake off *their leaves*.  
###### 10
"Now I will arise," says the LORD.  
"Now I will be exalted; now I will be lifted up.  
###### 11
"You have conceived dried grass, you will give birth to stubble;  
My breath is a fire that will consume you.  
###### 12
"The peoples will be burned to lime,  
Like thorns cut down which are burned in the fire.
###### 13
"You who are far away, hear what I have done;  
And you who are near, acknowledge My might."  
###### 14
The sinners in Zion are terrified;  
Trembling has seized the godless.  
{They cry} "Who among us can live with the consuming fire?  
Who among us can live with everlasting burning?"  
###### 15
He who walks righteously and speaks with integrity,  
Who rejects gain from fraud *and* from oppression,  
Who shakes his hand free from the taking of bribes,  
Who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed  
And shuts his eyes to avoid looking upon evil;  
###### 16
He will dwell on the heights,  
His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks,  
His bread will be given him;  
His water will be permanent.
###### 17
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty;  
They will see a far-distant land.  
###### 18
Your mind will meditate on the terror {asking}:  
"Where is he who counts?  
Where is he who weighs {the tribute}?  
Where is he who counts the towers?"  
###### 19
You will no longer see the fierce *and* insolent people,  
A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends,  
Of a strange *and* stammering tongue which no one understands.  
###### 20
Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts *and* observances;  
Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a undisturbed settlement,  
A tent which will not be taken down;  
Not one of its stakes will ever be pulled up,  
Nor any of its ropes be severed.  
###### 21
But there the mighty *and* magnificent LORD will be for us  
A place of broad rivers and streams,  
Where no oar-driven boat will go,  
And on which no mighty *and* stately ship will pass.  
###### 22
For the LORD is our Judge,  
The LORD is our Ruler,  
The LORD is our King;  
He will save us.  
###### 23
Your ship's ropes (tackle) hang loose;  
They cannot hold the base of their mast firmly,  
Nor spread out the sail.  
Then an abundance of spoil and plunder will be divided;  
Even the lame will take the plunder.  
###### 24
And no inhabitant {of Zion} will say, "I am sick";  
The people who dwell there will be forgiven their wickedness {their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing}.

## The Deliverance of Israel
###### 1
In that day the Lord will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent  
With His fierce and great and mighty sword {rescuing Israel from her enemy},  
Even Leviathan the twisted serpent;  
And He will kill the dragon who *lives* in the sea.
###### 2
In that day {it will be said of the redeemed nation of Israel},  
"A vineyard of [^a]wine, sing in praise of it!  
###### 3
"I, the LORD, am its Keeper;  
I water it every moment.  
So that no one will harm it,  
I guard it night and day.  
###### 4
"I have no wrath.  
Should anyone give Me briars *and* thorns in battle,  
I would step on them, I would set them all on fire.  
###### 5
"Or let him (Israel) cling to My strength *and* rely on My protection {My stronghold},  
Let him make peace with Me,  
Let him make peace with Me."  
###### 6
In[^b] the generations to come Jacob will take root;
Israel will blossom and sprout,  
And they will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
###### 7
Like the striking [^c]by Him who has struck them, has He struck them?  
Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain?  
###### 8
You contended with them by exile, by driving them away {from Canaan};  
He has expelled them with His fierce wind on the day of the east wind.  
###### 9
Therefore through this the wickedness {the sin, the injustice, the wrongdoing} of Jacob (Israel) will be atoned for *and* forgiven;  
And this will be [^d]the full price {that God requires} for taking away his sin:  
When Israel makes all the stones of the {pagan} altars like crushed chalk stones;  
When the Asherim and the incense altars will not stand.  
###### 10
For the fortified city is isolated,  
A settlement deserted and abandoned like the desert;  
There the calf will graze,  
And there it will lie down and [^e]feed on its branches.  
###### 11
When its branches are dry, they are broken off;  
The women come and [^f]make a fire with them.  
For they are not a people of understanding,  
Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them,  
And He who created them will not be gracious to them.
###### 12
In that day the LORD will thresh {out His grain} from the flowing stream of the River {Euphrates} to the Brook of Egypt, and you will be gathered up one by one, O sons of Israel.  
###### 13
It will come to pass in that day that a great trumpet will be blown, and those who were lost *and* perishing in the land of Assyria and who were scattered in the land of Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

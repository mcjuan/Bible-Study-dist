## A Glorified Zion
###### 1
"Arise {from spiritual depression to a new life}, shine {be radiant with the glory *and* brilliance of the LORD}; for your light has come,  
And the glory *and* brilliance of the LORD has risen upon you.  
###### 2
"For in fact, darkness will cover the earth  
And deep darkness *will cover* the peoples;  
But the LORD will rise upon you {Jerusalem}  
And His glory *and* brilliance will be seen on you.  
###### 3
"Nations will come to your light,  
And kings to the brightness of your rising.
###### 4
"Lift up your eyes around you and see;  
They all gather together, they come to you.  
Your sons will come from far away,  
And your daughters will be looked after at *their* side.  
###### 5
"Then you will see and be radiant,  
And your heart will tremble {with joy} and rejoice  
Because the abundant wealth of the seas will [^a]be brought to you,  
The wealth of the nations will come to you.  
###### 6
"A multitude of camels {from the eastern trading tribes} will cover you {Jerusalem},  
The young camels of Midian and Ephah;  
All those from Sheba {who once came to trade} will come  
Bringing gold and frankincense  
And proclaiming the praises of the LORD.  
###### 7
"All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you {as the eastern pastoral tribes join the trading tribes},  
The rams of Nebaioth will serve you;  
They will go up with acceptance {as sacrifices} on My altar,  
And I will glorify the house of My honor *and* splendor.  
###### 8
"Who are these who fly like a cloud  
And like doves to their windows?  
###### 9
"The islands *and* coastlands will confidently wait for Me;  
And the ships of Tarshish *will come* first,  
To bring your sons from far away,  
Their silver and gold with them,  
For the name of the LORD your God,  
For the Holy One of Israel because He has glorified you.
###### 10
"Foreigners will build up your walls,  
And their kings will serve you;  
For in My {righteous} wrath I struck you,  
But in My favor *and* grace I have had compassion on you.  
###### 11
"Your gates will be open continually;  
They shall not be shut day or night,  
So that people may bring to you the wealth of the nations--  
With their kings led in procession.  
###### 12
"For the nation or the kingdom which will not serve you {Jerusalem} shall perish,  
And the nations {that refuse to serve} shall be utterly ruined.  
###### 13
"The glory of Lebanon will come to you,  
The [^b]cypress, the juniper, and the cedar together,  
To beautify the place of My sanctuary;  
And I will honor *and* make the place of My feet glorious.  
###### 14
"The sons of those who oppressed you will come bowing down to you {in submission},  
And all those who despised you *and* treated you disrespectfully will bow down at the soles of your feet,  
And they will call you the City of the LORD,  
The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
###### 15
"Whereas you {Jerusalem} have been abandoned and hated  
With no one passing through,  
I will make you an object of pride forever,  
A joy from generation to generation.  
###### 16
"You will suck the milk of the {Gentile} nations  
And suck the breast (abundance) of kings;  
Then you will recognize *and* know that I, the LORD, am your Savior  
And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.  
###### 17
"Instead of bronze I will bring gold,  
And instead of iron I will bring silver,  
And instead of wood, bronze,  
And instead of stones, iron.  
And {instead of the tyranny of the present} I will appoint peace as your officers,  
And righteousness your rulers.  
###### 18
"Violence will not be heard again in your land,  
Nor devastation or destruction within your borders;  
But you will call your walls Salvation, and your gates Praise {to God}.  
###### 19
"The sun will no longer be your light by day,  
Nor shall the bright glow of the moon give light to you,  
But the LORD will be an everlasting light for you;  
And your God will be your glory *and* splendor.  
###### 20
"Your sun will no longer set,  
Nor will your moon wane;  
For the LORD will be your everlasting light,  
And the days of your mourning will be over.  
###### 21
"Then all your people will be {uncompromisingly and consistently} righteous;  
They will possess the land forever,  
The branch of My planting,  
The work of My hands,  
That I may be glorified.  
###### 22
"The smallest one will become a thousand (a clan),  
And the least one a mighty nation.  
I, the LORD, will quicken it in its {appointed} time."

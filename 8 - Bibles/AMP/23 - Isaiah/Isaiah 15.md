## Judgment on Moab
###### 1
The {mournful, inspired} oracle ([^a]a burden to be carried) concerning Moab:
Because in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined;  
Because in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.  
###### 2
They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep.  
Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba;  
Everyone's head is shaved, and every beard is cut off {in mourning}.  
###### 3
In their streets they have wrapped themselves with sackcloth;  
On their {flat} housetops and in their open squares  
Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.  
###### 4
Heshbon and Elealeh {cities claimed by Moab} cry out;  
Their voice is heard as far as Jahaz.  
Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out;  
Moab's soul trembles within him.  
###### 5
My heart cries out for Moab;  
His fugitives are {fleeing} as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah.  
For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping;  
For on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their destruction.  
###### 6
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.  
Indeed the grass is withered, the new growth dies;  
There is no green thing.  
###### 7
Therefore the abundance *which* they have acquired and stored away  
They carry off over the Brook of the Willows.  
###### 8
For the cry of distress has echoed around the territory of Moab;  
The wailing *goes* as far as Eglaim and the mournful cry to Beer-elim.  
###### 9
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;  
Yet I will bring even more *woes* on Dimon--  
A lion upon those of Moab who escape and upon the remnant of the land.

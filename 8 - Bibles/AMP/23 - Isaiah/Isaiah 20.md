## Prophecy about Egypt and Cush (Ancient Ethiopia)
###### 1
In the year that the Tartan {the Assyrian commander in chief} came to Ashdod {in Philistia}, when Sargon king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,  
###### 2
at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, "Go, untie the [^a]sackcloth from your hips and take your sandals off your feet." And he did so, walking around [^b]stripped {to his loincloth} and barefoot.  
###### 3
And the LORD said, "Even as My servant Isaiah has walked [^c]stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign and forewarning concerning Egypt and Cush (Ethiopia),  
###### 4
in the same way the king of Assyria will lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, young and old, stripped and barefoot, even with buttocks uncovered--to the [^d]shame of Egypt.  
###### 5
Then they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and Egypt their boast.  
###### 6
So the inhabitants of this coastland {the Israelites and their neighbors} will say in that day, 'Look what has happened to those in whom we hoped *and* trusted and to whom we fled for help to be spared from the king of Assyria! But we, how will we escape {captivity and exile}?'"

### Footnotes
[^a]: Isaiah 20:2 A coarse cloth usually made of goat hair or camel hair and worn as a sign of mourning, or worn by prophets.
[^b]: Isaiah 20:2 Or *naked*. The Hebrew can refer to someone completely naked, or only stripped to the underwear (i.e. a loincloth); see note v 4. The ancient rabbis were particularly sensitive to the issue, and some maintained (contrary to the text) that Isaiah was wearing worn-out clothes and patched shoes or sandals.
[^c]: Isaiah 20:3 Stripping off the outer garments was an act symbolizing disgrace and humiliation.
[^d]: Isaiah 20:4 Lit *nakedness*. As noted for v 2, the Hebrew can refer to complete nakedness or to being stripped to the underwear. A loincloth might leave the buttocks exposed to a greater or lesser extent.

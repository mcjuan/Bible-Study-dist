## Damascus and Samaria Fall
###### 1
Then the LORD said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet {for public display} and write on it in ordinary characters: *Belonging* to [^a]Maher-shalal-hash-baz.  
###### 2
And I will get faithful witnesses to attest {to this prophecy} for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."  
###### 3
So I approached {my wife} the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz {to remind the people of the prophecy};  
###### 4
for before the boy knows how to say, 'My father' or 'My mother,' the riches of Damascus (Aram's capital) and the spoil of Samaria (Israel's capital) [^b]will be carried away by the king of Assyria."
###### 5
Again the LORD spoke to me, saying,
###### 6
"Because these people (Judah) have refused the gently flowing waters of [^c]Shiloah  
And rejoice in Rezin {the king of Aram} and Remaliah's son {Pekah the king of Israel},  
###### 7
Now therefore, listen carefully, the Lord is about to bring on them the waters of the {Euphrates} River, strong and abundant--  
The king of Assyria and all his glory;  
And it will rise over all its channels *and* canals and go far beyond its banks.  
###### 8
"Then it will [^d]sweep on into Judah; it will overflow and pass through {the hills},  
Reaching even to the neck {of which Jerusalem is the head},  
And its outstretched wings (the armies of Assyria) will fill the width of Your land, O Immanuel.

## A Believing Remnant
###### 9
"Be broken {in pieces}, O peoples, and be shattered!  
Listen, all you {our enemies from the} far countries.  
Prepare yourselves {for war}, and be shattered;  
Prepare yourselves {for war}, and be shattered.  
###### 10
"Take counsel together {against Judah}, but it will come to nothing;  
Speak the word, but it will not stand,  
For God is with us (Immanuel)."
###### 11
For in this way the LORD spoke to me with His strong hand {upon me} and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people {behaving as they do}, saying,
###### 12
"You are not to say, 'It is a conspiracy!'  
In regard to all that this people call a conspiracy,  
And you are not to fear what they fear nor be in dread of it.  
###### 13
"It is the LORD of hosts whom you are to regard as holy *and* awesome.  
He shall be your {source of} fear,  
He shall be your {source of} dread {not man}.  
###### 14
"Then He shall be a sanctuary {a sacred, indestructible shelter for those who fear and trust Him};  
But to both the houses of Israel {both the northern and southern kingdoms--Israel and Judah, He will be} a stone on which to stumble and a rock on which to trip,  
A trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
###### 15
"Many {among them} will stumble over them;  
Then they will fall and be broken,  
They will even be snared and trapped."
###### 16
Bind up the testimony, seal the law *and* the teaching among my (Isaiah's) disciples.  
###### 17
And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; and I will look eagerly for Him.  
###### 18
Listen carefully, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are [^e]for signs and wonders {that will occur} in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.
###### 19
When the people {instead of trusting God} say to you, "Consult the mediums {who try to talk to the dead} and the soothsayers who chirp *and* whisper and mutter," should not a people consult their God? *Should they consult* the dead on behalf of the living?  
###### 20
{Direct those people} to the law and to the testimony! If their teachings are not in accord with this word, it is because they have no dawn.  
###### 21
They {who consult mediums and soothsayers} will pass through the land deeply distressed and hungry, and when they are hungry, they will become enraged and will curse their king and their God as they look upward.  
###### 22
Then they will look to the earth, they will see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and *they will be* driven away into darkness *and* overwhelming night.

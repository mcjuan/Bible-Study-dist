## Exaltation of the Afflicted
###### 1
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,  
Because the LORD has anointed *and* commissioned me  
To bring good news to the humble *and* afflicted;  
He has sent me to bind up {the wounds of} the brokenhearted,  
To proclaim release {from confinement and condemnation} to the {physical and spiritual} captives  
And freedom to prisoners,  
###### 2
To proclaim [^a]the favorable year of the LORD,  
And[^b] the day of vengeance *and* retribution of our God,
To comfort all who mourn,  
###### 3
To grant to those who mourn in Zion *the following*:  
To give them a [^c]turban instead of dust {on their heads, a sign of mourning},  
The oil of joy instead of mourning,  
The garment {expressive} of praise instead of a disheartened spirit.  
So they will be called the trees of righteousness {strong and magnificent, distinguished for integrity, justice, and right standing with God},  
The planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
###### 4
Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins,  
They will raise up *and* restore the former desolations;  
And they will renew the ruined cities,  
The desolations (deserted settlements) of many generations.  
###### 5
Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,  
And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.  
###### 6
But you shall be called the priests of the LORD;  
People will speak of you as the ministers of our God.  
You will eat the wealth of nations,  
And you will boast of their riches.  
###### 7
Instead of your {former} shame *you will have* a [^d]double *portion*;  
And *instead of* humiliation your people will shout for joy over their portion.  
Therefore in their land they will possess double {what they had forfeited};  
Everlasting joy will be theirs.  
###### 8
For I, the LORD, love justice;  
I hate robbery with [^e]a burnt offering.  
And I will faithfully reward them,  
And make an everlasting covenant with them.  
###### 9
Then their offspring will be known among the nations,  
And their descendants among the peoples.  
All who see them {in their prosperity} will recognize *and* acknowledge them  
That they are the people whom the LORD has blessed.
###### 10
I will rejoice greatly in the LORD,  
My soul will exult in my God;  
For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,  
He has covered me with a robe of righteousness,  
As a bridegroom puts on a [^f]turban,  
And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.  
###### 11
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts,  
And as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,  
So the Lord God will {most certainly} cause righteousness *and* justice and praise  
To spring up before all the nations {through the power of His word}.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Isaiah 61:2 The same as *a day of salvation* (49:8), and *the year of my redeemed* (63:4).
[^b]: Isaiah 61:2 See note Ezek 34:28.
[^c]: Isaiah 61:3 In the Hebrew there is a kind of wordplay here as “turban” (Heb *pe’er)* and dust (*epher*) have the same consonants and similar vowels.
[^d]: Isaiah 61:7 I.e. abundant reward.
[^e]: Isaiah 61:8 Another reading is *wrongdoing* or *malice*, but by itself either would hardly be an improvement. Some prefer to read *with* as “and,” which requires the assumption of a scribal error that is possible though not found in existing manuscripts. It would also raise the question of why *robbery* is singled out among other kinds of wrongdoing. In the Talmud the verse is taken to refer literally to the theft of an animal which the thief intends to offer as a sacrifice. The point is that the offering is unacceptable even though everything actually belongs to God and the thief arguably is only returning to God what is His.
[^f]: Isaiah 61:10 Or *head wrap*.

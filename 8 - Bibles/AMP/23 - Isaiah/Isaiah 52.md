## Cheer for Downtrodden Zion
###### 1
Awake, awake,  
Put on your strength, O Zion;  
Put on your beautiful garments,  
O Jerusalem, the holy city;  
For the uncircumcised and the unclean  
Will no longer come into you.  
###### 2
Shake yourself from the dust, arise,  
O captive Jerusalem;  
Rid yourself of the chains around your neck,  
O captive Daughter of Zion.
###### 3
For the LORD says this, "You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed, but not with money."  
###### 4
For the Lord God says this, "My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there; and {many years later Sennacherib} the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.  
###### 5
But now, what do I have here," declares the LORD, "seeing that My people have been taken away without reason? Those who rule over them howl {with taunting and mockery of salvation}," declares the LORD, "and My name is continually blasphemed all day long.  
###### 6
Therefore My people shall know My Name *and* what it means. Therefore in that day I am the One who is speaking, 'Here I am.'"
###### 7
How beautiful *and* delightful on the mountains  
Are the feet of him who brings good news,  
Who announces peace,  
Who brings good news of good {things},  
Who announces salvation,  
Who says to Zion, "Your God reigns!"  
###### 8
Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices,  
Together they shout for joy;  
For they will see face to face  
The return of the LORD to Zion.  
###### 9
Break forth, shout joyfully together,  
You ruins of Jerusalem;  
For the LORD has comforted His people,  
He has redeemed Jerusalem.  
###### 10
The LORD has bared His holy arm (His infinite power)  
Before the eyes of all the nations {revealing Himself as the One by Whom Israel is redeemed from captivity},  
That all the ends of the earth may see  
The salvation of our God.
###### 11
Depart, depart, go out from there (the lands of exile),  
Touch no unclean thing;  
Go out of the midst of her (Babylon), purify yourselves,  
You who carry the articles of the LORD {on your journey from there}.  
###### 12
For you will not go out in a hurry {as when you left Egypt},  
Nor will you go in flight {fleeing, as you did from the Egyptians};  
For the LORD will go before you,  
And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.

## The Exalted Servant
###### 13
Indeed, My Servant (the Messiah) will act wisely *and* prosper;  
He will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted.  
###### 14
Just as many were astonished *and* appalled at you, *My people*,  
So His appearance was marred more than any man  
And His form {marred} more than the sons of men.  
###### 15
So He will sprinkle many nations {with His blood, providing salvation},  
Kings will shut their mouths because of Him;  
For what they had not been told they will see,  
And what they had not heard they will understand.

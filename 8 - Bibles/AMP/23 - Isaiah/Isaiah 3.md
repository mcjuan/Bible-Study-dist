## God Will Remove the Leaders
###### 1
Listen carefully, the Lord God of hosts is removing from Jerusalem and from Judah  
Both supply and support, the whole supply of bread  
And the whole supply of water;  
###### 2
The brave man and the warrior {He is also removing},  
The judge and the prophet,  
The diviner and the elder,  
###### 3
The captain of fifty and the man of honor,  
The counselor and the expert artisan,  
And the skillful enchanter.  
###### 4
And I will make *mere* boys their princes,  
And capricious (impulsive, unpredictable) children will rule over them.  
###### 5
And the people will be oppressed,  
Each one by another, and each one by his neighbor;  
The boy will be arrogant *and* insolent toward the elder  
And the vulgar (common) toward the honorable {person of rank}.  
###### 6
When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, *saying*,  
"You have a robe, you shall be our judge *and* ruler,  
And this pile of ruins will be under your control,"  
###### 7
He will protest on that day, saying,  
"I will not be a [^a]governor;  
For in my house there is neither bread nor clothing;  
You should not make me a judge *and* ruler of the people."  
###### 8
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,  
Because their words and their actions are against the LORD,  
To rebel against His glorious presence *and* defiantly provoke Him.  
###### 9
Their partiality testifies against them,  
They display their sin like Sodom;  
They do not even hide it.  
Woe (judgment is coming) to [^b]them!  
For they have brought evil on themselves {as a reward}.  
###### 10
Say to the righteous that *it will go* well with them,  
For they will eat the fruit of their {righteous} actions.  
###### 11
Woe (judgment is coming) to the wicked! *It shall go* badly *with him*,  
For what his hand has done shall be done to him.  
###### 12
O My people! Children are their oppressors,  
And women rule over them.  
O My people! Your leaders lead you astray  
And confuse (destroy, swallow up) the direction of your paths.

## God Will Judge
###### 13
The LORD rises to contend,  
And stands to judge the people.  
###### 14
The LORD enters into judgment with the elders of His people and their princes,  
"For it is you who have devoured the vineyard {with your oppression, you have robbed the people and ruined the country};  
The plunder of the poor is in your houses.  
###### 15
"What do you mean by crushing My people  
And grinding the face of the poor?"  
Declares the Lord God of hosts.

## Judah's Women Denounced
###### 16
Moreover, the LORD said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud  
And walk with outstretched necks and seductive (flirtatious, alluring) eyes,  
And trip along with mincing steps *and* an affected gait  
And walk with jingling [^c]anklets on their feet,  
###### 17
Therefore the Lord will afflict the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion with scabs {making them bald},  
And the LORD will expose their foreheads (send them into captivity)."
###### 18
In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, {braided} caps, crescent {head} ornaments,  
###### 19
dangling earrings, bracelets, and the hanging veils *and* scarves,  
###### 20
head wraps (turbans), {short, jingling} ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets (charms),  
###### 21
signet {finger} rings, nose rings,  
###### 22
festival robes, outer tunics, shawls, handbags,  
###### 23
hand mirrors, {fine linen} undergarments, headbands, and veils {covering the entire body}.
###### 24
Now it will come to pass that instead of the sweet fragrance of spices there will be {the stench of} rottenness;  
Instead of a belt, a rope;  
Instead of well-set hair, baldness;  
Instead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth;  
And branding {of captives by the scorching heat} instead of beauty.  
###### 25
Your men will fall by the sword  
And your mighty men in battle.  
###### 26
And Jerusalem's gates will lament (cry out in grief) and mourn {as those who wail for the dead};  
And she, being ruined *and* desolate, will sit upon the ground.

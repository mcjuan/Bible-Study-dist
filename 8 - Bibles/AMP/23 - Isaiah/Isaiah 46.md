## Babylon's Idols and the True God
###### 1
Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over;  
Their idols are on the beasts {of burden} and on the cattle.  
Your burdens {of idols} are loaded {on them},  
Burdens on the weary *animals*.  
###### 2
They stooped over, they have bowed down together;  
They could not rescue the burden {of their own idols},  
But have themselves gone into captivity.
###### 3
"Listen to Me," {says the LORD}, "O house of Jacob,  
And all the remnant of the house of Israel,  
You who have been carried *by Me* from your birth  
And have been carried {in My arms} from the womb,  
###### 4
Even to *your* old age I am He,  
And even to *your* advanced old age I will carry you!  
I have made *you*, and I will carry *you*;  
Be assured I will carry *you* and I will save *you*.
###### 5
"To whom would you liken Me  
And make Me equal and compare Me,  
That we may be alike?  
###### 6
"Those who lavish gold from the bag  
And weigh out silver on the scales  
Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it *into* a god;  
They bow down, indeed they worship it.  
###### 7
"They lift it on their shoulders {in religious processions or into battle} and carry it;  
They set it in its place and *there* it remains standing.  
It cannot move from its place.  
Even if one cries to it {for help}, the idol cannot answer;  
It cannot save him from his distress.
###### 8
"Remember this, and take courage;  
Take it to heart, you rebellious *and* disloyal people.  
###### 9
"Remember {carefully} the former things {which I did} from ages past;  
For I am God, and there is no one else;  
*I am* God, and there is no one like Me,  
###### 10
Declaring the end *and* the result from the beginning,  
And from ancient times the things which have not {yet} been done,  
Saying, 'My purpose will be established,  
And I will do all that pleases Me *and* fulfills My purpose,'  
###### 11
Calling a bird of prey from the east,  
From a far country, the man (Cyrus) of My purpose.  
Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.  
I have planned it, *be assured* I will do it.
###### 12
"Listen to Me, you stiff-necked *people*,  
You who are far from righteousness (right standing with God).  
###### 13
"I bring near My righteousness {in the salvation of Israel}, it is not far away;  
And My salvation will not delay.  
And I will grant salvation in Zion,  
And My glory for Israel.

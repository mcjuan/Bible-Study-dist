## The Suffering Servant
###### 1
Who has believed {confidently trusted in, relied on, and adhered to} our message {of salvation}?  
And to whom {if not us} has the arm *and* infinite power of the LORD been revealed?  
###### 2
For He {the Servant of God} grew up before Him like a tender shoot (plant),  
And like a root out of dry ground;  
He has no *stately* form or *majestic* splendor  
That we would look at Him,  
Nor {handsome} appearance that we would [^a]be attracted to Him.  
###### 3
He was despised and rejected by men,  
A Man of sorrows *and* pain and acquainted with grief;  
And like One from whom men hide their faces  
He was despised, and we did not appreciate His worth *or* esteem Him.
###### 4
But {in fact} He has borne our griefs,  
And He has carried our sorrows *and* pains;  
Yet we {ignorantly} assumed that He was stricken,  
Struck down by God and degraded *and* humiliated {by Him}.  
###### 5
But He was wounded for our transgressions,  
He was crushed for our wickedness {our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing};  
The punishment {required} for our well-being *fell* on Him,  
And by His stripes (wounds) we are healed.  
###### 6
All of us like sheep have gone astray,  
We have turned, each one, to his own way;  
But the LORD has caused the wickedness of us all {our sin, our injustice, our wrongdoing}  
To fall on Him {instead of us}.
###### 7
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,  
Yet He did not open His mouth {to complain or defend Himself};  
Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,  
And like a sheep that is silent before her shearers,  
So He did not open His mouth.  
###### 8
After[^b] oppression and judgment He was taken away;
And [^c]as for His generation {His contemporaries}, who {among them} concerned himself *with the fact*  
That He was cut off from the land of the living {by His death}  
For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke {of death} *was due*?  
###### 9
His grave was assigned with the wicked,  
But He was with a rich man in His death,  
Because He had done no violence,  
Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
###### 10
Yet the LORD was [^d]willing  
To crush Him, [^e]causing Him to suffer;  
If [^f]He would give Himself as a guilt offering {an atonement for sin},  
He shall see *His* {spiritual} offspring,  
He shall prolong *His* days,  
And the will (good pleasure) of the LORD shall succeed *and* prosper in His hand.  
###### 11
As a result of the [^g]anguish of His soul,  
He shall see it and be satisfied;  
By His knowledge {of what He has accomplished} the Righteous One,  
My Servant, shall justify the many {making them righteous--upright before God, in right standing with Him},  
For He shall bear {the responsibility for} their sins.  
###### 12
Therefore, I will divide *and* give Him a portion with the great {kings and rulers},  
And He shall divide the spoils with the mighty,  
Because He {willingly} poured out His life to death,  
And was counted among the transgressors;  
Yet He Himself bore *and* took away the sin of many,  
And interceded {with the Father} for the transgressors.

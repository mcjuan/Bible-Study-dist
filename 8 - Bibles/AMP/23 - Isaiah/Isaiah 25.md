## Song of Praise for God's Favor
###### 1
O LORD, You are my God;  
I will exalt You, I will praise *and* give thanks to Your name;  
For You have done miraculous things,  
Plans *formed* long, long ago, {fulfilled} with perfect faithfulness.  
###### 2
For You have made a city into a heap {of trash},  
A fortified city into a ruin;  
A palace of [^a]foreigners is no longer a city,  
It will never be rebuilt.  
###### 3
Therefore a strong people will honor You;  
Cities of terrible *and* violent nations will fear You.  
###### 4
For You have been a stronghold for the helpless,  
A stronghold for the poor in his distress,  
A shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat;  
For the breath of tyrants  
Is like a rainstorm *against* a wall.  
###### 5
Like heat in a dry land, You will subdue the noise of foreigners {rejoicing over their enemies};  
Like heat in the shadow of a cloud, the song of the tyrants is [^b]silenced.
###### 6
On this mountain {Zion} the LORD of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples {to welcome His reign on earth},  
A banquet of aged wines--choice pieces {flavored} with marrow,  
Of refined, aged wines.  
###### 7
And on this mountain He will destroy the covering that is {cast} over all peoples,  
And the veil {of death} that is woven *and* spread over all the nations.  
###### 8
He will swallow up death {and abolish it} for all time.  
And the Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces,  
And He will take away the disgrace of His people from all the earth;  
For the LORD has spoken.  
###### 9
It will be said in that day,  
"Indeed, this is our God for whom we have waited that He would save us.  
This is the LORD for whom we have waited;  
Let us shout for joy and rejoice in His salvation."  
###### 10
For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain {Zion},  
And Moab will be trampled down in his place  
As straw is trampled down in the {filthy} water of a manure pile.  
###### 11
And Moab will spread out his hands in the middle of the filth  
As a swimmer spreads out *his hands* to swim,  
But *the Lord* will humiliate his pride in spite of the {skillful} movements of his hands.  
###### 12
The high fortifications of your walls He will bring down,  
Lay low, and cast to the ground, to the dust.

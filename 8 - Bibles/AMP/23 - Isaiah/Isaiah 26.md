## Song of Trust in God's Protection
###### 1
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
"We have a strong city;  
He sets up salvation as walls and ramparts.  
###### 2
"Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter,  
The one that [^a]remains faithful *and* trustworthy.  
###### 3
"You will keep in [^b]perfect *and* constant peace *the one* whose mind is steadfast {that is, committed and focused on You--in both [^c]inclination and character},  
Because he trusts *and* takes refuge in You {with hope and confident expectation}.  
###### 4
"Trust {confidently} in the LORD forever {He is your fortress, your shield, your banner},  
For the Lord God is an everlasting Rock {the Rock of Ages}.  
###### 5
"For He has thrown down the {arrogant} ones who dwell on high, the lofty *and* inaccessible city;  
He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He hurls it to the dust.  
###### 6
"The foot will trample it,  
*Even* the feet of the suffering, and the steps of the helpless."
###### 7
The way of the righteous {those in right-standing with God--living in moral and spiritual integrity} is smooth *and* level;  
O Upright One, make a level path for the just *and* righteous.  
###### 8
Indeed, in the path of Your judgments, O LORD,  
We have waited expectantly for You;  
Your name, even Your memory, is the desire *and* deep longing of our souls.  
###### 9
In the night my soul longs for You {O LORD},  
Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently;  
For {only} when Your judgments are experienced on the earth  
Will the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.  
###### 10
*Though* the wicked is shown compassion *and* favor,  
He does not learn righteousness;  
In the land of uprightness he deals unjustly,  
And refuses to see the majesty of the LORD.
###### 11
*Though* Your hand is lifted up {to strike}, O LORD, the wicked do not see it.  
Let them see Your zeal for *Your* people and be put to shame;  
Indeed, let the fire reserved for Your enemies consume them.  
###### 12
LORD, You will establish peace for us,  
Since You have also performed for us all that we have done.  
###### 13
O LORD our God, other masters besides You have ruled over us;  
But through You alone we confess Your name.  
###### 14
The {wicked} dead will not live {again}, the spirits of the dead will not rise *and* return;  
Therefore You have punished and destroyed them,  
And You have wiped out every memory of them {every trace of them}.  
###### 15
You have increased the nation, O LORD;  
You have increased the nation, You are glorified;  
You have extended all the borders of the land.  
###### 16
O LORD, they sought You in distress;  
They managed only a prayerful whisper  
When Your discipline was upon them.  
###### 17
As a woman with child approaches *the time* to give birth,  
She is in pain *and* struggles and cries out in her labor,  
So we were before You, O LORD.  
###### 18
We have been with child, we have twisted *and* struggled *in labor*;  
We gave birth, as it seems, *only* to wind.  
We could not accomplish salvation for the earth,  
Nor were inhabitants of the world [^d]born.  
###### 19
Your dead will live;  
Their[^e] dead bodies will rise.
You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy!  
For your dew is a dew of {celestial} light {heavenly, supernatural},  
And the earth will give birth to the spirits of the dead.
###### 20
Come, my people, enter your chambers  
And shut your doors behind you;  
Hide for a little while  
Until the {Lord's} [^f]wrath is past.  
###### 21
Listen carefully, the LORD is about to come out of His {heavenly} place  
To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their wickedness {their sin, their injustice, their wrongdoing};  
The earth will reveal the {innocent} blood shed upon her  
And will no longer cover her slain.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Isaiah 26:2 Lit *keeps trustworthiness*.
[^b]: Isaiah 26:3 Lit *peace, peace*, a Hebrew idiom of emphasis.
[^c]: Isaiah 26:3 The Hebrew word for *inclination* became a technical term in Jewish tradition, and the rabbis frequently referred to the “evil inclination” much in the same sense as the sin nature. They also recognized a “good inclination,” which the righteous choose to follow, and urged people to make their good inclination king over the evil inclination.
[^d]: Isaiah 26:18 Lit *fallen*.
[^e]: Isaiah 26:19 So with some ancient versions; MT reads *My dead body*.

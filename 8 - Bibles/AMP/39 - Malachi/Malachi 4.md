## Final Admonition
###### 1
"For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace, and all the arrogant (proud, self-righteous, haughty), and every evildoer shall be stubble; and the day that is coming shall set them on fire," says the LORD of hosts, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.  
###### 2
But for you who fear My name {with awe-filled reverence} the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings. And you will go forward and leap {joyfully} like calves {released} from the stall.  
###### 3
You will trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I do this," says the LORD of hosts.
###### 4
"Remember {with thoughtful concern} the Law of Moses My servant, the statutes and the ordinances which I commanded him on {Mount} Horeb {to give} to all Israel.
###### 5
"Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD.  
###### 6
He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers {a reconciliation produced by repentance}, so that I will not come and strike the land with a curse {of complete destruction}."

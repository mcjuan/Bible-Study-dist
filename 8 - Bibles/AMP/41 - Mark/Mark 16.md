## The Resurrection
###### 1
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the *mother* of James, and Salome purchased {sweet-smelling} spices, so that they might go and [^a]anoint Him.  
###### 2
Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.  
###### 3
And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"  
###### 4
Looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, though it was extremely large.  
###### 5
Entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a {long, stately} white robe; and they were amazed *and* bewildered.  
###### 6
And he said to them, "Do not be amazed; you are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See, {here is} the place where they laid Him.  
###### 7
But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see Him there, just as He told you.'"  
###### 8
They went out and fled from the tomb, for they were seized with trembling and astonishment; and they said nothing {about it} to anyone, because they were afraid.
###### 9
{Now[^b] Jesus, having risen {from death} early on the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
###### 10
She went and reported it to those who had been with Him, while they were mourning and weeping.  
###### 11
When they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.
###### 12
After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking along the way to the country.  
###### 13
They returned {to Jerusalem} and told the others, but they did not believe them either.

## The Disciples Commissioned
###### 14
Later, Jesus appeared to the eleven {disciples} themselves as they were reclining *at the table*; and He called them to account for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen {from death}.  
###### 15
And He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.  
###### 16
He who has believed {in Me} and has been baptized will be saved {from the penalty of God's wrath and judgment}; but he who has not believed will be condemned.  
###### 17
These signs will accompany those who have believed: in My name they will cast out demons, they will speak in new tongues;  
###### 18
they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well."
###### 19
So then, when the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  
###### 20
And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord was working with them and confirming the word by the signs that followed.}

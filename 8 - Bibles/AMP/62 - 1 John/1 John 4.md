## Testing the Spirits
###### 1
Beloved, do not believe every spirit {speaking through a self-proclaimed prophet}; instead test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets *and* teachers have gone out into the world.  
###### 2
By this you know *and* recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges *and* confesses {the fact} that Jesus Christ has {actually} come in the flesh {as a man} is from God {God is its source};  
###### 3
and every spirit that does not confess Jesus {acknowledging that He has come in the flesh, but would deny any of the Son's true nature} is not of God; this is the *spirit* of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and is now already in the world.  
###### 4
Little children (believers, dear ones), you are of God *and* you belong to Him and have {already} overcome them {the agents of the antichrist}; because He who is in you is greater than he (Satan) who is in the world {of sinful mankind}.  
###### 5
They {who teach twisted doctrine} are of the world *and* belong to it; therefore they speak from the {viewpoint of the} world {with its immoral freedom and baseless theories--demanding compliance with their opinions and ridiculing the values of the upright}, and the {gullible one of the} world listens closely *and* pays attention to them.  
###### 6
We {who teach God's word} are from God {energized by the Holy Spirit}, and whoever knows God {through personal experience} listens to us {and has a deeper understanding of Him}. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know {without any doubt} the spirit of truth {motivated by God} and the spirit of error {motivated by Satan}.

## God Is Love
###### 7
Beloved, let us {unselfishly} [^a]love *and* seek the best for one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves {others} is born of God and knows God {through personal experience}.  
###### 8
The one who does not love has not become acquainted with God {does not and never did know Him}, for God is love. {He is the originator of love, and it is an enduring attribute of His nature.}  
###### 9
By this the love of God was displayed in us, in that God has sent His {One and} only begotten Son {the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind} into the world so that we might live through Him.  
###### 10
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation {that is, the atoning sacrifice, and the satisfying offering} for our sins {fulfilling God's requirement for justice against sin and placating His wrath}.  
###### 11
Beloved, if God so loved us {in this incredible way}, we also ought to love one another.  
###### 12
No one has seen God at any time. But if we love one another {with unselfish concern}, God abides in us, and His love {the love that is His essence abides in us and} is completed *and* perfected in us.  
###### 13
By this we know {with confident assurance} that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given to us His {Holy} Spirit.  
###### 14
We {who were with Him in person} have seen and testify {as eye-witnesses} that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.
###### 15
Whoever confesses *and* acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.  
###### 16
We have come to know {by personal observation and experience}, and have believed {with deep, consistent faith} the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides *continually* in him.  
###### 17
In this {union and fellowship with Him}, love is completed *and* perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment {with assurance and boldness to face Him}; because as He is, so are we in this world.  
###### 18
There is no fear in love {dread does not exist}. But perfect (complete, full-grown) love drives out fear, because fear involves {the expectation of divine} punishment, so the one who is afraid {of God's judgment} is not perfected in love {has not grown into a sufficient understanding of God's love}.  
###### 19
We love, because [^b]He first loved us.  
###### 20
If anyone says, "I love God," and hates (works against) his {Christian} brother he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.  
###### 21
And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should also {unselfishly} love his brother *and* seek the best for him.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 John 4:7 See note 2:10.
[^b]: 1 John 4:19 Because God bestowed on humanity a free will, man is not forced to love Him, but rather consciously and freely chooses the response he makes to God’s love.

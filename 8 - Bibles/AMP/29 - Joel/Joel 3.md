## The Nations Will Be Judged
###### 1
"For behold, in those {climactic} days and at that time,  
When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,  
###### 2
I will gather together all the {Gentile} nations {that were hostile to My people}  
And bring them down into the Valley of Jehoshaphat (the LORD has judged).  
And there I will deal with them *and* enter into judgment with them there  
For {their treatment of} My people, My inheritance, Israel,  
Whom they have scattered among the nations,  
And {because} they have encroached on My land *and* divided it up.  
###### 3
"They have also cast lots for My people,  
And have traded a boy for a prostitute  
And have sold a girl for wine that they may drink.
###### 4
Moreover, what are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon and all the {five small} regions of Philistia? Will you pay Me back for something {I have supposedly done to you}? Even if you do pay Me back, I will swiftly and speedily return your deed {of retaliation} on your own head.  
###### 5
Because you have taken My silver and My gold and have carried My precious treasures to your temples *and* palaces,  
###### 6
and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the Greeks, so that you may send them far away from their territory,  
###### 7
behold, I am going to stir them up from the place where you have sold them {and return them to their land}, and I shall return your action {of retaliation} on your own head.  
###### 8
Also I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the [^a]Sabeans, to a distant nation," for the LORD has spoken.
###### 9
Proclaim this among the {pagan} nations:  
Prepare a war! Stir up the mighty men!  
Let all the men of war come near, let them come up!  
###### 10
Beat your plowshares into swords  
And your pruning hooks into spears;  
Let the weak say, "I am strong!"  
###### 11
Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,  
And gather yourselves there;  
Bring down, O LORD, Your mighty ones (Your warriors).  
###### 12
Let the nations be stirred {to action}  
And come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,  
For there I will sit to judge *and* punish  
All the surrounding nations.  
###### 13
Put in the sickle {of judgment}, for the harvest is ripe;  
Come, tread {the grapes}, for the wine press is full;  
The vats overflow, for the wickedness {of the people} is great.  
###### 14
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision (judgment)!  
For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision {when judgment is executed}.  
###### 15
The sun and the moon grow dark  
And the stars lose their brightness.  
###### 16
The LORD thunders *and* roars from Zion  
And utters His voice from Jerusalem {in judgment of His enemies},  
And the heavens and the earth tremble *and* shudder;  
But the LORD is a refuge for His people  
And a stronghold {of protection} to the children of Israel.  
###### 17
Then you will know *and* understand fully that I am the LORD your God,  
Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain.  
Then Jerusalem will be holy,  
And strangers {who do not belong} will no longer pass through it.

## Judah Will Be Blessed
###### 18
And in that day  
The mountains will drip with sweet wine  
And the hills will flow with milk;  
And all the brooks *and* riverbeds of Judah will flow with water,  
And a fountain will go out from the house of the LORD  
To water the {desert} Valley of Shittim.  
###### 19
Egypt will become a waste,  
And Edom will become a desolate wilderness,  
Because of their violence against the children of Judah,  
In whose land they have shed innocent blood.  
###### 20
But Judah shall be inhabited forever  
And Jerusalem from generation to generation.  
###### 21
And I shall avenge their blood which I have not avenged,  
For the LORD dwells in Zion.

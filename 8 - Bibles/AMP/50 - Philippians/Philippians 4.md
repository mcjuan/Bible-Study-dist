## Think of Excellence
###### 1
Therefore, my [^a]fellow believers, whom I love and long for, my delight and crown {my wreath of victory}, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
###### 2
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree *and* to work in harmony in the Lord.  
###### 3
Indeed, I ask you too, my true companion, to help these women {to keep on cooperating}, for they have shared my struggle in the {cause of the} gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.
###### 4
Rejoice in the Lord always {delight, take pleasure in Him}; again I will say, rejoice!  
###### 5
Let your gentle *spirit* {your graciousness, unselfishness, mercy, tolerance, and patience} be known to all people. The Lord is near.  
###### 6
Do not be anxious *or* worried about anything, but in everything {every circumstance and situation} by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, continue to make your {specific} requests known to God.  
###### 7
And the peace of God {that peace which reassures the heart, that peace} which transcends all understanding, {that peace which} stands guard over your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus {is yours}.
###### 8
Finally, [^b]believers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable *and* worthy of respect, whatever is right *and* confirmed by God's word, whatever is pure *and* wholesome, whatever is lovely *and* brings peace, whatever is admirable *and* of good repute; if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think *continually* on these things {center your mind on them, and implant them in your heart}.  
###### 9
The things which you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things {in daily life}, and the God {who is the source} of peace *and* well-being will be with you.

## God's Provisions
###### 10
I rejoiced greatly in the Lord, that now at last you have renewed your concern for me; indeed, you were concerned about me *before*, but you had no opportunity to show it.  
###### 11
Not that I speak from {any personal} need, for I have learned to be content {and self-sufficient through Christ, satisfied to the point where I am not disturbed or uneasy} regardless of my circumstances.  
###### 12
I know how to get along and live humbly {in difficult times}, and I also know how to enjoy abundance *and* live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret {of facing life}, whether well-fed or going hungry, whether having an abundance or being in need.  
###### 13
I can do all things {which He has called me to do} through Him who strengthens *and* empowers me {to fulfill His purpose--I am self-sufficient in Christ's sufficiency; I am ready for anything and equal to anything through Him who infuses me with inner strength and confident peace.}  
###### 14
Nevertheless, it was right of you to share {with me} in my difficulties.
###### 15
And you Philippians know that in the early days of preaching the gospel, after I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of [^c]giving and receiving except you alone;  
###### 16
for even in Thessalonica you sent *a gift* more than once for my needs.  
###### 17
Not that I seek the gift itself, but I do seek the profit which increases to your {heavenly} account {the blessing which is accumulating for you}.  
###### 18
But I have received everything in full and more; I am amply supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent me. They are the fragrant aroma of an offering, an acceptable sacrifice which God welcomes *and* in which He delights.  
###### 19
And my God will liberally supply (fill until full) your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.  
###### 20
To our God and Father be the glory [^d]forever and ever. Amen.
###### 21
Remember me to every [^e]saint in Christ Jesus. The [^f]brothers who are with me greet you.  
###### 22
All [^g]God's people wish to be remembered to you, especially those of Caesar's household.
###### 23
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

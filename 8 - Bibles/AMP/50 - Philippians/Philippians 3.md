## The Goal of Life
###### 1
Finally, my [^a]fellow believers, continue to rejoice *and* delight in the LORD. To write the same things again is no trouble for me, and it is a safeguard for you.
###### 2
Look out for the [^b]dogs {the Judaizers, the legalists}, look out for the troublemakers, look out for the [^c]false circumcision {those who claim circumcision is necessary for salvation};  
###### 3
for we {who are born-again have been reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, set apart for His purpose and} are the *true* circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God and glory *and* take pride *and* exult in Christ Jesus and place no confidence {in what we have or who we are} in the flesh--  
###### 4
though I myself might have {some grounds for} confidence in the flesh {if I were pursuing salvation by works}. If anyone else thinks that he has reason to be confident in the flesh {that is, in his own efforts to achieve salvation}, I *have* far more:  
###### 5
circumcised when I was eight days old, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews {an exemplary Hebrew}; as to the {observance of the} Law, a Pharisee;  
###### 6
as to my zeal {for Jewish tradition}, a persecutor of the church; and as to righteousness {supposed right living} which {my fellow Jews believe} is in the Law, I proved myself blameless.
###### 7
But whatever *former* things were gains to me {as I thought then}, these things {once regarded as advancements in merit} I have come to consider as loss {absolutely worthless} for the sake of Christ {and the purpose which He has given my life}.  
###### 8
But more than that, I count everything as loss compared to the priceless privilege *and* supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord {and of growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with Him--a joy unequaled}. For His sake I have lost everything, and I consider it all garbage, so that I may gain Christ,  
###### 9
and may be found in Him {believing and relying on Him}, not having any righteousness of my own derived from {my obedience to} the Law *and* its rituals, but {possessing} that {genuine righteousness} which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.  
###### 10
*And this, so* that I may know Him {experientially, becoming more thoroughly acquainted with Him, understanding the remarkable wonders of His Person more completely} and {in that same way experience} the power of His resurrection {which overflows and is active in believers}, and {that I may share} the fellowship of His sufferings, by being *continually* conformed {inwardly into His likeness even} to His death {dying as He did};  
###### 11
so[^d] that I may attain to the resurrection {that will raise me} from the dead.
###### 12
Not that I have already obtained it {this goal of being Christlike} or have already been made perfect, but I actively press on [^e]so that I may take hold of that {perfection} for which Christ Jesus took hold of me *and* made me His own.  
###### 13
Brothers[^f] and sisters, I do not consider that I have made it my own yet; but one thing *I do*: forgetting what *lies* behind and reaching forward to what *lies* ahead,
###### 14
I press on toward the goal to win the {heavenly} prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.  
###### 15
All of us who are mature {pursuing spiritual perfection} should have this attitude. And if in any respect you have a different attitude, that too God will make clear to you.  
###### 16
Only let us stay true to what we have already attained.
###### 17
Brothers and sisters, together follow my example and observe those who live by the pattern we gave you.  
###### 18
For there are many, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, who live as enemies of the cross of Christ {rejecting and opposing His way of salvation},  
###### 19
whose fate is destruction, whose god is *their* belly {their worldly appetite, their sensuality, their vanity}, and *whose* glory is in their shame--who focus their mind on earthly *and* temporal things.  
###### 20
But {we are different, because} our citizenship is in heaven. And from there we eagerly await {the coming of} the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;  
###### 21
who, by exerting that power which enables Him even to subject everything to Himself, will {not only} transform {but completely refashion} our *earthly* bodies so that they will be like His glorious *resurrected* body.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Philippians 3:1 Lit *brethren*.
[^b]: Philippians 3:2 Jews often used “dogs” as a derogatory term to refer to Gentiles, so Paul’s reference to his Jewish opponents in this verse is ironic. Most dogs were untamed scavengers and considered disgusting because they ate anything.
[^c]: Philippians 3:2 Because circumcision was not necessary for salvation, the circumcision demanded by the Judaizers was nothing more than mutilation.
[^d]: Philippians 3:11 Lit *if somehow*.
[^e]: Philippians 3:12 Lit *even if I may*. Paul knew that he could not really reach perfection in this life, but his goal was to “press on” as if it were attainable.
[^f]: Philippians 3:13 Lit *Brethren*.

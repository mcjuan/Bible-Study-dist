## David's Supporters in Ziklag
###### 1
These are the ones who came to David at Ziklag, while he still concealed himself from Saul the son of Kish; they were among the courageous men who helped him in battle.  
###### 2
They were armed with bows, and could use the right hand or the left to *sling* stones and *shoot* arrows from the bow; *they were* Saul's relatives from {the tribe of} Benjamin.  
###### 3
The chief was Ahiezer and then Joash, the sons of Shemaah of Gibeah; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, and Jehu of Anathoth,  
###### 4
Ishmaiah of Gibeon, a mighty man among the thirty, and {a leader} over them; [^a]Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad of Gederah,  
###### 5
Eluzai,[^b] Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite,
###### 6
Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites,  
###### 7
and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
###### 8
Courageous men from the Gadites came over to David in the stronghold in the wilderness, men trained for war, who could handle shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and who were swift as gazelles on the mountains.  
###### 9
Ezer was the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,  
###### 10
Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,  
###### 11
Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,  
###### 12
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,  
###### 13
Jeremiah the tenth, Machbannai the eleventh.  
###### 14
These from the sons (descendants) of Gad were captains of the army; he who was least was [^c]equal to a hundred, and the greatest was equal to a thousand.  
###### 15
These are the men who crossed over the Jordan in the first month when it had overflowed all its banks and they put to flight all those in the valleys, east and west.
###### 16
Then some of the [^d]men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.  
###### 17
David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come peacefully to me to help me, my heart shall be united with you; but if *you have come* to betray me to my adversaries, since there is no violence *or* wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers look on {what you are doing} and punish {you}."  
###### 18
Then the {Holy} Spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, *and he said*,
"We are yours, O David,  
And with you, O son of Jesse!  
Peace, peace be to you,  
And peace be to him who helps you;  
For your God helps you."
Then David accepted *and* received them and made them officers of his troops.
###### 19
Some {of the men} of Manasseh also defected to David when he came with the Philistines to go to battle against Saul. But David's men did not {actually} assist the Philistines, for the lords (governors) of the Philistines after consultation sent him away, saying, "At *the cost of* our heads he may defect to his master Saul."  
###### 20
As David went to Ziklag, *these men* defected to him from Manasseh: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands who belonged to Manasseh.  
###### 21
They helped David against the band of raiders, for they were all courageous men, and {all seven} became commanders in his army.  
###### 22
For day by day men kept coming to David to help him, until there was a great army, like the army of God.

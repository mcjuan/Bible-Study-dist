## Bildad Says God Rewards the Good
###### 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
###### 2
"How long will you say these things?  
And will the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?  
###### 3
"Does God pervert justice?  
Or does [^a]the Almighty pervert righteousness?  
###### 4
"If your children have sinned against Him,  
Then He has handed them over to the power of their transgression *and* punished them.  
###### 5
"If you would {diligently} seek God  
And implore the compassion *and* favor of the Almighty,  
###### 6
Then, if you are pure and upright,  
Surely now He will awaken for you  
And restore your righteous place.  
###### 7
"Though your beginning was insignificant,  
Yet your end will greatly increase.
###### 8
"Inquire, please, of past generations,  
And consider *and* apply yourself to the things searched out by their fathers.  
###### 9
"For we are *only* of yesterday and know nothing,  
Because our days on earth are {like} a shadow {just a breath or a vapor}.  
###### 10
"Will they (the fathers) not teach you *and* tell you,  
And utter words from their hearts {the deepest part of their nature}?
###### 11
"Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?  
Can the rushes *or* reed grass grow without water?  
###### 12
"While it is still green (in flower) and not cut down,  
Yet it withers before any *other* plant {when without water}.  
###### 13
"So are the paths of all who forget God;  
And the hope of the godless will perish,  
###### 14
For his confidence is fragile *and* breaks,  
And his trust is {like} a spider's web.  
###### 15
"He trusts in his house, but it does not stand;  
He holds tightly to it, but it does not endure.  
###### 16
"He thrives *and* prospers {like a green plant} before the sun,  
And his branches spread out over his garden.  
###### 17
"His {godless} roots are wrapped around a pile of rocks,  
And he gazes at a house of stones.  
###### 18
"If he is snatched from his place {in the garden},  
Then his place will forget him, *saying*, 'I have never seen you.'  
###### 19
"Behold, this is the joy of His way;  
And from out of the dust others will spring up *and* grow {to take his place}.  
###### 20
"Behold, God will not reject a *man of* integrity,  
Nor will He strengthen *or* support evildoers.  
###### 21
"He will yet fill your mouth with laughter  
And your lips with joyful shouting {if you are found blameless}.  
###### 22
"Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,  
And the tents of the wicked will be no longer."

## Elihu Claims to Speak for God
###### 1
"However, Job, please listen to my words,  
And pay attention to everything I say.  
###### 2
"Behold, I have opened my mouth {to begin my speech};  
My tongue in my mouth is going to speak.  
###### 3
"My words will express the uprightness of my heart,  
And my lips will speak what they know with utter sincerity.  
###### 4
"The Spirit of God has made me,  
And the breath of [^a]the Almighty gives me life {which inspires me}.  
###### 5
"Answer me, if you can;  
Set yourselves before me, take your stand.  
###### 6
"Behold, I belong to God like you;  
I too was formed out of the clay.  
###### 7
"Behold, I will not make you afraid or terrified of me {for I am only mortal and not God},  
Nor should any pressure from me weigh heavily upon you.
###### 8
"Surely you have spoken in my hearing,  
And I have heard the sound of your words, saying:  
###### 9
'I am pure, without transgression;  
I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.  
###### 10
'Behold, God finds pretexts against me;  
He counts me as His enemy.  
###### 11
'He puts my feet in the stocks {to hinder and humiliate me};  
He {suspiciously} watches all my paths,' {you say}.  
###### 12
"Look, let me answer you, in this you are not right *or* just;  
For God is greater *and* far superior to man.
###### 13
"Why do you complain against Him?  
That He does not answer {you with} all His doings.  
###### 14
"For God speaks once,  
And *even* twice, yet no one notices it {including you, Job}.  
###### 15
"In a dream, a vision of the night {one may hear God's voice},  
When deep sleep falls on men  
While slumbering upon the bed,  
###### 16
Then He opens the ears of men  
And seals their instruction,  
###### 17
That He may turn man aside *from his* conduct,  
And keep him from pride;  
###### 18
He holds back his soul from the pit {of destruction},  
And his life from passing over into Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead).
###### 19
"Man is also disciplined with pain on his bed,  
And with unceasing complaint in his bones,  
###### 20
So that his life makes him loathe food,  
And his soul {loathe} even his favorite dishes.  
###### 21
"His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen,  
And his bones which were not seen now stick out.  
###### 22
"Then his soul draws near to the pit {of destruction},  
And his life to those who bring death (the destroyers).
###### 23
"If there is an angel as a mediator for him,  
One out of a thousand,  
To explain to a man what is right for him {that is, how to be in right standing with God},  
###### 24
Then [^b]the angel is gracious to him, and says,  
'Spare him from going down to the pit {of destruction};  
I have found a ransom {a consideration, or reason for redemption, an atonement}!'  
###### 25
"Let his flesh be restored *and* become fresher than in youth;  
Let him return to the days of his youthful strength.  
###### 26
"He will pray to God, and He shall be favorable to him,  
So that he looks at His face with joy;  
For God restores to man His righteousness {that is, his right standing with God--with its joys}.  
###### 27
"He sings out to other men,  
'I have sinned and perverted that which was right,  
And it was not proper for me!  
###### 28
'God has redeemed my life from going to the pit {of destruction},  
And my life shall see the light.'"
###### 29
{Elihu comments,} "Behold, God does all these *things* [^c]twice, yes, three times, with a man,  
###### 30
To bring his life back from the pit {of destruction},  
That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.  
###### 31
"Pay attention, Job, listen to me;  
Keep silent, and I will speak.  
###### 32
"If you have anything to say, answer me;  
Speak, for I desire to justify you.  
###### 33
"If not {and you have nothing to say}, listen to me;  
Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom."

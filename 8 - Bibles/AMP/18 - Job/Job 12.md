## Job Chides His Accusers
###### 1
Then Job responded,
###### 2
"No doubt you are the {only wise} people {in the world},  
And wisdom will die with you!  
###### 3
"But I have intelligence *and* understanding as well as you;  
I am not inferior to you.  
Who does not know such things as these {of God's wisdom and might}?  
###### 4
"I am a joke to my friends;  
I, one whom God answered when he called upon Him--  
A just and blameless man is a joke {and laughed to scorn}.  
###### 5
"He who is at ease has contempt for misfortune,  
*But misfortune is* ready {and anxiously waiting} for those whose feet slip.  
###### 6
"The tents of the destroyers prosper;  
And those who provoke God are {apparently} secure,  
Whom God brings into their power.
###### 7
"Now ask the animals, and let them teach you {that God does not deal with His creatures according to their character};  
And ask the birds of the air, and let them tell you;  
###### 8
Or speak to the earth {with its many forms of life}, and it will teach you;  
And let the fish of the sea declare {this truth} to you.  
###### 9
"Who among all these does not recognize {in all these things that good and evil are randomly scattered throughout nature and human life}  
That the hand of the LORD has done this,  
###### 10
In whose hand is the life of every living thing,  
And the breath of all mankind?  
###### 11
"Does the ear not put words to the test,  
Just as the palate tastes its food {distinguishing between the desirable and the undesirable}?  
###### 12
"With the aged {you say} is wisdom,  
And *with* [^a]long life is understanding.

## Job Speaks of the Power of God
###### 13
"But {only} with Him are {perfect} wisdom and might;  
He {alone} has {true} counsel and understanding.  
###### 14
"Behold, He tears down, and it cannot be rebuilt;  
He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.  
###### 15
"Behold, He restrains the waters, and they dry up;  
Again, He sends the waters out, and they overwhelm *and* devastate the earth.  
###### 16
"With Him are might and sound wisdom,  
The misled and the misleader are His {and in His power}.  
###### 17
"He makes {great and scheming} counselors walk barefoot  
And makes fools of judges.  
###### 18
"He loosens the bond of kings  
And binds their loins with a loincloth.  
###### 19
"He makes priests walk barefoot,  
And He overturns men firmly seated *and* secure.  
###### 20
"He deprives the trusted ones of speech  
And takes away the discernment *and* discretion of the aged.  
###### 21
"He pours contempt on princes *and* nobles  
And loosens the belt of the strong {disabling them}.  
###### 22
"He uncovers mysteries {that are difficult to grasp and understand} out of the darkness  
And brings black gloom *and* the shadow of death into light.  
###### 23
"He makes nations great, and He destroys them;  
He enlarges nations, and leads them away {captive}.  
###### 24
"He removes intelligence *and* understanding from the leaders of the people of the earth  
And makes them wander *and* move blindly in a pathless waste.  
###### 25
"They grope in darkness without light,  
And He makes them stagger like a drunken man."

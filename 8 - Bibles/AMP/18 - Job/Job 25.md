## Bildad Says Man Is Inferior
###### 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
###### 2
"Dominion and awe belong to God;  
He establishes peace *and* order in His high places.  
###### 3
"Is there any number to His {vast celestial} armies?  
And upon whom does His light not rise?  
###### 4
"How then can man be justified *and* righteous with God?  
Or how can he who is born of a woman be pure *and* clean?  
###### 5
"Behold, even the moon has no brightness {compared to God's majesty and glory}  
And the stars are not pure in His sight,  
###### 6
How much less man, *that* maggot,  
And the son of man, *that* worm!"

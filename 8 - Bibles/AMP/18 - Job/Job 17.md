## Job Says He Has Become a Byword
###### 1
"My spirit is broken, my days are extinguished,  
The grave is *ready* for me.  
###### 2
"Surely there are mockers *and* mockery with me,  
And my eye gazes on their obstinacy *and* provocation.
###### 3
"Give me a pledge (guarantee, promise) with Yourself {acknowledge my innocence before my death};  
Who is there that will [^a]be my guarantor *and* give security for me?  
###### 4
"But You {Lord} have closed their hearts to understanding,  
Therefore You will not exalt them {by giving a verdict against me}.  
###### 5
"He who denounces *and* informs against his friends for a share *of the spoil*,  
The eyes of his children will also languish *and* fail.
###### 6
"But He has made me a byword *and* mockery among the people,  
And I have become one in whose face people spit.  
###### 7
"My eye has grown dim (unexpressive) because of grief,  
And all my {body's} members are {wasted away} like a shadow.  
###### 8
"The upright will be {astonished and} appalled at this,  
And the innocent will stir himself up against the godless *and* polluted.  
###### 9
"Nevertheless the righteous will hold to his ways,  
And he who has clean hands will grow stronger and stronger.  
###### 10
"But as for all of you, come back again,  
Even though I do not find a wise man among you.  
###### 11
"My days are past, my purposes *and* plans are frustrated *and* torn apart;  
The wishes of my heart {are broken}.  
###### 12
"These {thoughts try to} make the night into the day;  
'The light is near,' *they say* in the presence of darkness {but they pervert the truth}.  
###### 13
"But if I look to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) as my home,  
If I make my bed in the darkness,  
###### 14
If I call out to the pit (grave), 'You are my father';  
And to the worm {that feeds on decay}, 'You are my mother and my sister {because I will soon be closest to you},'  
###### 15
Where now is my hope?  
And who regards *or* considers *or* is even concerned about my hope?  
###### 16
"Will my hope go down with me to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead)?  
Shall we go down together in the dust?"

## Job Says Friends Are Sorry Comforters
###### 1
Then Job answered and said,
###### 2
"I have heard many such things;  
Wearisome *and* miserable comforters are you all.  
###### 3
"Is there no end to {your futile} words of wind?  
Or what plagues you {so much} that you {so boldly} answer {me like this}?  
###### 4
"I also could speak like you,  
If you were in my place;  
I could compose *and* join words together against you  
And shake my head at you.  
###### 5
"{But instead} I could strengthen *and* encourage you with {the words of} my mouth,  
And the consolation *and* solace of my lips would soothe your suffering *and* lessen your anguish.

## Job Says God Shattered Him
###### 6
"If I speak {to you miserable comforters}, my pain is not relieved;  
And if I refrain {from speaking}, what {pain or anguish} leaves me?  
###### 7
"But now God has exhausted me.  
You {O Lord} have destroyed all my family *and* my household.  
###### 8
"You have taken a firm hold on me *and* have shriveled me up,  
It has become a witness {against me};  
And my leanness {and infirmity} rises up {as evidence} against me,  
It testifies to my face {about my guilt}.  
###### 9
"His wrath has torn me and hunted me down,  
He has gnashed at me with his teeth;  
My adversary sharpens His gaze *and* glares {with piercing eyes} at me.  
###### 10
"They have gaped at me with their mouths,  
With contempt they have struck me on the cheek;  
They massed themselves together {and conspired} against me.  
###### 11
"God hands me over to [^a]criminals  
And tosses me {headlong} into the hands of the wicked.  
###### 12
"I was {living} at ease, but He crushed me *and* broke me apart,  
And He has seized me by the neck and has shaken me to pieces;  
He has also set me up as His target.  
###### 13
"His arrows surround me.  
He pierces my kidneys (vital organs) without mercy;  
He pours out my gall on the ground.  
###### 14
"He attacks me, making wound after wound;  
He runs at me like a warrior.  
###### 15
"I have sewed sackcloth over my skin {as a sign of mourning}  
And have defiled my horn (symbol of strength) in the dust.  
###### 16
"My face is red *and* swollen with weeping,  
And on my eyelids is the shadow of death {my eyes are dimmed},  
###### 17
Although there is no violence *or* wrongdoing in my hands,  
And my prayer is pure.
###### 18
"O earth, do not cover my blood,  
And let there be no {resting} place for my cry {where it will cease being heard}.  
###### 19
"Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,  
And my Advocate {who vouches and testifies for me} is on high.  
###### 20
"My friends are scoffers {who ridicule};  
My eye pours out tears to God.  
###### 21
"Oh, that a man would mediate *and* plead with God {for me}  
Just as a man {mediates and pleads} with his neighbor *and* friend.  
###### 22
"For when a few years are past,  
I shall go the way of no return.

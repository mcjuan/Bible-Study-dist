## Bildad Speaks of the Wicked
###### 1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,
###### 2
"How long will you hunt for words *and* continue these speeches?  
Do some clear thinking *and* show understanding and then we can talk.  
###### 3
"Why are we regarded as beasts,  
As if {we are} stupid (senseless) in your eyes?  
###### 4
"You who tear yourself apart in anger,  
Is the earth to be abandoned for your sake,  
Or the rock to be moved out of its place?
###### 5
"Indeed, the light of the wicked will be put out,  
And the flame of his fire will not shine.  
###### 6
"The light will be dark in his tent,  
And his lamp beside him will be put out.  
###### 7
"The vigorous stride will be shortened,  
And his own counsel *and* the scheme {in which he trusted} will bring his downfall.  
###### 8
"For the wicked is thrown into a net by his own feet (wickedness),  
And he steps on the webbing {of the lattice-covered pit}.  
###### 9
"A snare catches him by the heel,  
And a trap snaps shut on him.  
###### 10
"A noose is hidden for him on the ground,  
And a trap for him on the path.  
###### 11
"Terrors frighten him on every side  
And chase at his heels.  
###### 12
"The strength {of the wicked} is famished *and* weakened,  
And disaster is ready at his side {if he stops}.  
###### 13
"His skin is devoured by disease;  
The firstborn of death {the worst of diseases} consumes his limbs.  
###### 14
"He is torn from his tent which he trusted {for safety},  
And he is marched *and* brought to the king of terrors (death).  
###### 15
"Nothing of his dwells in his tent;  
Brimstone (burning sulfur) is scattered over his dwelling {to purify it}.  
###### 16
"The roots {of the wicked} are dried up below,  
And above, his branch is cut off *and* withers.  
###### 17
"Memory of him perishes from the earth,  
And he has no name on the street.  
###### 18
"He is driven *and* propelled from light into darkness,  
And chased from the inhabited world.  
###### 19
"He has no offspring or prosperity among his people,  
Nor any survivor where he sojourned.  
###### 20
"Those in the west are astonished *and* appalled at his fate,  
And those in the east are seized with horror.  
###### 21
"Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked *and* the ungodly,  
And such is the place of him who does not know *or* recognize *or* honor God."

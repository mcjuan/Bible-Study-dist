## Job Affirms His Righteousness
###### 1
Job continued his discourse and said,
###### 2
"As God lives, who has taken away my right *and* denied me justice,  
And the Almighty, who has caused bitterness *and* grief for my soul,  
###### 3
As long as my life is within me,  
And the breath of God is {still} in my nostrils,  
###### 4
My lips will not speak unjustly,  
Nor will my tongue utter deceit.  
###### 5
"Far be it from me that I should admit you are right {in your accusations against me};  
Until I die, I will not remove my integrity from me.  
###### 6
"I hold fast my uprightness *and* my right standing with God and I will not let them go;  
My heart does not reproach me for any of my days.

## The State of the Godless
###### 7
"May my enemy be as the wicked,  
And he who rises up against me be as the unrighteous (unjust).  
###### 8
"For what is the hope of the godless, even though he has gained {in this world},  
When God takes his life?  
###### 9
"Will God hear his cry  
When trouble *and* distress come upon him?  
###### 10
"Will he take delight in the Almighty?  
Will he call on God at all times?  
###### 11
"I will teach you regarding the hand (power) of God;  
I will not conceal what is with the Almighty {God's actual treatment of the wicked}.  
###### 12
"Behold, all of you have seen it;  
Why then do you act vainly *and* foolishly {cherishing worthless concepts}?
###### 13
"This {which I am about to explain} is the portion of a wicked man from God,  
And the inheritance which tyrants *and* oppressors receive from the Almighty:  
###### 14
"Though his children are many, they are destined for the sword;  
And his descendants will not have sufficient bread.  
###### 15
"Those who survive him will be buried because of the plague,  
And {their} widows will not be able to weep.  
###### 16
"Though he heaps up silver like dust  
And piles up clothing like clay,  
###### 17
He may prepare it, but the just will wear it  
And the innocent will divide the silver.  
###### 18
"He builds his house like a spider's web,  
Like a (temporary) hut which a watchman makes.  
###### 19
"He lies down rich, but never will again;  
He opens his eyes, and it is gone.  
###### 20
"Terrors overtake him like a {suddenly rising} flood;  
A windstorm steals him away in the night.  
###### 21
"The east wind lifts him up, and he is gone;  
It sweeps him out of his place.  
###### 22
"For it will hurl {thunderbolts of God's wrath} at him unsparingly *and* without compassion;  
He flees in haste from its power.  
###### 23
"People will clap their hands at him {to mock and ridicule him}  
And hiss him out of his place.

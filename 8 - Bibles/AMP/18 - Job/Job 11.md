## Zophar Rebukes Job
###### 1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,
###### 2
"Shall a multitude of words not be answered?  
And should a talkative man {making such a long-winded defense} be acquitted?  
###### 3
"Should your boasts *and* babble silence men?  
And shall you scoff and no one put you to shame?  
###### 4
"For you have said, 'My teaching (doctrine) {that God knowingly afflicts the righteous} is pure,  
And I am innocent in your eyes.'  
###### 5
"But oh, that God would speak,  
And open His lips {to speak} against you,  
###### 6
And {that He would} show you the secrets of wisdom!  
For sound wisdom [^a]has two sides.  
Know therefore that God forgets a part of your wickedness *and* guilt.
###### 7
"Can you discover the depths of God?  
Can you {by searching} discover the limits of the Almighty {ascend to His heights, extend to His widths, and comprehend His infinite perfection}?  
###### 8
"*His wisdom* is as high as the heights of heaven. What can you do?  
It is deeper than Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). What can you know?  
###### 9
"It is longer in measure {and scope} than the earth,  
And broader than the sea.  
###### 10
"If God passes by or arrests,  
Or calls an assembly {of judgment}, who can restrain Him?  
{If He is against a man, who can call Him to account for it?}  
###### 11
"For He recognizes *and* knows false *and* worthless men,  
And He sees wickedness, will He not consider it?  
###### 12
"But a hollow (empty-headed) man will become intelligent *and* wise  
{Only} when the [^b]colt of a wild donkey is born as a man.
###### 13
"If you direct your heart {on the right path}  
And stretch out your hands to Him,  
###### 14
If sin is in your hand, put it far away {from you},  
And do not let wrongdoing dwell in your tents;  
###### 15
Then, indeed, you could lift up your face {to Him} without *moral* defect,  
And you would be firmly established *and* secure and not fear.  
###### 16
"For you would forget your trouble;  
You would remember it as waters that have passed by.  
###### 17
"And your [^c]life would be brighter than the noonday;  
Darkness {then} would be like the morning.  
###### 18
"Then you would trust {with confidence}, because there is hope;  
You would look around you and rest securely.  
###### 19
"You would lie down with no one to frighten you,  
And many would entreat *and* seek your favor.  
###### 20
"But the eyes of the wicked will fail,  
And they will not escape {the justice of God};  
And their hope is to breathe their last {and die}."

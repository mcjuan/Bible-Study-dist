## Job Says He Longs for God
###### 1
Then Job answered and said,
###### 2
"Even today my complaint is contentious;  
His hand is heavy despite my groaning.  
###### 3
"Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,  
That I might {even} come to His seat!  
###### 4
"I would present my cause before Him  
And fill my mouth with arguments.  
###### 5
"I would learn the words which He would answer,  
And understand what He would say to me.  
###### 6
"Would He contend against me with His great power?  
No, surely He would give attention to me.  
###### 7
"There the righteous and upright could reason with Him;  
So I would be acquitted forever by my Judge.
###### 8
"Behold, I go forward (to the east), but He is not there;  
I go backward (to the west), but I cannot perceive Him;  
###### 9
To the left (north) He turns, but I cannot behold Him;  
He turns to the right hand (south), but I cannot see Him.  
###### 10
"But He knows the way that I take {and He pays attention to it}.  
*When* He has tried me, I will come forth as {refined} gold {pure and luminous}.  
###### 11
"My feet have carefully followed His steps;  
I have kept His ways and not turned aside.  
###### 12
"I have not departed from the commandment of His lips;  
I have kept the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.  
###### 13
"But He is unique *and* unchangeable, and who can turn Him?  
And *what* His soul desires, that He does.  
###### 14
"For He performs what is planned (appointed) for me,  
And He is mindful of many such things.  
###### 15
"Therefore I would be terrified at His presence;  
*When* I consider {all of this}, I tremble in dread of Him.  
###### 16
"For God has made my heart faint,  
And the Almighty has terrified me,  
###### 17
But I am not silenced by the darkness {of these woes that fell on me},  
Nor by the thick darkness which covers my face.

## Job's Present State Is Humiliating
###### 1
"But now those younger than I mock *and* laugh at me,  
Whose fathers I refused to put with the sheepdogs of my flock.  
###### 2
"Indeed, how could the strength of their hands profit me?  
Vigor had perished from them.  
###### 3
"They are gaunt with want and famine;  
They gnaw the dry *and* barren ground by night in {the gloom of} waste and desolation.  
###### 4
"They pluck {and eat} [^a]saltwort (mallows) among the bushes,  
And their food is the root of the broom shrub.  
###### 5
"They are driven from the community;  
They shout after them as after a thief.  
###### 6
"They must dwell on the slopes of [^b]wadis  
*And in* holes in the ground and in rocks.  
###### 7
"Among the bushes they cry out {like wild animals};  
Beneath the prickly scrub they gather *and* huddle together.  
###### 8
"*They are the* sons of {worthless and nameless} fools,  
They have been driven out of the land.
###### 9
"And now I have become {the subject of} their taunting;  
Yes, I am a [^c]byword *and* a laughingstock to them.  
###### 10
"They hate me, they stand aloof from me,  
And do not refrain from spitting in my face.  
###### 11
"For God has loosed His bowstring {attacking me} and {He has} afflicted *and* humbled me;  
They have cast off the bridle {of restraint} before me.  
###### 12
"On my right the {rabble} brood rises;  
They push my feet away, and they build up their ways of destruction against me {like an advancing army}.  
###### 13
"They break up *and* clutter my path {upsetting my plans},  
They profit from my destruction;  
No one restrains them.  
###### 14
"As *through* a wide breach they come,  
Amid the crash {of falling walls} they roll on {over me}.  
###### 15
"Terrors are turned upon me;  
They chase away my honor *and* reputation like the wind,  
And my prosperity has passed away like a cloud.
###### 16
"And now my soul is poured out within me;  
The days of affliction have seized me.  
###### 17
"My bones are pierced {with aching} in the night season,  
And *the pains* that gnaw me take no rest.  
###### 18
"By the great force {of my disease} my garment (skin) is disfigured *and* blemished;  
It binds about me {choking me} like the collar of my coat.  
###### 19
"God has cast me into the mire {a swampland of crisis},  
And I have become {worthless} like dust and ashes.  
###### 20
"I cry to You for help, {Lord,} but You do not answer me;  
I stand up, but You {only} gaze {indifferently} at me.  
###### 21
"You have become harsh *and* cruel to me;  
With the might of Your hand You {keep me alive only to} persecute me.  
###### 22
"You lift me up on the wind and cause me to ride {upon it};  
And You toss me about in the tempest *and* dissolve me in the storm.  
###### 23
"For I know that You will bring me to death  
And to the house of meeting {appointed} for all the living.
###### 24
"However, does not one falling in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand?  
Or in his disaster {will he not} therefore cry out for help?  
###### 25
"Did I not weep for one whose life was hard *and* filled with trouble?  
Was not my heart grieved for the needy?  
###### 26
"When I expected good, then came evil {to me};  
And when I waited for light, then came darkness.  
###### 27
"I am seething within *and* my heart is troubled and cannot rest;  
Days of affliction come to meet me.  
###### 28
"I go about mourning without comfort {my skin blackened by disease, not by the heat of the sun};  
I stand up in the assembly *and* cry out for help.  
###### 29
"I am a brother to {howling} jackals,  
And a companion to ostriches {which scream dismally}.  
###### 30
"My skin falls from me in blackened flakes,  
And my bones are burned with fever.  
###### 31
"Therefore my lyre (harp) is *used* for {the sound of} mourning,  
And my flute for the {sound of the} voices of those who weep.

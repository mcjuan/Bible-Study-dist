## Job's Life Seems Futile
###### 1
"Is not man forced to labor on earth?  
And are not his days like the days of a hired man?  
###### 2
"As a slave earnestly longs for the shade,  
And as a hired man eagerly awaits his wages,  
###### 3
So am I allotted months of futility *and* suffering,  
And {long} nights of trouble *and* misery are appointed to me.  
###### 4
"When I lie down I say,  
'When shall I arise {and the night be gone}?'  
But the night continues,  
And I am continually tossing until the dawning of day.  
###### 5
"My body is clothed with worms and a crust of dust;  
My skin is hardened {and broken and loathsome}, and {breaks out and} runs.  
###### 6
"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,  
And are spent without hope.
###### 7
"Remember that my life is but breath {a puff of wind, a sigh};  
My eye will not see good again.  
###### 8
"The eye of him who sees me {now} will see me no more;  
Your eyes *will be* upon me, but I will not be.  
###### 9
"As a cloud vanishes and is gone,  
So he who goes down to Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) does not come up.  
###### 10
"He will not return again to his house,  
Nor will his place know about him anymore.
###### 11
"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;  
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit,  
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul {O Lord}.  
###### 12
"Am I the sea, or the sea monster,  
That You set a guard over me?  
###### 13
"When I say, 'My bed will comfort me,  
My couch will ease my complaint,'  
###### 14
Then You frighten me with dreams  
And terrify me through visions,  
###### 15
So that I would choose suffocation,  
Death rather than my [^a]pain.  
###### 16
"I waste away *and* loathe my life; I will not live forever.  
Let me alone, for my days are but a breath {futile and without substance}.  
###### 17
"What is man that You {should} magnify him {and think him important}?  
And that You are concerned about him?  
###### 18
"And that You examine him every morning  
And try *and* test him every moment?  
###### 19
"Will You never turn Your gaze away from me {it plagues me},  
Nor let me alone until I swallow my spittle?  
###### 20
"If I have sinned, what {harm} have I done to You,  
O Watcher of mankind?  
Why have You set me as a target for You,  
So that I am a burden to myself?  
###### 21
"Why then do You not pardon my transgression  
And take away my sin *and* guilt?  
For now I will lie down in the dust;  
And You will seek me {diligently}, but I will not be."

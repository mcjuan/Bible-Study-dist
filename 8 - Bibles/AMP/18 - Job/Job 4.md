## Eliphaz: Innocent Do Not Suffer
###### 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
###### 2
"If we dare to converse with you, will you be impatient {or offended}?  
But who can restrain himself from speaking?  
###### 3
"Behold, you have admonished *and* instructed many,  
And you have strengthened weak hands.  
###### 4
"Your words have helped the one who was stumbling to stand,  
And you have strengthened feeble knees.  
###### 5
"But now [^a]adversity comes upon you, and you are impatient *and* intolerant;  
It touches you, and you are horrified.  
###### 6
"Is not your fear *of God* your confidence,  
And {is not} the integrity *and* uprightness of your ways your hope?
###### 7
"Remember now, who, being innocent, ever perished?  
Or where {and in what circumstances} were those upright *and* in right standing with God destroyed?  
###### 8
"As I have seen, those who plow wickedness  
And those who sow trouble *and* harm harvest it.  
###### 9
"By the breath of God they perish,  
And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.  
###### 10
"The roaring of the lion and the voice of the *fierce* lion,  
And the teeth of the young lions are broken.  
###### 11
"The lion perishes for lack of prey,  
And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
###### 12
"Now a word was secretly brought to me,  
And my ear received a whisper of it.  
###### 13
"Amid disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,  
When deep sleep falls on men,  
###### 14
Dread and trembling came upon me,  
Which made all my bones shake.  
###### 15
"Then a spirit passed before my face;  
The hair on my skin stood on end!  
###### 16
"The spirit stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;  
A form was before my eyes;  
*There was* silence, and then I heard a voice, saying:  
###### 17
'Can {mortal} man be just before God *or* be more righteous than He?  
Can a man be pure before his Maker *or* be more cleansed than He?  
###### 18
'God puts no trust *or* confidence, even in His {heavenly} servants,  
And He charges His angels with error.  
###### 19
'How much more {will He blame and charge} those who dwell in houses (bodies) of clay,  
Whose foundations are in the dust,  
Who are crushed like a moth.  
###### 20
'Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces *and* destroyed;  
Unobserved *and* unnoticed, they perish forever.  
###### 21
'Is not their tent-cord drawn up within them {so that the tent collapses}?  
Do they not die, and yet without {acquiring} wisdom?'

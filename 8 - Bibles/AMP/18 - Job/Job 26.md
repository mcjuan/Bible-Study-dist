## Job Rebukes Bildad
###### 1
But Job answered and said,
###### 2
"What a help you are to the weak (powerless)!  
How you have saved the arm that is without strength!  
###### 3
"How you have counseled the one who has no wisdom!  
And how abundantly you have provided sound wisdom *and* helpful insight!  
###### 4
"To whom have you uttered {these} words?  
And whose spirit {inspired what} came forth from you?

## The Greatness of God
###### 5
"The spirits of the dead tremble  
Underneath the waters and their inhabitants.  
###### 6
"Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) is naked before God,  
And Abaddon (the place of destruction) has no covering {from His eyes}.  
###### 7
"*It is* He *who* spreads out the north over emptiness  
And [^a]hangs the earth on nothing.  
###### 8
"He wraps the waters in His clouds {which otherwise would spill on earth all at once},  
And the cloud does not burst under them.  
###### 9
"He covers the face of the [^b]full moon  
And spreads His cloud over it.  
###### 10
"He has inscribed a circular limit (the horizon) on the face of the waters  
At the boundary between light and darkness.  
###### 11
"The pillars of the heavens tremble  
And are terrified at His rebuke.  
###### 12
"He stirred up the sea by His power,  
And by His understanding He smashed {proud} [^c]Rahab.  
###### 13
"By His breath the heavens are cleared;  
His hand has pierced the {swiftly} fleeing serpent.  
###### 14
"Yet these are just the fringes of His ways {mere samples of His power},  
The faintest whisper of His voice!  
Who can contemplate the thunder of His {full} mighty power?"

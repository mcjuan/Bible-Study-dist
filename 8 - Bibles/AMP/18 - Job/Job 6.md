## Job's Friends Are No Help
###### 1
Then Job answered and said,
###### 2
"Oh, that my grief could actually be weighed  
And placed in the balances together with my tragedy {to see if my grief is the grief of a coward}!  
###### 3
"For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea;  
Therefore my words have been incoherent,  
###### 4
Because the arrows of the Almighty are within me,  
My spirit drinks their poison;  
The terrors of God are arrayed against me.  
###### 5
"Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?  
Or does the ox low over his fodder?  
###### 6
"Can something that has no taste to it be eaten without salt?  
Or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?  
###### 7
"My soul refuses to touch them;  
Such things are like loathsome food to me {sickening and repugnant}.
###### 8
"Oh that my request would come to pass,  
And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!  
###### 9
"I wish that it would please God to crush me,  
That He would let loose His hand and cut me off.  
###### 10
"Then I would still have consolation,  
And I would jump for joy amid unsparing pain,  
That I have not denied *or* hidden the words of the Holy One.  
###### 11
"What strength do I have left, that I should wait {and hope}?  
And what is ahead of me, that I should be patient *and* endure?  
###### 12
"Is my strength *and* endurance that of stones,  
Or is my flesh made of bronze?  
###### 13
"Is it that I have no help within myself,  
And that success *and* wisdom have been driven from me?
###### 14
"For the despairing man *there should be* kindness from his friend;  
So that he does not [^a]abandon (turn away from) the fear of the Almighty.  
###### 15
"My brothers have acted deceitfully like a brook,  
Like the torrents of brooks that vanish,  
###### 16
Which are dull *and* dirty because of ice,  
And into which the snow melts *and* hides itself;  
###### 17
When it is warm, they are silent *and* cease to flow;  
When it is hot, they vanish from their place.  
###### 18
"The paths of their course wind along,  
They go up into nothing *and* perish.  
{Your counsel is as helpful to me as a dry streambed in the heat of summer.}  
###### 19
"The caravans of [^b]Tema looked {for water},  
The caravans of [^c]Sheba waited for them {in vain}.  
###### 20
"They were put to shame *and* disappointed because they had trusted {that they would find water};  
They came there and were ashamed.  
###### 21
"Indeed, you have now become like a dried-up stream,  
You see a terror {believing me to be a victim of the wrath of God} and are afraid {to be compassionate}.  
###### 22
"Did I ever say, 'Give me *something*,'  
Or, 'Pay a bribe for me from your wealth,'  
###### 23
Or, 'Rescue me from the adversary's hand,'  
Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the tyrants'?
###### 24
"Teach me, and I will be silent;  
And show me how I have erred.  
###### 25
"How painful are words of honesty.  
But what does your argument prove?  
###### 26
"Do you intend to reprove my words {with a convincing argument},  
When the words of one in despair belong to the wind {and go ignored}?  
###### 27
"You would cast *lots* (gamble) over the fatherless  
And bargain away your friend.  
###### 28
"Now please look at me,  
And *see* if I lie to your face {for you know that I would not}.  
###### 29
"Turn away {from your suspicion}, let there be no injustice;  
Turn away, my righteousness *and* vindication is still in it.  
###### 30
"Is there injustice *or* malice on my tongue?  
Can my palate not discern what is destructive?

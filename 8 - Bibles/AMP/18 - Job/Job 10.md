## Job Despairs of God's Dealings
###### 1
"I am disgusted with my life *and* loathe it!  
I will give free expression to my complaint;  
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.  
###### 2
"I will say to God, 'Do not condemn me {and declare me guilty}!  
Show me why You contend *and* argue *and* struggle with me.  
###### 3
'Does it indeed seem right to You to oppress,  
To despise *and* reject the work of Your hands,  
And to look with favor on the schemes of the wicked?  
###### 4
'Do You have eyes of flesh?  
Do You see as a man sees?  
###### 5
'Are Your days as the days of a mortal,  
Are Your years as man's years,  
###### 6
That You seek my guilt  
And search for my sin?  
###### 7
'Although You know that I am not guilty *or* wicked,  
Yet there is no one who can rescue me from Your hand.
###### 8
'Your hands have formed and made me altogether.  
Would You {turn around and} destroy me?  
###### 9
'Remember now, that You have made me as clay;  
So will You turn me into dust again?  
###### 10
'Have You not poured me out like milk  
And curdled me like cheese?  
###### 11
'{You have} clothed me with skin and flesh,  
And knit me together with bones and sinews.  
###### 12
'You have granted me life and lovingkindness;  
And Your providence (divine care, supervision) has preserved my spirit.  
###### 13
'Yet these {present evils} You have hidden in Your heart {since my creation}:  
I know that this was within You {in Your purpose and thought}.  
###### 14
'If I sin, then You would take note *and* observe me,  
And You would not acquit me of my guilt.  
###### 15
'If I am wicked, woe to me {for judgment comes}!  
And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head.  
For I am sated *and* filled with disgrace and the sight of my misery.  
###### 16
'Should I lift my head up, You would hunt me like a lion;  
And again You would show Your marvelous power against me.  
###### 17
'You renew Your witnesses against me  
And increase Your indignation *and* anger toward me;  
Hardship after hardship is with me {attacking me time after time}.
###### 18
'Why then did You bring me out of the womb?  
Would that I had perished and no eye had seen me!  
###### 19
'I should have been as though I had not existed;  
{I should have been} carried from the womb to the grave.'  
###### 20
"Would He not let my few days alone,  
Withdraw from me that I may have a little cheer  
###### 21
Before I go--and I shall not return--  
To the land of darkness and the deep shadow {of death},  
###### 22
The {sunless} land of utter gloom as darkness *itself*,  
{The land} of the shadow of death, without order,  
And {where} it shines as {thick} darkness."

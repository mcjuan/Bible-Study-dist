## Eliphaz Accuses and Exhorts Job
###### 1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
###### 2
"Can a vigorous man be of use to God,  
Or a wise man be useful to himself?  
###### 3
"Is it any pleasure *or* joy to [^a]the Almighty that you are righteous?  
Or is it of benefit to Him that you make your ways perfect?  
###### 4
"Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you,  
That He enters into judgment against you?  
###### 5
"Is not your wickedness great,  
And your sins without end?  
###### 6
"For you have taken pledges of your brothers without cause,  
And stripped men naked.  
###### 7
"You have not given water to the weary to drink,  
And you have withheld bread from the hungry.  
###### 8
"But the land is possessed by the man with power,  
And the favored *and* honorable man dwells in it.  
###### 9
"You have sent widows away empty-handed,  
And the arms (strength) of the fatherless have been broken.  
###### 10
"Therefore snares surround you,  
And sudden dread terrifies *and* overwhelms you;  
###### 11
Or darkness, so that you cannot see,  
And a flood of water covers you.
###### 12
"Is not God in the height of heaven?  
And behold the distant stars, how high they are!  
###### 13
"You say, 'What does God know {about me}?  
Can He judge through the thick darkness?  
###### 14
'Thick clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see,  
And He walks on the vault (circle) of the heavens.'  
###### 15
"Will you keep to the ancient path  
That wicked men walked {in the time of Noah},  
###### 16
Men who were snatched away before their time,  
Whose foundations were poured out like a river?  
###### 17
"They said to God, 'Depart from us!  
What can the Almighty do for us *or* to us?'  
###### 18
"Yet He filled their houses with good *things*;  
But the counsel of the wicked *and* ungodly is far from me.  
###### 19
"The righteous see it and are glad;  
And the innocent mock *and* laugh at them, *saying*,  
###### 20
'Surely our adversaries are cut off *and* destroyed,  
And fire has consumed their abundance.'
###### 21
"Now yield *and* submit yourself to Him {agree with God and be conformed to His will} and be at peace;  
In this way {you will prosper and great} good will come to you.  
###### 22
"Please receive the law *and* instruction from His mouth  
And establish His words in your heart *and* keep them.  
###### 23
"If you return to the Almighty {and submit and humble yourself before Him}, you will be built up {and restored};  
*If* you remove unrighteousness far from your tents,  
###### 24
And place your gold in the dust,  
And *the gold of* Ophir among the stones of the brooks {considering it of little value},  
###### 25
And make the Almighty your gold  
And your precious silver,  
###### 26
Then you will have delight in the Almighty,  
And you will lift up your face to God.  
###### 27
"You will pray to Him, and He will hear you,  
And you will pay your vows.  
###### 28
"You will also decide *and* decree a thing, and it will be established for you;  
And the light {of God's favor} will shine upon your ways.  
###### 29
"When you are cast down *and* humbled, you will speak with confidence,  
And the humble person He will lift up *and* save.  
###### 30
"He will even rescue the one {for whom you intercede} who is not innocent;  
And he will be rescued through the cleanness of your hands."

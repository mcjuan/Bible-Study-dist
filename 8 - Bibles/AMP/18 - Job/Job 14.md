## Job Speaks of the Finality of Death
###### 1
"Man, who is born of a woman,  
Is short-lived and full of turmoil.  
###### 2
"Like a flower he comes forth and withers;  
He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.  
###### 3
"You also open Your eyes upon him  
And bring him into judgment with Yourself.  
###### 4
"Who can make a clean thing out of the unclean?  
No one!  
###### 5
"Since his days are determined,  
The number of his months is with You {in Your control},  
And You have made his limits so he cannot pass {his allotted time}.  
###### 6
"{O God} turn your gaze from him so that he may rest,  
Until he fulfills his day {on earth} like a hired man.
###### 7
"For there is hope for a tree,  
If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,  
And that the shoots of it will not cease *nor* fail, {but there is no such hope for man}.  
###### 8
"Though its roots grow old in the earth  
And its stump dies in the dry soil,  
###### 9
Yet at the scent of water {the stump of the tree} will flourish  
And bring forth sprigs *and* shoots like a seedling.  
###### 10
"But {the brave, strong} man must die and lie face down;  
Man breathes his last, and where is he?  
###### 11
"As water evaporates from the sea,  
And a river drains and dries up,  
###### 12
So man lies down and does not rise {again}.  
Until the heavens are no longer,  
*The dead* will not awake nor be raised from their sleep.
###### 13
"Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead),  
That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,  
That You would set a definite time and then remember me {and in Your lovingkindness imprint me on your heart}!  
###### 14
"If a man dies, will he live again?  
I will wait all the days of my struggle  
Until my change *and* release will come.  
###### 15
"{Then} You will call, and I will answer You;  
You will long for {me} the work of Your hands.  
###### 16
"But now You number {each of} my steps;  
You do not observe *nor* take note of my sin.  
###### 17
"My transgression is sealed up in a bag,  
And You cover my wickedness {from Your view}.
###### 18
"But as a mountain, if it falls, crumbles into nothing,  
And as the rock is moved from its place,  
###### 19
Water wears away the stones,  
Its floods *and* torrents wash away the soil of the earth,  
So You {O Lord} destroy the hope of man.  
###### 20
"You prevail forever against him *and* overpower him, and he passes on;  
You change his appearance and send him away {from the presence of the living}.  
###### 21
"His sons achieve honor, and he does not know it;  
They become insignificant, and he is not aware of it.  
###### 22
"But his body {lamenting its decay} grieves in pain over it,  
And his soul mourns over {the loss of} himself."

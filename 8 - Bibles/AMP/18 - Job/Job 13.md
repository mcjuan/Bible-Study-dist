## Job Says His Friends' Proverbs Are Ashes
###### 1
{Job continued:} "Behold, my eye has seen all *this*,  
My ear has heard and understood it.  
###### 2
"What you know I also know;  
I am not inferior to you.
###### 3
"But I wish to speak to [^a]the Almighty,  
And I desire to argue with God.  
###### 4
"But you smear me with lies {you defame my character most untruthfully};  
You are all worthless physicians *and* have no remedy to offer.  
###### 5
"Oh, that you would be completely silent,  
And that *silence* would be your wisdom!  
###### 6
"Please hear my argument  
And listen to the pleadings of my lips.  
###### 7
"Will you speak what is unjust for God,  
And speak what is deceitful for Him?  
###### 8
"Will you show partiality for Him {and be unjust to me so that you may gain favor with Him}?  
Will you contend *and* plead for God?  
###### 9
"Will it be well for you when He investigates you {and your tactics against me}?  
Or will you deceive Him as one deceives a man?  
###### 10
"He will surely reprimand you  
If you secretly show partiality.  
###### 11
"Will not His majesty terrify you,  
And will not the dread of Him fall upon you?  
###### 12
"Your memorable sayings are {worthless, merely} proverbs of ashes;  
Your defenses are defenses of {crumbling} clay.

## Job Is Sure He Will Be Vindicated
###### 13
"Be silent before me so that I may speak;  
And let happen to me what may.  
###### 14
"Why should I take my flesh in my teeth  
And put my life in my hands {incurring the wrath of God}?  
###### 15
"Even though He kills me;  
I will hope in Him.  
Nevertheless, I will argue my ways to His face.  
###### 16
"This also will be my salvation,  
For a godless man may not come before Him.  
###### 17
"Listen diligently to my speech,  
And let my declaration fill your ears.  
###### 18
"Behold now, I have prepared my case;  
I know that I will be vindicated.  
###### 19
"Who will argue *and* contend with me?  
For then I would be silent and die.
###### 20
"Only {O Lord,} do not do two things to me,  
And then I will not hide myself from Your face:  
###### 21
Withdraw Your hand from me *and* remove this bodily suffering,  
And let not the dread of You terrify me.  
###### 22
"Then {Lord,} call, and I will answer;  
Or let me speak, and then reply to me.  
###### 23
"How many are my iniquities and sins {that so much sorrow should come to me}?  
Make me recognize *and* understand my transgression and my sin.  
###### 24
"Why do You hide Your face {as if offended}  
And consider me Your enemy?  
###### 25
"Will You cause a windblown leaf to tremble?  
Will You pursue the chaff of the dry stubble?  
###### 26
"For You write bitter things against me {in Your indictment}  
And make me inherit *and* suffer for the iniquities of my youth.  
###### 27
"You also put my feet in the stocks {as punishment}  
And {critically} observe all my paths;  
You set a circle *and* limit around the soles of my feet {which I must not overstep},  
###### 28
While I waste away like a rotten thing,  
Like a garment that is moth-eaten.

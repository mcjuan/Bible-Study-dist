## Elihu Sharply Reproves Job
###### 1
Elihu continued speaking {to Job} and said,
###### 2
"Do you think this is according to {your} justice?  
Do you say, 'My righteousness is more than God's'?  
###### 3
"For you say, 'What advantage have you {by living a righteous life}?  
What profit will I have, more {by being righteous} than if I had sinned?'  
###### 4
"I will answer you,  
And your companions with you.  
###### 5
"Look to the heavens and see;  
And behold the skies which are {much} higher than you.  
###### 6
"If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him?  
And if your transgressions are multiplied, what have you done to Him?  
###### 7
"If you are righteous, what do you give God,  
Or what does He receive from your hand?  
###### 8
"Your wickedness *affects only* a man such as you,  
And your righteousness *affects only* [^a]a son of man {but it cannot affect God, who is sovereign}.
###### 9
"Because of the multitudes of oppressions *the people* cry out;  
They cry for help because of the {violent} arm of the mighty.  
###### 10
"But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker,  
Who gives songs {of rejoicing} in the night,  
###### 11
Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth  
And makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?'  
###### 12
"The people cry out, but He does not answer  
Because of the pride of evil men.  
###### 13
"Surely God will not listen to an empty cry {which lacks trust},  
Nor will the Almighty regard it.  
###### 14
"Even though you say that you do not see Him {when missing His righteous judgment on earth},  
Yet your case is before Him, and you must wait for Him!  
###### 15
"And now, because He has not {quickly} punished in His anger,  
Nor has He acknowledged transgression *and* arrogance well {and seems unaware of the wrong of which a person is guilty},  
###### 16
Job uselessly opens his mouth  
And multiplies words without knowledge {drawing the worthless conclusion that the righteous have no more advantage than the wicked}."

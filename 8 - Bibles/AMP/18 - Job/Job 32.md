## Elihu Rebukes Job
###### 1
So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes {and could not be persuaded otherwise by them}.  
###### 2
But Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became indignant. His indignation was kindled *and* burned *and* he became upset with Job because he justified himself rather than God {and even expressed doubts about God's character}.  
###### 3
Elihu's anger burned against Job's three friends because they had found no answer {and were unable to determine Job's error}, and yet they had condemned Job *and* declared him to be in the wrong {and responsible for his own afflictions}.  
###### 4
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were years older than he.  
###### 5
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouths of these three men, he burned with anger.
###### 6
Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite said,
"I am young, and you are aged;  
For that reason I was anxious and dared not tell you what I think.  
###### 7
"I thought age should speak,  
And a multitude of years should teach wisdom.  
###### 8
"But there is {a vital force and} a spirit {of intelligence} in man,  
And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.  
###### 9
"Those {who are} abundant *in years* may not {always} be wise,  
Nor may the elders {always} understand justice.  
###### 10
"Therefore I say, 'Listen to me;  
I also will give you my opinion {about Job's situation} *and* tell you plainly what I think.'
###### 11
"You see, I waited for your words,  
I listened to your {wise} reasons,  
While you pondered *and* searched out what to say.  
###### 12
"I even paid close attention to {what} you {said},  
Indeed, not one of you convinced Job {nor could you refute him},  
Not one of you supplied {satisfactory} answers to his words.  
###### 13
"Beware if you say,  
'We have found wisdom;  
God thrusts Job down {justly}, not man {for God alone is dealing with him}.'  
###### 14
"Now Job has not directed his words against me {therefore I have no reason to be offended},  
Nor will I answer him with arguments like yours. {I speak for truth, not for revenge.}
###### 15
"They (Job's friends) are dismayed *and* embarrassed, they no longer answer;  
The words have moved away *and* failed them," {says Elihu}.  
###### 16
"And shall I wait, because they say nothing,  
But stand still and say no more?  
###### 17
"I too will give my share of answers;  
I too will express my opinion *and* share my knowledge.  
###### 18
"For I am full of words;  
The spirit within me constrains me.  
###### 19
"My belly is like unvented wine;  
Like new wineskins it is about to burst.  
###### 20
"I must speak so that I may get relief;  
I will open my lips and answer.  
###### 21
"I will not {I warn you} be partial to any man {that is, let my respect for you mitigate what I say};  
Nor flatter any man.  
###### 22
"For I do not know how to flatter, {in an appropriate way, and I fear that},  
My Maker would soon take me away.

## Growth in Christian Virtue
###### 1
Simon[^a] Peter, a bond-servant and apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ,
To those who have [^b]received *and* possess {by God's will} a precious faith of the [^c]same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ:  
###### 2
Grace and peace {that special sense of spiritual well-being} be multiplied to you in the {true, intimate} knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.  
###### 3
For His divine power has bestowed on us {absolutely} everything necessary for {a dynamic spiritual} life and godliness, through [^d]true *and* personal knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.  
###### 4
For by these He has bestowed on us His precious and magnificent promises {of inexpressible value}, so that by them you may escape from the immoral freedom that is in the world because of disreputable desire, and become sharers of the divine nature.  
###### 5
For this very reason, applying your diligence {to the divine promises, make every effort} in {exercising} your faith to, [^e]develop moral excellence, and in moral excellence, knowledge (insight, understanding),  
###### 6
and in *your* knowledge, self-control, and in *your* self-control, steadfastness, and in *your* steadfastness, godliness,  
###### 7
and in *your* godliness, brotherly affection, and in *your* brotherly affection, {develop Christian} love {that is, learn to unselfishly seek the best for others and to do things for their benefit}.  
###### 8
For as these *qualities* are yours and are increasing {in you as you grow toward spiritual maturity}, they will keep you from being useless and unproductive in regard to the true knowledge *and* greater understanding of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
###### 9
For whoever lacks these *qualities* is blind--shortsighted {closing his spiritual eyes to the truth}, having become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sins.  
###### 10
Therefore, believers, be all the more diligent to make certain about His calling and choosing you {be sure that your behavior reflects and confirms your relationship with God}; for by [^f]doing these things {actively developing these virtues}, you will never stumble {in your spiritual growth and will live a life that leads others away from sin};  
###### 11
for in this way entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly provided to you.
###### 12
Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you *already* know them and are established in the truth which is [^g]held firmly in your grasp.  
###### 13
I think it right, as long as I am in this *earthly* tent, to inspire you by reminding you,  
###### 14
knowing that the laying aside of this *earthly* tent of mine is imminent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.  
###### 15
Moreover, I will diligently endeavor {to see to it} that even after my departure you will be able, at all times, to call these things to mind.

## Eyewitnesses
###### 16
For we did not follow cleverly devised stories *or* myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were [^h]eyewitnesses of His majesty {His grandeur, His authority, His sovereignty}.  
###### 17
For when He was invested with honor and {the radiance of the [^i]Shekinah} glory from God the Father, such a voice as this came to Him from the {splendid} Majestic Glory {in the bright cloud that overshadowed Him, saying}, [^j]"This is My Son, My Beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased *and* delighted"--  
###### 18
and we {actually} heard this voice made from heaven when we were together with Him on the holy mountain.
###### 19
So we have the prophetic word made more certain. You do well to pay {close} attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns *and* light breaks through the gloom and the [^k]morning star arises in your hearts.  
###### 20
But[^l] understand this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is *a matter* of *or* comes from one's own {personal or special} interpretation,
###### 21
for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.

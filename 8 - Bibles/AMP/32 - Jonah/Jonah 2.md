## Jonah's Prayer
###### 1
Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish,  
###### 2
and said,
"I called out of my trouble *and* distress to the LORD,  
And He answered me;  
Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help,  
And You heard my voice.  
###### 3
"For You cast me into the deep,  
Into the {deep} heart of the seas,  
And the currents surrounded *and* engulfed me;  
All Your breakers and billowing waves passed over me.  
###### 4
"Then I said, 'I have been cast out of Your sight.  
Nevertheless I will look again toward Your holy temple.'  
###### 5
"The waters surrounded me, to the point of death.  
The great deep engulfed me,  
Seaweed was wrapped around my head.  
###### 6
"I descended to the {very} roots of the mountains.  
The earth with its bars closed behind me {bolting me in} forever,  
Yet You have brought up my life from the pit (death), O LORD my God.  
###### 7
"When my soul was fainting within me,  
I remembered the LORD,  
And my prayer came to You,  
Into Your holy temple.  
###### 8
"Those who regard *and* follow worthless idols  
Turn[^a] away from their {living source of} mercy *and* lovingkindness.
###### 9
"But {as for me}, I will sacrifice to You  
With the voice of thanksgiving;  
I shall pay that which I have vowed.  
Salvation is from the LORD!"
###### 10
So the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.

## Made Alive in Christ
###### 1
And you {He made alive when you} were {spiritually} dead *and* separated from Him because of your transgressions and sins,  
###### 2
in which you once walked. You were following the ways of this world {influenced by this present age}, in accordance with the prince of the power of the air (Satan), the spirit who is now at work in the disobedient {the unbelieving, who fight against the purposes of God}.  
###### 3
Among these {unbelievers} we all once lived in the passions of our flesh {our behavior governed by the sinful self}, indulging the desires of [^a]human nature {without the Holy Spirit} and {the impulses} of the {sinful} mind. We were, by nature, children {under the sentence} of {God's} wrath, just like the rest {of mankind}.  
###### 4
But God, being {so very} rich in mercy, because of His great *and* wonderful love with which He loved us,  
###### 5
even when we were {spiritually} dead *and* separated from Him because of our sins, He made us {spiritually} alive together with Christ (for by His grace--His undeserved favor and mercy--you have been saved from God's judgment).  
###### 6
And He raised us up together with Him {when we believed}, and seated us with Him in the heavenly *places*, {because we are} in Christ Jesus,  
###### 7
{and He did this} so that in the ages to come He might {clearly} show the immeasurable *and* unsurpassed riches of His grace in {His} kindness toward us in Christ Jesus {by providing for our redemption}.  
###### 8
For it is by grace {God's remarkable compassion and favor drawing you to Christ} that you have been saved {actually delivered from judgment and given eternal life} through faith. And this {salvation} is not of yourselves {not through your own effort}, but it is the {undeserved, gracious} gift of God;  
###### 9
not as a result of {your} works {nor your attempts to keep the Law}, so that no one will {be able to} boast *or* take credit in any way {for his salvation}.  
###### 10
For we are His workmanship {His own master work, a work of art}, created in Christ Jesus {reborn from above--spiritually transformed, renewed, ready to be used} for good works, which God prepared {for us} beforehand {taking paths which He set}, so that we would walk in them {living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us}.
###### 11
Therefore, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, who are called "Uncircumcision" by those who called themselves "Circumcision," {itself a mere mark} *which is* made in the flesh by human hands--  
###### 12
*remember* that at that time you were separated from Christ {excluded from any relationship with Him}, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise {with no share in the sacred Messianic promise and without knowledge of God's agreements}, having no hope {in His promise} and {living} in the world without God.  
###### 13
But now {at this very moment} in Christ Jesus you who once were {so very} far away {from God} have been brought near [^b]by the blood of Christ.  
###### 14
For He Himself is our peace *and* our bond of unity. He who made both *groups*--{Jews and Gentiles}--*into* one body and broke down the barrier, the dividing wall {of spiritual antagonism between us},  
###### 15
by abolishing in His {own crucified} flesh the hostility *caused by* the Law with its commandments *contained* in ordinances {which He satisfied}; so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thereby establishing peace.  
###### 16
And {that He} might reconcile them both {Jew and Gentile, united} in one body to God through the cross, thereby putting to death the hostility.  
###### 17
And He came and preached the good news of peace to you {Gentiles} who were far away, and peace to those {Jews} who were near.  
###### 18
For it is through Him that we both have a {direct} way of approach in one Spirit to the Father.  
###### 19
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens {outsiders without rights of citizenship}, but you are fellow citizens with the saints (God's people), and are {members} of God's household,  
###### 20
having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the {chief} Cornerstone,  
###### 21
in whom the whole structure is joined together, and it continues {to increase} growing into a holy temple in the Lord {a sanctuary dedicated, set apart, and sacred to the presence of the Lord}.  
###### 22
In Him {and in fellowship with one another} you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.

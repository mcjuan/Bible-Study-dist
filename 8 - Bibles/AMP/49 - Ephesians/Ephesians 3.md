## Paul's Stewardship
###### 1
For this reason {because I preach that you and believing Jews are joint heirs} I, Paul, am the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles--  
###### 2
assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was entrusted to me {to share with you} for your benefit;  
###### 3
and that by {divine} revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have already written in brief.  
###### 4
By referring to this, when you read it you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,  
###### 5
which in other generations was not disclosed to mankind, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the {Holy} Spirit;  
###### 6
{it is this:} that the Gentiles are now joint heirs {with the Jews} and members of the same body, and joint partakers {sharing} in the {same divine} promise in Christ Jesus through {their faith in} the good news {of salvation}.  
###### 7
Of this {gospel} I was made a minister by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of His power.  
###### 8
To me, {though I am} the very least of all the saints (God's people), this grace {which is undeserved} was graciously given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the good news of the incomprehensible riches of Christ {that spiritual wealth which no one can fully understand},  
###### 9
and to make plain {to everyone} the plan of the mystery {regarding the uniting of believing Jews and Gentiles into one body} which {until now} was kept hidden through the ages in {the mind of} God who created all things.  
###### 10
So now through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God {in all its countless aspects} might now be made known {revealing the mystery} to the {angelic} rulers and authorities in the heavenly *places*.  
###### 11
*This is* in accordance with {the terms of} the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,  
###### 12
in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him {that is, our faith gives us sufficient courage to freely and openly approach God through Christ}.  
###### 13
So I ask you not to lose heart at my sufferings on your behalf, for they are your glory *and* honor.
###### 14
For this reason {grasping the greatness of this plan by which Jews and Gentiles are joined together in Christ} I bow my knees {in reverence} before the Father {of our Lord Jesus Christ},  
###### 15
from whom every family in heaven and on earth [^a]derives its name {God--the first and ultimate Father}.  
###### 16
May He grant you out of the riches of His glory, to be strengthened *and* spiritually energized with power through His Spirit in your inner self, {indwelling your innermost being and personality},  
###### 17
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through your faith. And may you, having been {deeply} rooted and {securely} grounded in love,  
###### 18
be fully capable of comprehending with all the saints (God's people) the width and length and height and depth of His love {fully experiencing that amazing, endless love};  
###### 19
and {that you may come} to know {practically, through personal experience} the love of Christ which far surpasses {mere} knowledge {without experience}, that you may be filled up {throughout your being} to all the fullness of God {so that you may have the richest experience of God's presence in your lives, completely filled and flooded with God Himself}.
###### 20
Now to Him who is able to {carry out His purpose and} do superabundantly more than all that we dare ask or think {infinitely beyond our greatest prayers, hopes, or dreams}, according to His power that is at work within us,  
###### 21
to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations forever and ever. Amen.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Ephesians 3:15 In Greek, the word for family is *patria*, which is derived from *pater*, the word for “father.” The concept of family originates with God.

## Choosing of the Seven
###### 1
Now about this time, when the number of disciples was increasing, a complaint was made by the [^a]Hellenists (Greek-speaking Jews) against the {[^b]native} Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily serving *of food*.  
###### 2
So the [^c]Twelve called the disciples together and said, "It is not appropriate for us to neglect {teaching} the word of God in order to serve tables *and* manage the distribution of food.  
###### 3
Therefore, brothers, choose from among you seven men with good reputations {men of godly character and moral integrity}, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task.  
###### 4
But we will {continue to} devote ourselves {steadfastly} to prayer and to the ministry of the word."  
###### 5
The suggestion pleased the whole congregation; and they selected [^d]Stephen, a man full of faith {in Christ Jesus}, and {filled with and led by} the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas (Nikolaos), a proselyte (Gentile convert) from Antioch.  
###### 6
They brought these men before the apostles; and after praying, they laid their hands on them {to dedicate and commission them for this service}.
###### 7
And the message of God kept on growing *and* spreading, and the number of disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem; and a large number of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith {accepting Jesus as Messiah and acknowledging Him as the Source of eternal salvation}.
###### 8
Now Stephen, full of grace (divine blessing, favor) and power, was doing great wonders and signs (attesting miracles) among the people.  
###### 9
However, some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (freed Jewish slaves), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and {the province of} Asia, rose up and questioned *and* argued with Stephen.  
###### 10
But they were not able to successfully withstand *and* cope with the wisdom *and* the intelligence {and the power and inspiration} of the Spirit by whom he was speaking.  
###### 11
Then {to attack him another way} they secretly instructed men to say, "We have heard this man {Stephen} speak blasphemous (slanderous, sacrilegious, abusive) words against Moses and *against* God."  
###### 12
And they provoked *and* incited the people, as well as the elders and the scribes, and they came up to Stephen and seized him and brought him before the Council (Sanhedrin, Jewish High Court).  
###### 13
They presented false witnesses who said, "This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the Law {of Moses};  
###### 14
for we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will tear down this place and will change the traditions *and* customs which Moses handed down to us."  
###### 15
Then all those who were sitting in the Council, stared {intently} at him, and they saw that Stephen's face was like the face of an angel.

[^c]: Acts 6:2 See note Matt 10:2.
[^d]: Acts 6:5 These seven men had Greek names, so they may have been Greek in ancestry, language, or way of life; however, Stephen, in his defense before the Sanhedrin (ch 7), exhibited an extensive knowledge of Jewish history.

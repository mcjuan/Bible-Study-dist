## Peter Reports at Jerusalem
###### 1
Now the apostles and the believers who were throughout Judea heard {with astonishment} that the Gentiles also had received *and* accepted the word of God {the message concerning salvation through Christ}.  
###### 2
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision {certain Jewish believers who followed the Law} took issue with him {for violating Jewish customs},  
###### 3
saying, "You went to uncircumcised men and {even} ate with them!"  
###### 4
But Peter began {at the beginning} and explained {the events} to them step by step, saying,  
###### 5
"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision of an object coming down from heaven, like a huge sheet being lowered by the four corners; and {it descended until} it came right down to me,  
###### 6
and looking closely at it, I saw *all kinds of* the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air {both clean and unclean according to the Law},  
###### 7
and I also heard a voice saying to me, 'Get up, Peter; kill and eat.'  
###### 8
But I said, 'Not at all, Lord; for nothing common (unholy) or {ceremonially} unclean has ever entered my mouth.'  
###### 9
But the voice from heaven answered a second time, 'What God has cleansed *and* pronounced clean, no longer consider common (unholy).'  
###### 10
This happened three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven.  
###### 11
And right then the three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were *staying*.  
###### 12
The Spirit told me to go with them without the slightest hesitation. So these six brothers also went with me and we went to the man's house.  
###### 13
And Cornelius told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send *word* to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;  
###### 14
he will bring a message to you by which you will be saved {and granted eternal life}, you and all your household.'  
###### 15
When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as *He did* on us at the beginning {at Pentecost}.  
###### 16
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'  
###### 17
So, if God gave Gentiles the same gift {equally} as He gave us after we accepted *and* believed *and* trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ {as Savior}, who was I to interfere *or* stand in God's way?"  
###### 18
When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified *and* praised God, saying, "Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance *that leads* to *eternal* life {that is, real life after earthly death}."

## The Church at Antioch
###### 19
So then {since they were unaware of these developments} those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with {the stoning of} Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, without telling the message {of salvation through Christ} to anyone except Jews.  
###### 20
But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and *began* speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming {to them} the good news about the Lord Jesus.  
###### 21
And the hand (the power and presence) of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord {for salvation, accepting and drawing near to Jesus as Messiah and Savior}.  
###### 22
The news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  
###### 23
When he arrived and saw the grace of God {that was bestowed on them}, he rejoiced and *began* to encourage them all with an unwavering heart to stay true *and* devoted to the Lord.  
###### 24
For Barnabas was a good man {privately and publicly--his godly character benefited both himself and others} and *he was* full of the Holy Spirit and full of faith {in Jesus the Messiah, through whom believers have everlasting life}. And a great number of people were brought to the Lord.  
###### 25
And Barnabas left for Tarsus to search for Saul;  
###### 26
and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. For an entire year they met {with others} in the church and instructed large numbers; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
###### 27
Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.  
###### 28
One of them named Agabus stood up and prophesied through the {Holy} Spirit that a severe famine would come on the [^a]entire world. And this did happen during the reign of [^b]Claudius.  
###### 29
So the disciples decided to send *a contribution*, each according to his individual ability, to the believers who lived in Judea.  
###### 30
And this they did, sending the contribution to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.

## God Will Bless Judah and Ephraim
###### 1
Ask *for* rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain.  
It is the LORD who makes the thunder clouds;  
And He will give them showers of rain, grass in the field to everyone.  
###### 2
For the teraphim (household idols) speak wickedness (emptiness, worthlessness),  
And the diviners see lying visions  
And tell false dreams;  
They comfort in vain.  
Therefore the people wander like sheep,  
They are afflicted *and* suffer because there is no shepherd.  
###### 3
"My anger is kindled against the shepherds {who are not true shepherds},  
And I shall punish the male goats (leaders);  
For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah (the Southern Kingdom),  
And will make them like His beautiful *and* majestic horse in the battle.  
###### 4
"From them (Judah) shall come the [^a]Cornerstone,  
From them the tent peg,  
From them the bow of battle,  
From them every ruler, all of them together.  
###### 5
"They will be like mighty men  
Trampling down *their enemies* in the mire of the streets in the battle;  
And they will fight because the LORD is with them,  
And the {enemies'} riders on horses will be shamed.  
###### 6
"I will strengthen the house of Judah {making it superior},  
And I will save the house of Joseph.  
I will bring them back {and allow them to live securely},  
Because I have had compassion on them.  
They will be as though I had not rejected them,  
For I am the LORD their God, and I will listen *and* answer them.  
###### 7
"Then [^b]Ephraim will be like a mighty warrior,  
And their heart will rejoice as if from wine;  
Yes, their children will see it and rejoice;  
Their heart will rejoice *and* shout triumphantly in the LORD.  
###### 8
"I will [^c]whistle for them and gather them together,  
For I have redeemed them;  
And they will increase {again} as they have increased before {in Egypt}.  
###### 9
"When I scatter them among the nations,  
They will remember Me in far countries,  
And with their children they will live and come back {to Me and the land I gave them}.  
###### 10
"I will bring them (all Israel) back home again from the land of Egypt  
And gather them from Assyria,  
And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon {the land on the east and on the west of the Jordan}  
Until no room can be found for them.  
###### 11
"And they will pass through the sea of distress *and* anxiety {with the LORD leading His people, as at the Red Sea}  
And He will strike the waves in the sea,  
So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up;  
And the pride of Assyria will be brought down  
And the scepter {of the taskmasters} of Egypt will pass away.  
###### 12
"And I will strengthen Israel in the LORD,  
And they will walk {and glory} in His name," declares the LORD.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Zechariah 10:4 Probably Messianic, see the “Cornerstone” imagery of Ps 118:22, 23; Is 28:16; Matt 21:42; Acts 4:11; Eph 2:19-22; 1 Pet 2:6-8.
[^b]: Zechariah 10:7 A reference to the Northern Kingdom.
[^c]: Zechariah 10:8 Or *hiss*. From this verse a rabbinical tradition was invented that if a vulture settles on the ground and hisses, the Messiah will come immediately. It was reported to have happened once, but instead of the Messiah coming, the story went that a stone fell on the vulture’s head and killed it because it was a liar.

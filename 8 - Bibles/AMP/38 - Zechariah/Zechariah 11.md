## The Doomed Flock
###### 1
Open your doors, O Lebanon,  
That fire may devour your cedars.  
###### 2
Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen,  
Because the magnificent trees have been destroyed;  
Wail, O oaks of Bashan,  
For the inaccessible forest {on the steep mountainside} has come down.  
###### 3
There is a sound of the shepherds' wail,  
For their splendor (grazing land) is ruined;  
There is a sound of the young lions' roar,  
For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
###### 4
Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock *doomed* for slaughter,  
###### 5
whose buyers slay them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them *nor* protect them {from the wolves}.  
###### 6
For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into the hand of another and into the hands of his {foreign} king. And the enemy will strike the land, and I will not rescue the people from their hand."
###### 7
So I {Zechariah} pastured the flock *doomed* for slaughter, truly {as the name implies} the most miserable of sheep. And I took two {shepherd's} staffs, the one I called Favor (Grace) and the other I called Union (Bonds); so I pastured the flock.  
###### 8
Then I eliminated the three {incompetent, unfit} shepherds {the civil rulers, the priests, and the prophets} in one month, for I was impatient with them, and they also were tired of me *and* despised me.  
###### 9
So I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let the survivors devour one another's flesh."  
###### 10
I took my staff, Favor, and broke it in pieces, breaking the covenant which I had made with all the peoples.  
###### 11
So the covenant was broken on that day, and thus the most wretched of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.  
###### 12
I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, do not." So they weighed out [^a]thirty pieces of silver as my wages.  
###### 13
Then[^b] the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter {as if to the dogs}--that *magnificent* sum at which I am valued by them!" So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.
###### 14
Then I broke my second staff, Union, into pieces to break the brotherhood between Judah (the Southern Kingdom) and Israel (the Northern Kingdom).
###### 15
The LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment {of a shepherd, but this time} of a foolish shepherd.  
###### 16
For behold, I am going to raise up a {false} shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or feed the healthy; but will eat the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hoofs {to consume everything}.
###### 17
"Woe (judgment is coming) to the worthless *and* foolish shepherd  
Who deserts the flock!  
The sword will strike his arm  
And his right eye!  
His arm shall be totally withered  
And his right eye completely blinded."

### Footnotes
[^a]: Zechariah 11:12 Since the type of coin is not stated, shekels can be assumed. The shekel was the standard wage for a day of labor, and the payment was *weighed* because the shekel was actually a unit of weight.
[^b]: Zechariah 11:13 At this point the pre-incarnate Christ intervenes and prophetically refers to the payment given by the religious leaders to Judas for his betrayal (Matt 26:15).

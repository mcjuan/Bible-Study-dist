## The Lost Sheep
###### 1
Now all the tax collectors and sinners {including non-observant Jews} were coming near Jesus to listen to Him.  
###### 2
Both the Pharisees and the scribes *began* muttering *and* complaining, saying, "This man accepts *and* welcomes sinners and eats with them."
###### 3
So He told them this parable:  
###### 4
"What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost, {searching} until he finds it?  
###### 5
And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.  
###### 6
And when he gets home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my lost sheep!'  
###### 7
I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.

## The Lost Coin
###### 8
"Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins {each one equal to a day's wages} and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?  
###### 9
And when she has found it, she calls together her {women} friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, because I found the lost coin!'  
###### 10
In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents {that is, changes his inner self--his old way of thinking, regrets past sins, lives his life in a way that proves repentance; and seeks God's purpose for his life}."

## The Prodigal Son
###### 11
Then He said, "A certain man had two sons.  
###### 12
The younger of them {inappropriately} said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the property that falls to me.' So he divided the estate between them.  
###### 13
A few days later, the younger son gathered together everything {that he had} and traveled to a distant country, and there he wasted his fortune in reckless *and* immoral living.  
###### 14
Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began to do without *and* be in need.  
###### 15
So he went and forced himself on one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to [^a]feed pigs.  
###### 16
He would have gladly eaten the {carob} pods that the pigs were eating {but they could not satisfy his hunger}, and no one was giving *anything* to him.  
###### 17
But when he {finally} came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more than enough food, while I am dying here of hunger!  
###### 18
I will get up and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight.  
###### 19
I am no longer worthy to be called your son; {just} treat me like one of your hired men."'  
###### 20
So he got up and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion *for him*, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.  
###### 21
And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'  
###### 22
But the father said to his servants, 'Quickly bring out the best robe {for the guest of honor} and put it on him; and give him a [^b]ring for his hand, and sandals for his feet.  
###### 23
And bring the fattened calf and slaughter it, and let us {invite everyone and} feast and celebrate;  
###### 24
for this son of mine was {as good as} dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.' So they began to celebrate.
###### 25
"Now his older son was in the field; and when he returned and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.  
###### 26
So he summoned one of the servants and *began* asking what this {celebration} meant.  
###### 27
And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has received him back safe and sound.'  
###### 28
But the elder brother became angry *and* deeply resentful and was not willing to go in; and his father came out and *began* pleading with him.  
###### 29
But he said to his father, 'Look! These many years I have served you, and I have never neglected *or* disobeyed your command. Yet you have never given me {so much as} a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;  
###### 30
but when this {other} son of yours arrived, who has devoured your estate with immoral women, you slaughtered that fattened calf for him!'  
###### 31
The father said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.  
###### 32
But it was fitting to celebrate and rejoice, for this brother of yours was {as good as} dead and *has begun* to live. He was lost and has been found.'"

### Footnotes
[^a]: Luke 15:15 This would have seemed especially disgusting to Jesus’ Jewish listeners because pigs were ceremonially unclean animals, forbidden to them as food.
[^b]: Luke 15:22 I.e. a symbol of his authority as a son.

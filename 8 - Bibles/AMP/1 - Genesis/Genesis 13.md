## Abram and Lot
###### 1
So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot {his nephew} with him, into the Negev (the South country of Judah).
###### 2
Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold.  
###### 3
He journeyed on from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,  
###### 4
where he had first built an altar; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD {in prayer}.  
###### 5
But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.  
###### 6
Now the land was not able to support them {that is, sustain all their grazing and water needs} while they lived near one another, for their possessions were too great for them to stay together.  
###### 7
And there was strife *and* quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were living in the land at that same time {making grazing of the livestock difficult}.
###### 8
So Abram said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife *and* disagreement between you and me, nor between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, because we are relatives.  
###### 9
Is not the entire land before you? Please separate {yourself} from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right, then I will go to the left."  
###### 10
So Lot looked and saw that the valley of the Jordan was well watered everywhere--this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; {it was all} like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar {at the south end of the Dead Sea}.  
###### 11
Then Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and he traveled east. So they separated from each other.  
###### 12
Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the valley and camped as far as Sodom *and* lived there.  
###### 13
But the men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful against the LORD {unashamed in their open sin before Him}.
###### 14
The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had left him, "Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are *standing*, northward and southward and eastward and westward;  
###### 15
for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever.  
###### 16
I will make your descendants {as numerous} as the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the {grains of} dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted.  
###### 17
Arise, walk (make a thorough reconnaissance) around in the land, through its length and its width, for I will give it to you."  
###### 18
Then Abram broke camp *and* moved his tent, and came and settled by the {grove of the great} terebinths (oak trees) of Mamre {the Amorite}, which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to {honor} the LORD.

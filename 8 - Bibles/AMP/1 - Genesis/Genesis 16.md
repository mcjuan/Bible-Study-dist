## Sarai and Hagar
###### 1
Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not borne him any *children*, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar.  
###### 2
So Sarai said to Abram, "See here, the LORD has prevented me from bearing *children*. I am asking you to go in to {the bed of} my maid {so that she may bear you a child}; perhaps I will [^a]obtain children by her." And Abram listened to Sarai *and* did as she said.  
###### 3
After Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years, Abram's wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian {maid}, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his {secondary} wife.  
###### 4
He went in to {the bed of} Hagar, and she conceived; and when she realized that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress {regarding Sarai as insignificant because of her infertility}.  
###### 5
Then Sarai said to Abram, "May {the responsibility for} the wrong done to me {by the arrogant behavior of Hagar} be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, and when she realized that she had conceived, I was despised *and* looked on with disrespect. May the LORD judge {who has done right} between you and me."  
###### 6
But Abram said to Sarai, "Look, your maid is *entirely* in your hands *and* subject to your authority; do as you please with her." So Sarai treated her harshly *and* humiliated her, and Hagar fled from her.
###### 7
But [^b]the Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, on the road to {Egypt by way of} Shur.  
###### 8
And He said, "Hagar, Sarai's maid, where did you come from and where are you going?" And she said, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai."  
###### 9
The Angel of the LORD said to her, "Go back to your mistress, and submit [^c]humbly to her authority."  
###### 10
Then the Angel of the LORD said to her, "I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count."  
###### 11
The Angel of the LORD continued,
"Behold, you are with child,  
And you will bear a son;  
And you shall name him Ishmael (God hears),  
Because the LORD has heard *and* paid attention to your persecution (suffering).  
###### 12
"He (Ishmael) will be a wild donkey of a man;  
His hand *will be* against every man {continually fighting}  
And every man's hand against him;  
And he will dwell in defiance of all his brothers."
###### 13
Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, "You are [^d]God Who Sees"; for she said, "Have I not even here {in the wilderness} remained alive after [^e]seeing Him {who sees me with understanding and compassion}?"  
###### 14
Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me); it is [^f]between Kadesh and Bered.
###### 15
So Hagar gave birth to Abram's son; and Abram named his son, to whom Hagar gave birth, [^g]Ishmael (God hears).  
###### 16
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Genesis 16:2 This must have been an acceptable practice in that time and culture, based on the idea that the children of such a union would belong to the owner of the slave-girl. Abram undoubtedly had informed Sarai of God’s promise to him, and Sarai perhaps thought that this was necessary in order to bring about God’s plan for them.
[^b]: Genesis 16:7 This is the first occurrence of “Angel of the Lord (*YHWH*)” in Scripture. The Hebrew word for “angel” means “messenger” (an angel of God is a special messenger from God who speaks for and is closely identified with Him) and context determines whether the messenger is an angel or a human. The same is true for Greek, and the word “angel” is an English form (transliteration) of the Gr *aggelos*. The *Angel of the *Lord can be a special case, however. Many Bible scholars believe that this *Angel* may be a theophany, that is, a physical manifestation of God, in which case the word *Angel* is capitalized. The *Angel of the *Lord may, based on context, be the pre-incarnate Christ, the Son of God.
[^c]: Genesis 16:9 Lit *under her hands*.
[^d]: Genesis 16:13 Heb *El roi*; God never sleeps, He sees, He is aware, He is the great Omnipresent God.
[^e]: Genesis 16:13 Or *seen the back of Him who sees me*, which would suggest that at some point in their conversation Hagar requested to see the divine Angel (see note v 7) and, as in Moses’ encounter with God (Ex 33:18-23), was granted the privilege of seeing His back. The wording of the Hebrew is not clear enough to further narrow the possibilities.
[^f]: Genesis 16:14 This, “it is between Kadesh and Bered,” is further proof of the antiquity of the original names, since the place had to be identified to the reader in the time of Moses.
[^g]: Genesis 16:15 Ishmael was the first person whom God named before his birth (Gen 16:11). Others were: Isaac (Gen 17:19); Josiah (1 Kin 13:2); Solomon (1 Chr 22:9); Jesus (Matt 1:21); and John the Baptist (Luke 1:13).

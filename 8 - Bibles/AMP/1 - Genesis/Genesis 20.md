## Abraham's Deception
###### 1
Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the Negev (the South country), and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived temporarily in Gerar.  
###### 2
Abraham [^a]said {again} of Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." So [^b]Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took [^c]Sarah {into his harem}.  
###### 3
But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night, and said, "Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken {as your wife}, for she is another man's wife."  
###### 4
Now Abimelech had not yet come near her; so he said, "Lord, will you kill a people who are righteous *and* innocent *and* blameless {regarding Sarah}?  
###### 5
Did Abraham not tell me, 'She is my sister?' And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this."  
###### 6
Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this in the integrity of your heart, for it was I who kept you back *and* spared you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not give you an opportunity to touch her.  
###### 7
So now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return *her* {to him}, know that you shall die, you and all who are yours (your household)."
###### 8
So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were terrified.  
###### 9
Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? And how have I offended you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me what ought not to be done {to anyone}."  
###### 10
And Abimelech said to Abraham, "What have you encountered *or* seen {in us or our customs}, that you have done this {unjust} thing?"  
###### 11
Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely there is no fear *or* reverence of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'  
###### 12
Besides, she actually is my {half} sister; she is the daughter of my father {Terah}, but not of my mother; and she became my wife.  
###### 13
When God caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, 'This kindness *and* loyalty you can show me: at every place we stop, say of me, "He is my brother."'"  
###### 14
Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him {as God commanded}.  
###### 15
So Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please."  
###### 16
Then to Sarah he said, "Look, I have given this brother of yours a [^d]thousand pieces of silver; it is to compensate you {for all that has happened} *and* to vindicate your honor before all who are with you; before all men you are cleared *and* compensated."  
###### 17
So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, and they *again* gave birth to *children*,  
###### 18
for the LORD had securely closed the wombs of all {the women} in Abimelech's household because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Genesis 20:2 See 12:11-13.
[^b]: Genesis 20:2 The word “Abimelech” may be a royal title instead of a proper name. In either case this man is probably the father or grandfather of Abimelech king of the Philistines encountered later by Isaac (26:1).
[^c]: Genesis 20:2 Sarah was about ninety years old at this time.
[^d]: Genesis 20:16 Perhaps about three years’ or a thousand days’ wages.

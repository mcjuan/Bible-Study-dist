## The Overthrow of Nineveh
###### 1
The[^a] one who scatters has come up against you {Nineveh}.
Man the fortress *and* ramparts, watch the road;  
Strengthen[^b] your back {prepare for battle}, summon all your strength.
###### 2
For the LORD will restore the splendor *and* majesty of Jacob  
Like the splendor of {ancient and united} Israel,  
Even though destroyers have destroyed them  
And ruined their vine branches.
###### 3
The shields of his soldiers {of [^c]Media and Babylon} are colored red;  
The warriors are dressed in scarlet.  
The chariots blaze with fire of {flashing} steel  
When he is prepared *to march*,  
And the cypress *spears* are brandished {for battle}.  
###### 4
The chariots race madly in the streets;  
They rush wildly in the broad plazas.  
Their appearance is like torches;  
They rush in various directions like forked lightning.  
###### 5
He[^d] remembers *and* summons his nobles;
They stumble in their march {terrified because of the attack}.  
They hurry to the city wall,  
And the [^e]mantelet is prepared *and* firmly set up.  
###### 6
The gates of the rivers {surrounding Nineveh} are opened  
And the palace {of sun-dried brick} is dissolved {by the torrents}.  
###### 7
It is decreed:  
Nineveh is stripped, and she is carried away,  
And her handmaids are moaning like the sound of doves,  
Beating on their breasts {in sorrow}.
###### 8
Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,  
Now her inhabitants are fleeing;  
"Stop! Stop!" {a few cry,}  
But no one turns back.  
###### 9
Plunder the silver!  
Plunder the gold!  
For there is no end to the treasure--  
Wealth from every precious object.  
###### 10
She is emptied! She is desolate and waste!  
Hearts melting {in fear} and knees knocking!  
Anguish is in the whole body,  
And the faces of all grow pale!  
###### 11
Where is the den of the lions (Assyria)  
And the feeding place of the young lions,  
Where the lion, lioness, and lion's cub prowled  
With nothing to fear?  
###### 12
The lion {of Assyria} tore enough for his cubs (Assyrian citizens),  
Killed {enough prey} for his lionesses,  
And filled his lairs with prey  
And his dens with torn flesh.
###### 13
"Behold, I am against you {Nineveh}," declares the LORD of hosts, "and I will burn your chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the land, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."

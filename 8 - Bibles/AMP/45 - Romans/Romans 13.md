## Be Subject to Government
###### 1
Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God {granted by His permission and sanction}, and those which exist have been put in place by God.  
###### 2
Therefore whoever [^a]resists {governmental} authority resists the ordinance of God. And those who have resisted it will bring judgment (civil penalty) on themselves.  
###### 3
For {civil} authorities are not a source of fear for {people of} good behavior, but for {those who do} evil. Do you want to be unafraid of authority? Do what is good and you will receive approval *and* commendation.  
###### 4
For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, {you should} be afraid; for he does not carry the {executioner's} sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an avenger who brings punishment on the wrongdoer.  
###### 5
Therefore one must be subject {to civil authorities}, not only to escape the punishment {that comes with wrongdoing}, but also as a matter of principle {knowing what is right before God}.  
###### 6
For this same reason you pay taxes, for *civil authorities* are God's servants, devoting themselves to governance.  
###### 7
Pay to all what is due: tax to whom tax *is due*, customs to whom customs, respect to whom respect, honor to whom honor.
###### 8
Owe[^b] nothing to anyone except to [^c]love *and* seek the best for one another; for he who {unselfishly} loves his neighbor has fulfilled the {essence of the} law {relating to one's fellowman}.
###### 9
The commandments, "You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet," and any other commandment are summed up in this statement: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."  
###### 10
Love does no wrong to a neighbor {it never hurts anyone}. Therefore {unselfish} love is the fulfillment of the Law.
###### 11
Do this, knowing that this is a critical time. It is already the hour for you to awaken from your sleep {of spiritual complacency}; for our salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed {in Christ}.  
###### 12
The night {this present evil age} is almost gone and the day {of Christ's return} is almost here. So let us fling away the works of darkness and put on the {full} armor of light.  
###### 13
Let us conduct ourselves properly *and* honorably as in the {light of} day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and irresponsibility, not in quarreling and jealousy.  
###### 14
But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for {nor even think about gratifying} the flesh in regard to its improper desires.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Romans 13:2 An exception to this is recorded in Acts 5:27-29. See especially v 29.
[^b]: Romans 13:8 Debt is generally to be avoided, but Paul probably is addressing debt to individuals with whom one has a personal relationship.
[^c]: Romans 13:8 The key to understanding this and other statements about love is to know that this love (the Greek word *agape*) is not so much a matter of emotion as it is of doing things for the benefit of another person, that is, having an unselfish concern for another and a willingness to seek the best for other believers.

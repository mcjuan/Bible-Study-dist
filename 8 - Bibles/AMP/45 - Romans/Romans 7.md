## Believers United to Christ
###### 1
Or do you not know, [^a]brothers and sisters (for I am speaking to those who know the Law), that the Law has jurisdiction {to rule} over a person as long as he lives?  
###### 2
For the married woman {as an example} is bound *and* remains bound by law to her husband while he lives; but if her husband dies, she is released *and* exempt from the law concerning her husband.  
###### 3
Accordingly, she will be designated as an adulteress if she [^b]unites herself to another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law {regarding marriage}, so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
###### 4
Therefore, my [^c]fellow believers, you too died to the Law through the {crucified} body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.  
###### 5
When we were *living* in the flesh {trapped by sin}, the sinful passions, which were awakened by {that which} the Law {identifies as sin}, were at work in our body to bear fruit for death {since the willingness to sin led to death and separation from God}.  
###### 6
But now we have been released from the Law *and* its penalty, having died {through Christ} to that by which we were held captive, so that we serve {God} in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter {of the Law}.
###### 7
What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, if it had not been for the Law, I would not have recognized sin. For I would not have known {for example} about coveting {what belongs to another, and would have had no sense of guilt} if the Law had not {repeatedly} said, "You shall not covet."  
###### 8
But sin, finding an opportunity through the commandment {to express itself} produced in me every kind of coveting *and* selfish desire. For without the Law sin is dead {the recognition of sin is inactive}.  
###### 9
I was once alive without {knowledge of} the Law; but when the commandment came {and I understood its meaning}, sin became alive and I died {since the Law sentenced me to death}.  
###### 10
And the *very* commandment which was intended to bring life, actually proved to bring death for me.  
###### 11
For sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, beguiled *and* completely deceived me, and [^d]using it as a weapon killed me {separating me from God}.  
###### 12
So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
###### 13
Did that which is good {the Law}, then become death to me? Certainly not! But sin, in order that it might be revealed as sin, was producing death in me by {using} this good thing {as a weapon}, so that through the commandment sin would become exceedingly sinful.

## The Conflict of Two Natures
###### 14
We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am *a creature* of the flesh {worldly, self-reliant--carnal and unspiritual}, sold into slavery to sin {and serving under its control}.  
###### 15
For I do not understand my own actions {I am baffled and bewildered by them}. I do not practice what I want *to do*, but I am doing the very thing I hate {and yielding to my human nature, my worldliness--my sinful capacity}.  
###### 16
Now if I *habitually* do what I do not want to do, {that means} I agree with the Law, *confessing* that it is good (morally excellent).  
###### 17
So now {if that is the case, then} it is no longer I who do it {the disobedient thing which I despise}, but the sin {nature} which lives in me.  
###### 18
For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh {my human nature, my worldliness--my sinful capacity}. For the willingness {to do good} is present in me, but the doing of good is not.  
###### 19
For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want.  
###### 20
But if I am doing the very thing I do not want to do, I am no longer the one doing it {that is, it is not me that acts}, but the sin {nature} which lives in me.
###### 21
So I find *it to be* the law {of my inner self}, that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good.  
###### 22
For I joyfully delight in the law of God in my inner self {with my new nature},  
###### 23
but I see a different law *and* rule of action in the members of my body {in its appetites and desires}, waging war against the law of my mind *and* subduing me and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is within my members.  
###### 24
Wretched *and* miserable man that I am! Who will {rescue me and} set me free from this body of death {this corrupt, mortal existence}?  
###### 25
Thanks be to God {for my deliverance} through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind serve the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh {my human nature, my worldliness, my sinful capacity--I serve} the law of sin.

### Footnotes
[^a]: Romans 7:1 Lit *brethren*.
[^b]: Romans 7:3 Lit *becomes another man’s*, probably referring to an illicit, sexual relationship. Paul uses the same language at the end of the verse, but there he probably means sexual intimacy within a new marriage.
[^c]: Romans 7:4 Lit *brethren*.
[^d]: Romans 7:11 Lit *through it killed me*.

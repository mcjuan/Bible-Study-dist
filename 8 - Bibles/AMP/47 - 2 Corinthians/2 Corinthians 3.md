## Ministers of a New Covenant
###### 1
Are we starting to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some {false teachers}, letters of recommendation to you or from you? {No!}  
###### 2
You are our letter {of recommendation}, written in our hearts, recognized and read by everyone.  
###### 3
You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
###### 4
Such is the confidence *and* steadfast reliance *and* absolute trust that we have through Christ toward God.  
###### 5
Not that we are sufficiently qualified in ourselves to claim anything as *coming* from us, but our sufficiency *and* qualifications come from God.  
###### 6
He has qualified us {making us sufficient} as ministers of a new covenant {of salvation through Christ}, not of the letter {of a written code} but of the Spirit; for the letter {of the Law} kills {by revealing sin and demanding obedience}, but the Spirit gives life.
###### 7
Now if the ministry of death, engraved in letters on stones {the covenant of the Law which led to death because of sin}, came with such glory *and* splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, {a brilliance} that was fading,  
###### 8
how will the ministry of the Spirit {the new covenant which allows us to be Spirit-filled} fail to be even more glorious *and* splendid?  
###### 9
For if the ministry that brings condemnation {the old covenant, the Law} has glory, how much more does glory overflow in the ministry that brings righteousness {the new covenant which declares believers free of guilt and sets them apart for God's special purpose}!  
###### 10
Indeed, what had glory {the Law}, in this case no longer has glory because of the glory that surpasses it {the gospel}.  
###### 11
For if that {Law} which fades away *came* with glory, *how* much more *must* that {gospel} which remains *and* is permanent abide in glory *and* splendor!
###### 12
Since we have such a {glorious} hope *and* confident expectation, we speak with great courage,  
###### 13
and we are not like Moses, *who* used to put a veil over his face so that the Israelites would not gaze at the end of the glory which was fading away.  
###### 14
But {in fact} their minds were hardened {for they had lost the ability to understand}; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is removed {only} in Christ.  
###### 15
But to this day whenever Moses is read, a veil {of blindness} lies over their heart;  
###### 16
but whenever a person turns {in repentance and faith} to the Lord, the veil is taken away.  
###### 17
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, *there* is liberty {emancipation from bondage, true freedom}.  
###### 18
And we all, with unveiled face, *continually* seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are *progressively* being transformed into His image from {one degree of} glory to {even more} glory, which comes from the Lord, {who is} the Spirit.

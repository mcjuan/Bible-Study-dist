## Examine Yourselves
###### 1
This is the third time that I am visiting you. Every fact shall be sustained *and* confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.  
###### 2
I have already warned those who have sinned in the past and all the rest *as well*, and I warn them now even though I am absent {from you} as I did when I was with you the second time, that if I come back I will not spare *anyone*,  
###### 3
since you seek {forensic} proof that Christ is speaking in *and* through me. He is not weak *or* ineffective in dealing with you, but powerful within you.  
###### 4
For even though He was crucified in weakness {yielding Himself}, yet He lives {resurrected} by the power of God {His Father}. For we too are weak in Him {as He was humanly weak}, yet we are alive *and* well {in fellowship} with Him because of the power of God *directed* toward you.
###### 5
Test *and* evaluate yourselves *to see* whether you are in the faith *and* living your lives as {committed} believers. Examine yourselves {not me}! Or do you not recognize this about yourselves {by an ongoing experience} that Jesus Christ is in you--unless indeed you fail the test *and* are rejected as counterfeit?  
###### 6
But I hope you will acknowledge that we do not fail the test *nor* are we to be rejected.  
###### 7
But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong. Not so that we {and our teaching} may appear to be approved, but that you may continue doing what is right, even though we {by comparison} may seem to have failed.  
###### 8
For we can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth {and the gospel--the good news of salvation}.  
###### 9
We are glad when we are weak {since God's power comes freely through us}, but you {by comparison} are strong. We also pray for this, that you be made complete {fully restored, growing and maturing in godly character and spirit--pleasing your heavenly Father by the life you live}.  
###### 10
For this reason I am writing these things while absent from you, so that when I come, I will not need to deal severely {with you}, in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me {to be used} for building you up and not for tearing you down.
###### 11
Finally, believers, rejoice! Be made complete {be what you should be}, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace {enjoy the spiritual well-being experienced by believers who walk closely with God}; and the God of love and peace {the source of lovingkindness} will be with you.  
###### 12
Greet one another with a [^a]holy kiss.  
###### 13
All [^b]God's people greet you.
###### 14
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 2 Corinthians 13:12 A traditional greeting in biblical times, much like today’s handshake and hug.
[^b]: 2 Corinthians 13:13 Lit *the saints*.

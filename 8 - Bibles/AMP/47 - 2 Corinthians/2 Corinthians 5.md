## The Temporal and Eternal
###### 1
For we know that if the earthly tent {our physical body} which is our house is torn down {through death}, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  
###### 2
For indeed in this *house* we groan, longing to be clothed with our {immortal, eternal} celestial dwelling,  
###### 3
so that by putting it on we will not be found naked.  
###### 4
For while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened {often weighed down, oppressed}, not that we want to be unclothed {separated by death from the body}, but to be clothed, so that what is mortal {the body} will be swallowed up by life {after the resurrection}.  
###### 5
Now He who has made us *and* prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the {Holy} Spirit as a pledge {a guarantee, a down payment on the fulfillment of His promise}.
###### 6
So then, being always filled with good courage *and* confident hope, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord--  
###### 7
for we walk by faith, not by sight {living our lives in a manner consistent with our confident belief in God's promises}--  
###### 8
we are {as I was saying} of good courage *and* confident hope, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.  
###### 9
Therefore, whether we are at home {on earth} or away from home {and with Him}, it is our {constant} ambition to be pleasing to Him.  
###### 10
For we {believers will be called to account and} must all appear before the [^a]judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be repaid for what has been done in the body, whether good or [^b]bad {that is, each will be held responsible for his actions, purposes, goals, motives--the use or misuse of his time, opportunities and abilities}.
###### 11
Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord {and understand the importance of obedience and worship}, we persuade people {to be reconciled to Him}. But we are plainly known to God {He knows everything about us}; and I hope that we are plainly known also in your consciences {your God-given discernment}.  
###### 12
We are not commending ourselves to you again, but are giving you an occasion to be {rightfully} proud of us, so that you will have *an answer* for those who take pride in {outward} appearances {the virtues they pretend to have} rather than what is {actually} in heart.  
###### 13
If we are out of our mind {just unstable fanatics as some critics say}, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for your benefit.  
###### 14
For the love of Christ controls *and* compels us, because we have concluded this, that One died for all, therefore all died;  
###### 15
and He died for all, so that all those who live would no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and was raised for their sake.
###### 16
So from now on we regard no one from a human point of view {according to worldly standards and values}. Though we have known Christ from a human point of view, now we no longer know Him *in this way*.  
###### 17
Therefore if anyone is in Christ {that is, grafted in, joined to Him by faith in Him as Savior}, *he is* a new creature {reborn and renewed by the Holy Spirit}; the old things {the previous moral and spiritual condition} have passed away. Behold, new things have come {because spiritual awakening brings a new life}.  
###### 18
But all *these* things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ {making us acceptable to Him} and gave us the ministry of reconciliation {so that by our example we might bring others to Him},  
###### 19
that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting people's sins against them {but canceling them}. And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation {that is, restoration to favor with God}.
###### 20
So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us; we {as Christ's representatives} plead with you on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God.  
###### 21
He made Christ who knew no sin to {judicially} be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we would become the righteousness of God {that is, we would be made acceptable to Him and placed in a right relationship with Him by His gracious lovingkindness}.

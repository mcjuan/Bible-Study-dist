## Their Ministry Commended
###### 1
Working together *with Him*, we strongly urge you not to receive God's grace in vain {by turning away from sound doctrine and His merciful kindness}.  
###### 2
For He says,
"At the acceptable time (the time of grace) I listened to you,  
And I helped you on the day of salvation."
Behold, now is "the acceptable time," behold, now is "the day of salvation"--
###### 3
we put no obstruction in anyone's path, so that the ministry will not be discredited,  
###### 4
but we commend ourselves in every way as servants of God: in great endurance, in sufferings, in hardships, in distresses,  
###### 5
in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in sleepless nights, in hunger,  
###### 6
in purity *and* sincerity, in knowledge *and* spiritual insight, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love,  
###### 7
in {speaking} the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand {like holding the sword to attack} and for the left {like holding the shield to defend},  
###### 8
amid glory and dishonor; by evil report and good report; *branded* as deceivers and yet {vindicated as} truthful;  
###### 9
as unknown {to the world}, yet well-known {by God and His people}; as dying, yet we live; as punished, yet not killed;  
###### 10
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
###### 11
We are speaking freely to you, Corinthians {we are keeping nothing back}, and our heart is opened wide.  
###### 12
There is no limit to our affection for you, but you are limited in your own affection {for us}.  
###### 13
Now in the same way as a fair exchange {for our love toward you}--I am speaking as {I would} to children--open wide {your hearts} *to us* also.
###### 14
Do not be unequally bound together with unbelievers {do not make mismatched alliances with them, inconsistent with your faith}. For what partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?  
###### 15
What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial (Satan)? Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?  
###### 16
What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said:
"I will dwell among them and walk among them;  
And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.  
###### 17
"So come out from among unbelievers and be separate," says the Lord,  
"And do not touch what is unclean;  
And I will graciously receive you *and* welcome you {with favor},  
###### 18
And I will be a Father to you,  
And you will be My sons and daughters,"  
Says the Lord Almighty.

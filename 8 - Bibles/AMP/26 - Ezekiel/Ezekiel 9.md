## The Vision of Slaughter
###### 1
Then {in my vision} I heard Him cry out with a thunderous voice, saying, "Approach now, executioners of the city, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand."  
###### 2
Behold, six men {angelic beings} came from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with his battle-axe in his hand; and among them was a [^a]certain man clothed in linen, with a scribe's writing case at his side. They entered and stood beside the bronze altar.
###### 3
Then the {[^b]Shekinah} glory *and* brilliance of the God of Israel (the cloud) [^c]went up from the cherubim on which it had rested, to {stand above} the threshold of the {Lord's} temple. And the LORD called to the man clothed with linen, who had the scribe's writing case at his side.  
###### 4
The LORD said to him, "Go through the midst of the city, throughout all of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh {in distress} and grieve over all the repulsive acts which are being committed in it."  
###### 5
But to the others I heard Him say, "Follow him {the man with the scribe's writing case} throughout the city and strike; do not let your eyes have pity and do not spare {anyone}.  
###### 6
Utterly slay old men, young men, maidens, little children, and women; but do not touch *or* go near anyone on whom is the mark. Begin at My sanctuary." So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple {who did not have the Lord's mark on their foreheads}.  
###### 7
And He said to the executioners, "Defile the temple and fill its courtyards with the dead. Go out!" So they went out and struck down *the people* in the city.  
###### 8
As they were executing them and I *alone* was left, I fell face downward and cried out, "Alas, Lord God! Will You destroy all that is left of Israel {the whole remnant} by pouring out Your wrath *and* indignation on Jerusalem?"
###### 9
Then He said to me, "The wickedness (guilt) of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of blood and the city is full of perversion *and* injustice; for they say, 'The LORD has abandoned the land; the LORD does not see {what we are doing}.'  
###### 10
But as for Me, My eye will have no pity, nor will I spare, but I will bring their {wicked} conduct upon their {own} heads."
###### 11
Then behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe's writing case at his side, reported, "I have done just as You have commanded me."

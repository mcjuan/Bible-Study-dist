## Dirge for the Princes of Israel
###### 1
"As for you, take up a dirge (funeral poem to be sung) for the princes of Israel  
###### 2
and say,
'What was your mother {Jerusalem and Judah}?  
A lioness among lions!  
She lay down among young lions,  
She reared her cubs.  
###### 3
'When she {the royal mother-city} brought up {Jehoahaz} one of her cubs,  
He became a {young} lion,  
And he learned to catch *and* tear the prey;  
He devoured men.  
###### 4
'The nations heard about him;  
He was captured in their pit,  
And they brought him with hooks  
To the land of Egypt.  
###### 5
'When she saw, as she waited,  
That her hope was lost,  
She took [^a]another of her cubs  
And made him a young lion.  
###### 6
'And he moved among the lions;  
He became a young lion,  
He learned to tear the prey;  
He devoured men.  
###### 7
'He destroyed their palaces  
And he flattened their cities;  
And the land and all who were in it were appalled  
By the sound of his roaring.  
###### 8
'Then the nations set against him (the king)  
On every side from the provinces,  
And they spread their net over him;  
He was captured in their pit.  
###### 9
'They put him in a cage with hooks *and* chains  
And brought him to the king of Babylon;  
They brought him in hunting nets  
So that his voice would be heard no more  
On the mountains of Israel.  
###### 10
'Your mother {Jerusalem} was like a vine in your [^b]vineyard,  
Planted by the waters;  
It was fruitful and full of branches  
Because of abundant water.  
###### 11
'And it had strong branches for the scepters of rulers,  
And its height was raised above the thick branches *and* into the clouds  
So that it was seen {easily} in its height with the mass of its branches.  
###### 12
'But the vine was uprooted in {godly} wrath {by His representative}  
And it was thrown down to the ground;  
The east wind dried up its fruit.  
Its strong branch was broken off  
So that it withered;  
The fire {of God's judgment} consumed it.  
###### 13
'And now it is transplanted in the wilderness,  
In a dry and thirsty land {of Babylon}.  
###### 14
'And the fire {of Zedekiah's rebellion} has gone out from its branch;  
It has consumed the vine's shoots and fruit,  
So that it has in it no {longer a} strong branch  
As a scepter to rule.'"
This is a dirge (funeral poem to be sung), and has become a dirge.

### Footnotes

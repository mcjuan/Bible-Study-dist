## Dirge for Egypt
###### 1
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,  
###### 2
"Son of man, prophesy and say, 'Thus says the Lord God,
"Wail, 'Alas for the day!'  
###### 3
"For the day is near,  
Even the day of the LORD is near,  
It will be a cloudy day;  
A time *of doom* for the nations.  
###### 4
"A sword will come upon Egypt,  
And anguish *and* trembling will be in Ethiopia (Cush),  
When the slain fall in Egypt  
And they {of Babylon} carry away her great mass of people *and* her riches  
And her foundations are torn down.
###### 5
Ethiopia (Cush), Put, Lud, all [^a]Arabia, Libya (Cub) and the people of the land of the covenant {the Jews who had taken refuge in Egypt} will fall with the Egyptians by the sword."
###### 6
'Thus says the LORD,  
"Those who uphold *and* support Egypt will fall  
And the pride of her power will come down;  
From Migdol {in the north} to Syene {in the south}  
They will fall within her by the sword,"  
Says the Lord God.  
###### 7
"And they will be desolate  
In the midst of countries that are desolated;  
And her cities will be  
Among cities that are devastated {by plunder and slavery}.  
###### 8
"And they will know {without any doubt} that I am the LORD,  
When I have set a fire in Egypt  
And all her helpers are shattered *and* destroyed.
###### 9
On that day {swift} messengers will go from Me in ships to frighten the careless *and* unsuspecting Ethiopians, and there will be anguish *and* trembling in them as in the day of {judgment for} Egypt; for behold, it is coming!"
###### 10
'Thus says the Lord God,
"I will also make the great people of Egypt cease  
By the hand of [^b]Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.  
###### 11
"He and his people with him,  
The most violent *and* ruthless of the nations,  
Will be brought in to destroy the land,  
And they will draw their swords against Egypt  
And fill the land with the slain.  
###### 12
"And I will make the rivers {of the Nile delta} dry  
And sell the land into the hands of evil men;  
I will make the land desolate  
And all that is in it,  
By the hand of strangers. I the LORD have spoken."
###### 13
'Thus says the Lord God,  
"I will also destroy the idols  
And I will put an end to the images in Memphis;  
There will no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt.  
And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.  
###### 14
"I will make Pathros desolate,  
Set fire to Zoan  
And execute judgments *and* punishments on Thebes.  
###### 15
"I will pour out My wrath on Pelusium,  
The stronghold of Egypt,  
And I will cut off (destroy) the population of Thebes.  
###### 16
"I will set fire to Egypt;  
Pelusium will writhe in {great} anguish,  
Thebes shall be torn open  
And Memphis shall be in daily distress.  
###### 17
"The young men of On (Aven) and of Pi-beseth  
Will fall by the sword,  
And the women {and children} will go into captivity.  
###### 18
"In Tehaphnehes the day will be dark  
When I break the yoke bars *and* dominion of Egypt there.  
Then the pride of her power will come to an end;  
A cloud {of disasters} will cover her,  
And her daughters will go into captivity.  
###### 19
"In this way I will bring judgment *and* punishment on Egypt.  
Then they shall know {without any doubt} that I am the LORD."'"Victory for Babylon
###### 20
In the eleventh year {after King Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon}, in the first *month*, on the seventh of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
###### 21
"Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and behold, it has not been bound up to heal or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may be strong to hold *and* wield the sword.  
###### 22
Therefore thus says the Lord God, 'Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, both the strong one and the broken, and I will make the sword fall from his hand.  
###### 23
I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them throughout the lands.  
###### 24
I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; but I will break Pharaoh's arms and he will groan before him (Nebuchadnezzar) with the groanings of a {mortally} wounded man.  
###### 25
But I will strengthen *and* hold up the arms of the king of Babylon and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down. Then the people {of Egypt} will know that I am the LORD, when I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.  
###### 26
When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the lands, then they will know {without any doubt} that I am the LORD.'"

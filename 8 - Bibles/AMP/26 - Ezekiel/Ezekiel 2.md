## The Prophet's Call
###### 1
Then He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak to you."  
###### 2
Then as He spoke to me the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet; and I heard Him speaking to me.  
###### 3
And He said to me, "I am sending you, son of man, to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people {in both the north and the south} that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have sinned *and* revolted against Me to this very day.  
###### 4
I am sending you to them who are stubborn and obstinate children, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord [^a]God.'  
###### 5
As for them, whether they listen or refuse {to listen}--for they are a rebellious house--yet they will know *and* be fully aware of the fact that there has been a prophet among them.  
###### 6
And you, son of man, neither fear them nor fear their words; though briars and thorns are all around you and you sit among scorpions, neither fear their words nor be dismayed at their presence, for they are a rebellious house.  
###### 7
But you shall speak My words to them whether they will listen or refuse {to listen}, for they are {most} rebellious.
###### 8
"As for you, son of man, listen to what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and eat what I am giving you."  
###### 9
Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out toward me; and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.  
###### 10
And He spread it before me, and it was written on the front and on the back, and written on it were {words of} lamentation (funeral songs) and mourning and woe.

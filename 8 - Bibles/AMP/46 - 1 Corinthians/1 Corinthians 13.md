## The Excellence of Love
###### 1
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not [^a]love {for others growing out of God's love for me}, then I have become only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal {just an annoying distraction}.  
###### 2
And if I have *the gift of* prophecy {and speak a new message from God to the people}, and understand all mysteries, and {possess} all knowledge; and if I have all {sufficient} faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love {reaching out to others}, I am nothing.  
###### 3
If I give all my possessions to feed *the poor*, and if I surrender my body [^b]to be burned, but do not have love, it does me no good at all.
###### 4
Love endures with patience *and* serenity, love is kind *and* thoughtful, and is not jealous *or* envious; love does not brag and is not proud *or* arrogant.  
###### 5
It is not rude; it is not self-seeking, it is not provoked {nor overly sensitive and easily angered}; it does not take into account a wrong *endured*.  
###### 6
It does not rejoice at injustice, but rejoices with the truth {when right and truth prevail}.  
###### 7
Love bears all things {regardless of what comes}, believes all things {looking for the best in each one}, hopes all things {remaining steadfast during difficult times}, endures all things {without weakening}.
###### 8
Love never fails {it never fades nor ends}. But as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for the gift of special knowledge, it will pass away.  
###### 9
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part {for our knowledge is fragmentary and incomplete}.  
###### 10
But when that which is complete *and* perfect comes, that which is incomplete *and* partial will pass away.  
###### 11
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.  
###### 12
For now {in this time of imperfection} we see in a mirror dimly {a blurred reflection, a riddle, an enigma}, but then {when the time of perfection comes we will see reality} face to face. Now I know in part {just in fragments}, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known {by God}.  
###### 13
And now there remain: faith {abiding trust in God and His promises}, hope {confident expectation of eternal salvation}, love {unselfish love for others growing out of God's love for me}, these three {the choicest graces}; but the greatest of these is love.

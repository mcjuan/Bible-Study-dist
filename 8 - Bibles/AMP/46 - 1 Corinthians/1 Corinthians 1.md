## Appeal to Unity
###### 1
Paul, called as an apostle (special messenger, personally chosen representative) of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and our brother [^a]Sosthenes,
###### 2
To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified (set apart, made holy) in Christ Jesus, who are selected *and* called as saints (God's people), together with all those who in every place call on *and* honor the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their *Lord* and ours:
###### 3
Grace to you and peace {inner calm and spiritual well-being} from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
###### 4
I thank my God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,  
###### 5
so that in everything you were {exceedingly} enriched in Him, in all speech {empowered by the spiritual gifts} and in all knowledge {with insight into the faith}.  
###### 6
In this way our testimony about Christ was confirmed *and* established in you,  
###### 7
so that you are not lacking in any *spiritual* gift {which comes from the Holy Spirit}, as you eagerly wait {with confident trust} for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ {when He returns}.  
###### 8
And He will also confirm you to the end {keeping you strong and free of any accusation, so that you will be} blameless *and* beyond reproach in the day {of the return} of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
###### 9
God is faithful {He is reliable, trustworthy and ever true to His promise--He can be depended on}, and through Him you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
###### 10
But I urge you, believers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in full agreement in what you say, and that there be no divisions *or* factions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your way of thinking and in your judgment {about matters of the faith}.  
###### 11
For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by those of Chloe's *household*, that there are quarrels *and* factions among you.  
###### 12
Now I mean this, that each one of you says, "I am {a disciple} of Paul," or "I am {a disciple} of Apollos," or "I am {a disciple} of Cephas (Peter)," or "I am {a disciple} of Christ."  
###### 13
Has Christ been divided {into different parts}? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul? {Certainly not!}  
###### 14
I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,  
###### 15
so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name.  
###### 16
Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know if I baptized anyone else.  
###### 17
For Christ did not send me {as an apostle} to baptize, but {commissioned and empowered me} to preach the good news {of salvation}--not with clever *and* eloquent speech {as an orator}, so that the cross of Christ would not be [^b]made ineffective {deprived of its saving power}.

## The Wisdom of God
###### 18
For the message of the cross is foolishness {absurd and illogical} to those who are perishing *and* spiritually dead {because they reject it}, but to us who are being saved {by God's grace} it is {the manifestation of} the power of God.  
###### 19
For it is written *and* forever remains written,
"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise {the philosophy of the philosophers},  
And the cleverness of the clever {who do not know Me} I will nullify."
###### 20
Where is the wise man (philosopher)? Where is the scribe (scholar)? Where is the debater (logician, orator) of this age? Has God not exposed the foolishness of this world's wisdom?  
###### 21
For since the world through all its {earthly} wisdom failed to recognize God, God in His wisdom was well-pleased through the [^c]foolishness of the message preached {regarding salvation} to save those who believe {in Christ and welcome Him as Savior}.  
###### 22
For Jews demand signs (attesting miracles), and Greeks pursue {worldly} wisdom *and* philosophy,  
###### 23
but we preach Christ crucified, {a message which is} to Jews a stumbling block {that provokes their opposition}, and to Gentiles foolishness {just utter nonsense},  
###### 24
but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks (Gentiles), Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  
###### 25
{This is} because the foolishness of God {is not foolishness at all and} is wiser than men {far beyond human comprehension}, and the weakness of God is stronger than men {far beyond the limits of human effort}.
###### 26
Just look at your own calling, believers; not many {of you were considered} wise according to human standards, not many powerful *or* influential, not many of high *and* noble birth.  
###### 27
But God has selected {for His purpose} the foolish things of the world to shame the wise {revealing their ignorance}, and God has selected {for His purpose} the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong {revealing their frailty}.  
###### 28
God has selected {for His purpose} the insignificant (base) things of the world, and the things that are despised *and* treated with contempt, {even} the things that are nothing, so that He might reduce to nothing the things that are,  
###### 29
so that no one may {be able to} boast in the presence of God.  
###### 30
But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God {revealing His plan of salvation}, and righteousness {making us acceptable to God}, and sanctification {making us holy and setting us apart for God}, and redemption {providing our ransom from the penalty for sin},  
###### 31
so then, as it is written {in Scripture}, "He who boasts *and* glories, let him boast *and* glory in the Lord."

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 Corinthians 1:1 This man may have served as secretary to Paul to record his dictation, and may be the synagogue leader mentioned in Acts 18:17.
[^b]: 1 Corinthians 1:17 Paul may be referring to the danger that convincing people to become Christians by the use of clever rhetoric would result in false conversions (cf 2:5).
[^c]: 1 Corinthians 1:21 The straightforward message of salvation seemed foolish to unbelievers.

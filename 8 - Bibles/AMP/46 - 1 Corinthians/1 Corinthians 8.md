## Take Care with Your Liberty
###### 1
Now about food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge {concerning this}. Knowledge {alone} makes {people self-righteously} arrogant, but love {that unselfishly seeks the best for others} builds up *and* encourages others to grow {in wisdom}.  
###### 2
If anyone imagines that he knows *and* understands anything {of divine matters, without love}, he has not yet known as he ought to know.  
###### 3
But if anyone loves God {with awe-filled reverence, obedience and gratitude}, he is known by Him {as His very own and is greatly loved}.
###### 4
In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world {it has no real existence}, and that there is no God but one.  
###### 5
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,  
###### 6
yet for us there is but one God, the Father, [^a]who is the source of all things, and we *exist* for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things {that have been created}, and we {believers exist and have life and have been redeemed} through Him.
###### 7
However, not all {believers} have this knowledge. But some, being accustomed {throughout their lives} to {thinking of} the idol until now {as real and living}, still eat food [^b]as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and because their conscience is weak, it is defiled (guilty, ashamed).  
###### 8
Now food will not commend us to God *nor* bring us close to Him; we are no worse off if we do not eat, nor are we better if we do eat.  
###### 9
Only be careful that this liberty of yours {this power to choose} does not somehow become a stumbling block {that is, a temptation to sin} to the weak {in conscience}.  
###### 10
For if someone sees you, a person having [^c]knowledge, [^d]eating in an idol's temple, then if he is weak, will he not be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols {and violate his own convictions}?  
###### 11
For through your knowledge (spiritual maturity) this weak man is ruined {that is, he suffers in his spiritual life}, the brother for whom Christ died.  
###### 12
And when you sin against the brothers and sisters in this way and wound their weak conscience {by confusing them}, you sin against Christ.  
###### 13
Therefore, if {my eating a certain} food causes my brother to stumble (sin), I will not eat {such} meat ever again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.

### Footnotes
[^a]: 1 Corinthians 8:6 Lit *from whom are all things*.
[^b]: 1 Corinthians 8:7 In Paul’s viewpoint, meat sold at the market place (even if it had been used in idol worship) was permissible food because a pagan sacrifice was meaningless, and the meat itself could not be contaminated by any such ritual (cf Mark 7:19). Some who had accepted Christ worried that they were violating their new faith if they ate any meat without knowing its origin first-hand.
[^c]: 1 Corinthians 8:10 I.e. the knowledge that no harm can come from eating the meat, since in reality the sacrifice is meaningless (see note v 7).
[^d]: 1 Corinthians 8:10 Lit *reclining*, i.e. the position in which people dined.

## Instructions and Greetings
###### 1
Now concerning the money collected for {the relief of} the saints {in Jerusalem}, you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia *to do*.  
###### 2
On the first day of every week each one of you is to put something aside, in proportion to his prosperity, and save it so that no collections {will need to} be made when I come.  
###### 3
When I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters {of authorization} to take your gift {of charity and love} to Jerusalem;  
###### 4
and if it is fitting for me to go too, they will accompany me.
###### 5
I will visit you after I go through Macedonia, for I am only passing through Macedonia;  
###### 6
but it may be that I will stay with you {for a while}, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way to wherever I may go *afterward*.  
###### 7
For I do not wish to see you right now *just* in passing, but I hope to remain with you for some time {later on}, if the Lord permits.  
###### 8
But I will stay in Ephesus until [^a]Pentecost,  
###### 9
because a wide door for effective service has opened to me {in Ephesus, a very promising opportunity}, and there are many adversaries.
###### 10
If Timothy comes, see to it that {you put him at ease, so that} he has nothing to fear in regard to you, for he is {devotedly} doing the Lord's work, just as I am.  
###### 11
So allow no one to treat him with disdain {as if he were inconsequential}. But send him off {cordially, and speed him on his way} in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him {to come along} with the *other* brothers.
###### 12
As for our brother Apollos, I have strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. It was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.
###### 13
Be on guard; stand firm in your faith {in God, respecting His precepts and keeping your doctrine sound}. Act like {mature} men *and* be courageous; be strong.  
###### 14
Let everything you do be done in love {motivated and inspired by God's love for us}.
###### 15
Brothers and sisters, you know that *those of* the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves for ministry to [^b]God's people--now I urge you  
###### 16
to be subject to such leaders {treating them with courtesy and respect}, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors {for the benefit of yourselves and the church}.  
###### 17
I rejoice because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have arrived, for they have made up for your absence.  
###### 18
They have refreshed my spirit as well as yours. So fully acknowledge such men *and* deeply appreciate them.
###### 19
The churches of Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church {that meets} in their house, send you their warm greetings in the Lord.  
###### 20
All the believers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
###### 21
This greeting is in my own hand--Paul.  
###### 22
If anyone does not love the Lord {does not obey and respect and believe in Jesus Christ and His message}, he is to be accursed. Maranatha (O our Lord, come)!  
###### 23
The grace of our Lord Jesus {His unmerited favor, His spiritual blessing, His profound mercy} be with you.  
###### 24
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.

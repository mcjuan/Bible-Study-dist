## The Use of Spiritual Gifts
###### 1
Now about the spiritual *gifts* {the special endowments given by the Holy Spirit}, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed.  
###### 2
You know that when you were pagans, *you were* led off after speechless idols; however you were led off {whether by impulse or habit}.  
###### 3
Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the {power and influence of the} Spirit of God can say, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is {my} Lord," except by {the power and influence of} the Holy Spirit.
###### 4
Now there are {distinctive} varieties of *spiritual* gifts {special abilities given by the grace and extraordinary power of the Holy Spirit operating in believers}, but it is the same Spirit {who grants them and empowers believers}.  
###### 5
And there are {distinctive} varieties of ministries *and* service, but it is the same Lord {who is served}.  
###### 6
And there are {distinctive} ways of working {to accomplish things}, but it is the same God who produces all things in all *believers* {inspiring, energizing, and empowering them}.  
###### 7
But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit {the spiritual illumination and the enabling of the Holy Spirit} for the common good.  
###### 8
To one is given through the {Holy} Spirit {the power to speak} the message of wisdom, and to another {the power to express} the word of knowledge *and* understanding according to the same Spirit;  
###### 9
to another {wonder-working} faith {is given} by the same {Holy} Spirit, and to another the {extraordinary} gifts of healings by the one Spirit;  
###### 10
and to another the working of [^a]miracles, and to another prophecy {foretelling the future, speaking a new message from God to the people}, and to another discernment of spirits {the ability to distinguish sound, godly doctrine from the deceptive doctrine of man-made religions and cults}, to another *various* kinds of {unknown} tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.  
###### 11
All these things {the gifts, the achievements, the abilities, the empowering} are brought about by one and the same {Holy} Spirit, distributing to each one individually just as He chooses.
###### 12
For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form {only} one body, so [^b]it is with Christ.  
###### 13
For by one {Holy} Spirit we were all baptized into one body, {spiritually transformed--united together} whether Jews or Greeks (Gentiles), slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one {Holy} Spirit {since the same Holy Spirit fills each life}.
###### 14
For the {human} body does not consist of one part, but of many {limbs and organs}.  
###### 15
If the foot says, "Because I am not a hand, I am not *a part* of the body," is it not on the contrary still *a part* of the body?  
###### 16
If the ear says, "Because I am not an eye, I am not *a part* of the body," is it not on the contrary still *a part* of the body?  
###### 17
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole {body} were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?  
###### 18
But now {as things really are}, God has placed *and* arranged the parts in the body, each one of them, just as He willed *and* saw fit {with the best balance of function}.  
###### 19
If they all were a single *organ*, where would {the rest of} the body be?  
###### 20
But now {as things really are} there are many parts {different limbs and organs}, but a single body.  
###### 21
The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."  
###### 22
But quite the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are {absolutely} necessary;  
###### 23
and as for those *parts* of the body which we consider less honorable, these we treat with greater honor; and our less presentable parts are treated with greater modesty,  
###### 24
while our more presentable parts do not require it. But God has combined the {whole} body, giving greater honor to that part which lacks it,  
###### 25
so that there would be no division *or* discord in the body {that is, lack of adaptation of the parts to each other}, but that the parts may have the same concern for one another.  
###### 26
And if one member suffers, all the parts share the suffering; if one member is honored, all rejoice with it.
###### 27
Now you {collectively} are Christ's body, and individually {you are} members of it {each with his own special purpose and function}.  
###### 28
So God has appointed *and* placed in the church {for His own use}: first apostles {chosen by Christ}, second prophets {those who foretell the future, those who speak a new message from God to the people}, third teachers, then those who work miracles, then those with the gifts of healings, the helpers, the administrators, and speakers in *various* kinds of {unknown} tongues.  
###### 29
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?  
###### 30
Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?  
###### 31
But earnestly desire *and* strive for the greater gifts {if acquiring them is going to be your goal}.
And yet I will show you a still more excellent way {one of the choicest graces and the highest of them all: unselfish love}.

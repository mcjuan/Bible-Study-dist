###### 1
The burden[^h4853] of the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] for Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], which stretcheth[^h5186] forth the heavens[^h8064], and layeth the foundation[^h3245] of the earth[^h776], and formeth[^h3335] the spirit[^h7307] of man[^h120] within[^h7130] him.
###### 2
Behold, I will make[^h7760] Jerusalem[^h3389] a cup[^h5592] of trembling[^h7478] unto all the people[^h5971] round about[^h5439], when they shall be in the siege[^h4692] both against Judah[^h3063] and against Jerusalem[^h3389].  
###### 3
And in that day[^h3117] will I make[^h7760] Jerusalem[^h3389] a burdensome[^h4614] stone[^h68] for all people[^h5971]: all that burden[^h6006] themselves with it shall be cut in pieces[^h8295] [^h8295], though all the people[^h1471] of the earth[^h776] be gathered together[^h622] against it.
###### 4
In that day[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], I will smite[^h5221] every horse[^h5483] with astonishment[^h8541], and his rider[^h7392] with madness[^h7697]: and I will open[^h6491] mine eyes[^h5869] upon the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], and will smite[^h5221] every horse[^h5483] of the people[^h5971] with blindness[^h5788].
###### 5
And the governors[^h441] of Judah[^h3063] shall say[^h559] in their heart[^h3820], The inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] shall be my strength[^h556] in the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] their God[^h430]. 
###### 6
In that day[^h3117] will I make[^h7760] the governors[^h441] of Judah[^h3063] like an hearth[^h3595] of fire[^h784] among the wood[^h6086], and like a torch[^h3940] of fire[^h784] in a sheaf[^h5995]; and they shall devour[^h398] all the people[^h5971] round about[^h5439], on the right hand[^h3225] and on the left[^h8040]: and Jerusalem[^h3389] shall be inhabited[^h3427] again in her own place, even in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 7
The LORD[^h3068] also shall save[^h3467] the tents[^h168] of Judah[^h3063] first[^h7223], that the glory[^h8597] of the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] and the glory[^h8597] of the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] do not magnify[^h1431] themselves against Judah[^h3063].
###### 8
In that day[^h3117] shall the LORD[^h3068] defend[^h1598] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389]; and he that is feeble[^h3782] among them at that day[^h3117] shall be as David[^h1732]; and the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] shall be as God[^h430], as the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] them. 
###### 9
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that I will seek[^h1245] to destroy[^h8045] all the nations[^h1471] that come[^h935] against Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 10
And I will pour[^h8210] upon the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], the spirit[^h7307] of grace[^h2580] and of supplications[^h8469]: and they shall look[^h5027] upon me whom they have pierced[^h1856], and they shall mourn[^h4553] for him, as one mourneth[^h5594] for his only[^h3173] son, and shall be in bitterness[^h4843] for him, as one that is in bitterness[^h4843] for his firstborn[^h1060].
###### 11
In that day[^h3117] shall there be a great[^h1431] mourning[^h4553] in Jerusalem[^h3389], as the mourning[^h4553] of Hadadrimmon[^h1910] in the valley[^h1237] of Megiddon[^h4023].
###### 12
And the land[^h776] shall mourn[^h5594], every[^h4940] family[^h4940] apart[^h905]; the family[^h4940] of the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] apart, and their wives[^h802] apart; the family[^h4940] of the house[^h1004] of Nathan[^h5416] apart, and their wives[^h802] apart; 
###### 13
The family[^h4940] of the house[^h1004] of Levi[^h3878] apart, and their wives[^h802] apart; the family[^h4940] of Shimei[^h8097] apart, and their wives[^h802] apart; 
###### 14
All the families[^h4940] that remain[^h7604], every family[^h4940] apart, and their wives[^h802] apart.

###### 1
Ask[^h7592] ye of the LORD[^h3068] rain[^h4306] in the time[^h6256] of the latter rain[^h4456]; so the LORD[^h3068] shall make[^h6213] bright clouds[^h2385], and give[^h5414] them showers[^h1653] of rain[^h4306], to every one[^h376] grass[^h6212] in the field[^h7704]. 
###### 2
For the idols[^h8655] have spoken[^h1696] vanity[^h205], and the diviners[^h7080] have seen[^h2372] a lie[^h8267], and have told[^h1696] false[^h7723] dreams[^h2472]; they comfort[^h5162] in vain[^h1892]: therefore they went[^h5265] their way as a flock[^h6629], they were troubled[^h6031], because there was no shepherd[^h7462].  
###### 3
Mine anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against the shepherds[^h7462], and I punished[^h6485] the goats[^h6260]: for the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] hath visited[^h6485] his flock[^h5739] the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], and hath made[^h7760] them as his goodly[^h1935] horse[^h5483] in the battle[^h4421]. 
###### 4
Out of him came forth[^h3318] the corner[^h6438], out of him the nail[^h3489], out of him the battle[^h4421] bow[^h7198], out of him every oppressor[^h5065] together[^h3162].
###### 5
And they shall be as mighty[^h1368] men, which tread down[^h947] their enemies in the mire[^h2916] of the streets[^h2351] in the battle[^h4421]: and they shall fight[^h3898], because the LORD[^h3068] is with them, and the riders[^h7392] on horses[^h5483] shall be confounded[^h3001]. 
###### 6
And I will strengthen[^h1396] the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], and I will save[^h3467] the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130], and I will bring them again to place[^h3427] them; for I have mercy[^h7355] upon them: and they shall be as though[^h834] I had not cast them off[^h2186]: for I am the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], and will hear[^h6030] them.
###### 7
And they of Ephraim[^h669] shall be like a mighty[^h1368] man, and their heart[^h3820] shall rejoice[^h8055] as through wine[^h3196]: yea, their children[^h1121] shall see[^h7200] it, and be glad[^h8055]; their heart[^h3820] shall rejoice[^h1523] in the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
I will hiss[^h8319] for them, and gather[^h6908] them; for I have redeemed[^h6299] them: and they shall increase[^h7235] as they have increased[^h7235].
###### 9
And I will sow[^h2232] them among the people[^h5971]: and they shall remember[^h2142] me in far countries[^h4801]; and they shall live[^h2421] with their children[^h1121], and turn again[^h7725].
###### 10
I will bring them again[^h7725] also out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and gather[^h6908] them out of Assyria[^h804]; and I will bring[^h935] them into the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568] and Lebanon[^h3844]; and place shall not be found[^h4672] for them.
###### 11
And he shall pass through[^h5674] the sea[^h3220] with affliction[^h6869], and shall smite[^h5221] the waves[^h1530] in the sea[^h3220], and all the deeps[^h4688] of the river[^h2975] shall dry up[^h3001]: and the pride[^h1347] of Assyria[^h804] shall be brought down[^h3381], and the sceptre[^h7626] of Egypt[^h4714] shall depart away[^h5493].
###### 12
And I will strengthen[^h1396] them in the LORD[^h3068]; and they shall walk up and down[^h1980] in his name[^h8034], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].

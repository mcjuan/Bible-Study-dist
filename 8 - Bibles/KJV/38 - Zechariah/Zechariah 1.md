###### 1
In the eighth[^h8066] month[^h2320], in the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Darius[^h1867], came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Zechariah[^h2148], the son[^h1121] of Berechiah[^h1296], the son[^h1121] of Iddo[^h5714] the prophet[^h5030], saying[^h559],
###### 2
The LORD[^h3068] hath been sore[^h7110] displeased[^h7107] with your fathers[^h1]. 
###### 3
Therefore say[^h559] thou unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; Turn[^h7725] ye unto me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], and I will turn[^h7725] unto you, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 4
Be ye not as your fathers[^h1], unto whom the former[^h7223] prophets[^h5030] have cried[^h7121], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; Turn[^h7725] ye now from your evil[^h7451] ways[^h1870], and from your evil[^h7451] doings[^h4611]: but they did not hear[^h8085], nor hearken[^h7181] unto me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
Your fathers[^h1], where are they? and the prophets[^h5030], do they live[^h2421] for ever[^h5769]?
###### 6
But my words[^h1697] and my statutes[^h2706], which I commanded[^h6680] my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], did they not take hold[^h5381] of your fathers[^h1]? and they returned[^h7725] and said[^h559], Like as the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] thought[^h2161] to do[^h6213] unto us, according to our ways[^h1870], and according to our doings[^h4611], so hath he dealt[^h6213] with us. 
###### 7
Upon the four[^h702] and twentieth[^h6242] day[^h3117] of the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240] month[^h2320], which is the month[^h2320] Sebat[^h7627], in the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Darius[^h1867], came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Zechariah[^h2148], the son[^h1121] of Berechiah[^h1296], the son[^h1121] of Iddo[^h5714] the prophet[^h5030], saying[^h559],
###### 8
I saw[^h7200] by night[^h3915], and behold a man[^h376] riding[^h7392] upon a red[^h122] horse[^h5483], and he stood[^h5975] among the myrtle trees[^h1918] that were in the bottom[^h4699]; and behind[^h310] him were there red[^h122] horses[^h5483], speckled[^h8320], and white[^h3836]. 
###### 9
Then said[^h559] I, O my lord[^h113], what are these? And the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me said[^h559] unto me, I will shew[^h7200] thee what these be.
###### 10
And the man[^h376] that stood[^h5975] among the myrtle trees[^h1918] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], These are they whom the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] to walk[^h1980] to and fro through the earth[^h776].
###### 11
And they answered[^h6030] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] that stood[^h5975] among the myrtle trees[^h1918], and said[^h559], We have walked to and fro[^h1980] through the earth[^h776], and, behold, all the earth[^h776] sitteth still[^h3427], and is at rest[^h8252].
###### 12
Then the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], how long wilt thou not have mercy[^h7355] on Jerusalem[^h3389] and on the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], against which thou hast had indignation[^h2194] these threescore and ten[^h7657] years[^h8141]?
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me with good[^h2896] words[^h1697] and comfortable[^h5150] words[^h1697].
###### 14
So the angel[^h4397] that communed[^h1696] with me said[^h559] unto me, Cry[^h7121] thou, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; I am jealous[^h7065] for Jerusalem[^h3389] and for Zion[^h6726] with a great[^h1419] jealousy[^h7068].
###### 15
And I am very[^h1419] sore[^h7110] displeased[^h7107] with the heathen[^h1471] that are at ease[^h7600]: for I was but a little[^h4592] displeased[^h7107], and they helped[^h5826] forward the affliction[^h7451].
###### 16
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; I am returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389] with mercies[^h7356]: my house[^h1004] shall be built[^h1129] in it, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], and a line[^h6957] [^h6961] shall be stretched forth[^h5186] upon Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 17
Cry[^h7121] yet, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; My cities[^h5892] through prosperity[^h2896] shall yet be spread abroad[^h6327]; and the LORD[^h3068] shall yet comfort[^h5162] Zion[^h6726], and shall yet choose[^h977] Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 18
Then lifted I up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200], and behold four[^h702] horns[^h7161].
###### 19
And I said[^h559] unto the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me, What be these? And he answered[^h559] me, These are the horns[^h7161] which have scattered[^h2219] Judah[^h3063], Israel[^h3478], and Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] shewed[^h7200] me four[^h702] carpenters[^h2796].
###### 21
Then said[^h559] I, What come[^h935] these to do[^h6213]? And he spake[^h559], saying[^h559], These are the horns[^h7161] which have scattered[^h2219] Judah[^h3063], so that[^h6310] no man[^h376] did lift up[^h5375] his head[^h7218]: but these are come[^h935] to fray[^h2729] them, to cast out[^h3034] the horns[^h7161] of the Gentiles[^h1471], which lifted up[^h5375] their horn[^h7161] over the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063] to scatter[^h2219] it.

###### 1
Then I turned[^h7725], and lifted up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and behold a flying[^h5774] roll[^h4039].
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto me, What seest[^h7200] thou? And I answered[^h559], I see[^h7200] a flying[^h5774] roll[^h4039]; the length[^h753] thereof is twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] thereof ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520].
###### 3
Then said[^h559] he unto me, This is the curse[^h423] that goeth forth[^h3318] over the face[^h6440] of the whole earth[^h776]: for every one that stealeth[^h1589] shall be cut off[^h5352] as on this side according[^h3644] to it; and every one that sweareth[^h7650] shall be cut off[^h5352] as on that side according[^h3644] to it. 
###### 4
I will bring it forth[^h3318], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], and it shall enter[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the thief[^h1590], and into the house[^h1004] of him that sweareth[^h7650] falsely[^h8267] by my name[^h8034]: and it shall remain[^h3885] in the midst[^h8432] of his house[^h1004], and shall consume[^h3615] it with the timber[^h6086] thereof and the stones[^h68] thereof.
###### 5
Then the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me went forth[^h3318], and said[^h559] unto me, Lift up[^h5375] now thine eyes[^h5869], and see[^h7200] what is this that goeth forth[^h3318].
###### 6
And I said[^h559], What is it? And he said[^h559], This is an ephah[^h374] that goeth forth[^h3318]. He said[^h559] moreover, This is their resemblance[^h5869] through all the earth[^h776].
###### 7
And, behold, there was lifted up[^h5375] a talent[^h3603] of lead[^h5777]: and this is a[^h259] woman[^h802] that sitteth[^h3427] in the midst[^h8432] of the ephah[^h374]. 
###### 8
And he said[^h559], This is wickedness[^h7564]. And he cast[^h7993] it into the midst[^h8432] of the ephah[^h374]; and he cast[^h7993] the weight[^h68] of lead[^h5777] upon the mouth[^h6310] thereof.
###### 9
Then lifted I up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and, behold, there came out[^h3318] two[^h8147] women[^h802], and the wind[^h7307] was in their wings[^h3671]; for they had[^h2007] wings[^h3671] like the wings[^h3671] of a stork[^h2624]: and they lifted up[^h5375] the ephah[^h374] between the earth[^h776] and the heaven[^h8064].
###### 10
Then said[^h559] I to the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me, Whither do these bear[^h3212] the ephah[^h374]?
###### 11
And he said[^h559] unto me, To build[^h1129] it an house[^h1004] in the land[^h776] of Shinar[^h8152]: and it shall be established[^h3559], and set[^h3240] there upon her own base[^h4369].

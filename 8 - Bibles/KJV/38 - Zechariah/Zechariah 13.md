###### 1
In that day[^h3117] there shall be a fountain[^h4726] opened[^h6605] to the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] and to the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] for sin[^h2403] and for uncleanness[^h5079]. 
###### 2
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], that I will cut off[^h3772] the names[^h8034] of the idols[^h6091] out of the land[^h776], and they shall no more be remembered[^h2142]: and also I will cause the prophets[^h5030] and the unclean[^h2932] spirit[^h7307] to pass[^h5674] out of the land[^h776].
###### 3
And it shall come to pass, that when any[^h376] shall yet prophesy[^h5012], then his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517] that begat[^h3205] him shall say[^h559] unto him, Thou shalt not live[^h2421]; for thou speakest[^h1696] lies[^h8267] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]: and his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517] that begat[^h3205] him shall thrust[^h1856] him through when he prophesieth[^h5012].
###### 4
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that the prophets[^h5030] shall be ashamed[^h954] every one[^h376] of his vision[^h2384], when he hath prophesied[^h5012]; neither shall they wear[^h3847] a rough[^h8181] garment[^h155] to deceive[^h3584]:  
###### 5
But he shall say[^h559], I am no prophet[^h5030], I am an husbandman[^h376] [^h5647] [^h127]; for man[^h120] taught me to keep cattle[^h7069] from my youth[^h5271].
###### 6
And one shall say[^h559] unto him, What are these wounds[^h4347] in thine hands[^h3027]? Then he shall answer[^h559], Those with which I was wounded[^h5221] in the house[^h1004] of my friends[^h157].
###### 7
Awake[^h5782], O sword[^h2719], against my shepherd[^h7462], and against the man[^h1397] that is my fellow[^h5997], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]: smite[^h5221] the shepherd[^h7462], and the sheep[^h6629] shall be scattered[^h6327]: and I will turn[^h7725] mine hand[^h3027] upon the little ones[^h6819].
###### 8
And it shall come to pass, that in all the land[^h776], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], two[^h8147] parts[^h6310] therein shall be cut off[^h3772] and die[^h1478]; but the third[^h7992] shall be left[^h3498] therein.
###### 9
And I will bring[^h935] the third part[^h7992] through the fire[^h784], and will refine[^h6884] them as silver[^h3701] is refined[^h6884], and will try[^h974] them as gold[^h2091] is tried[^h974]: they shall call[^h7121] on my name[^h8034], and I will hear[^h6030] them: I will say[^h559], It is my people[^h5971]: and they shall say[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] is my God[^h430].

###### 1
And the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me came again[^h7725], and waked[^h5782] me, as a man[^h376] that is wakened[^h5782] out of his sleep[^h8142],
###### 2
And said[^h559] unto me, What seest[^h7200] thou? And I said[^h559], I have looked[^h7200], and behold a candlestick[^h4501] all of gold[^h2091], with a bowl[^h1531] upon the top[^h7218] of it, and his seven[^h7651] lamps[^h5216] thereon, and seven[^h7651] pipes[^h4166] to the seven[^h7651] lamps[^h5216], which are upon the top[^h7218] thereof:  
###### 3
And two[^h8147] olive trees[^h2132] by it, one[^h259] upon the right[^h3225] side of the bowl[^h1543], and the other[^h259] upon the left[^h8040] side thereof.
###### 4
So I answered[^h6030] and spake[^h559] to the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me, saying[^h559], What are these, my lord[^h113]?
###### 5
Then the angel[^h4397] that talked[^h1696] with me answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto me, Knowest[^h3045] thou not what these be? And I said[^h559], No, my lord[^h113].
###### 6
Then he answered[^h6030] and spake[^h559] unto me, saying[^h559], This is the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Zerubbabel[^h2216], saying[^h559], Not by might[^h2428], nor by power[^h3581], but by my spirit[^h7307], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 7
Who art thou, O great[^h1419] mountain[^h2022]? before[^h6440] Zerubbabel[^h2216] thou shalt become a plain[^h4334]: and he shall bring forth[^h3318] the headstone[^h68] [^h7222] thereof with shoutings[^h8663], crying, Grace[^h2580], grace[^h2580] unto it.
###### 8
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 9
The hands[^h3027] of Zerubbabel[^h2216] have laid the foundation[^h3245] of this house[^h1004]; his hands[^h3027] shall also finish[^h1214] it; and thou shalt know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] hath sent[^h7971] me unto you.
###### 10
For who hath despised[^h936] the day[^h3117] of small things[^h6996]? for they shall rejoice[^h8055], and shall see[^h7200] the plummet[^h68] [^h913] in the hand[^h3027] of Zerubbabel[^h2216] with those seven[^h7651]; they are the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], which run to and fro[^h7751] through the whole earth[^h776].  
###### 11
Then answered[^h6030] I, and said[^h559] unto him, What are these two[^h8147] olive trees[^h2132] upon the right[^h3225] side of the candlestick[^h4501] and upon the left[^h8040] side thereof?
###### 12
And I answered[^h6030] again[^h8145], and said[^h559] unto him, What be these two[^h8147] olive[^h2132] branches[^h7641] which through[^h3027] the two[^h8147] golden[^h2091] pipes[^h6804] empty[^h7324] the golden[^h2091] oil out of themselves?   
###### 13
And he answered[^h559] me and said[^h559], Knowest[^h3045] thou not what these be? And I said[^h559], No, my lord[^h113].
###### 14
Then said[^h559] he, These are the two[^h8147] anointed[^h3323] ones[^h1121], that stand[^h5975] by the Lord[^h113] of the whole earth[^h776]. 
###### 15
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.</J> And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

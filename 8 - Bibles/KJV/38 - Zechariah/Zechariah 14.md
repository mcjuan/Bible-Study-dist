###### 1
Behold, the day[^h3117] of the LORD[^h3068] cometh[^h935], and thy spoil[^h7998] shall be divided[^h2505] in the midst[^h7130] of thee.
###### 2
For I will gather[^h622] all nations[^h1471] against Jerusalem[^h3389] to battle[^h4421]; and the city[^h5892] shall be taken[^h3920], and the houses[^h1004] rifled[^h8155], and the women[^h802] ravished[^h7901] [^h7693]; and half[^h2677] of the city[^h5892] shall go forth[^h3318] into captivity[^h1473], and the residue[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] shall not be cut off[^h3772] from the city[^h5892].
###### 3
Then shall the LORD[^h3068] go forth[^h3318], and fight[^h3898] against those nations[^h1471], as when[^h3117] he fought[^h3898] in the day[^h3117] of battle[^h7128].
###### 4
And his feet[^h7272] shall stand[^h5975] in that day[^h3117] upon the mount[^h2022] of Olives[^h2132], which is before[^h6440] Jerusalem[^h3389] on the east[^h6924], and the mount[^h2022] of Olives[^h2132] shall cleave[^h1234] in the midst[^h2677] thereof toward the east[^h4217] and toward the west[^h3220], and there shall be a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] valley[^h1516]; and half[^h2677] of the mountain[^h2022] shall remove[^h4185] toward the north[^h6828], and half[^h2677] of it toward the south[^h5045].
###### 5
And ye shall flee[^h5127] to the valley[^h1516] of the mountains[^h2022]; for the valley[^h1516] of the mountains[^h2022] shall reach[^h5060] unto Azal[^h682]: yea, ye shall flee[^h5127], like as ye fled[^h5127] from before[^h6440] the earthquake[^h7494] in the days[^h3117] of Uzziah[^h5818] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]: and the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430] shall come[^h935], and all the saints[^h6918] with thee.  
###### 6
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that the light[^h216] shall not be clear[^h3368], nor dark[^h7087] [^h7087]:   
###### 7
But it shall be one[^h259] day[^h3117] which shall be known[^h3045] to the LORD[^h3068], not day[^h3117], nor night[^h3915]: but it shall come to pass, that at evening[^h6153] time[^h6256] it shall be light[^h216]. 
###### 8
And it shall be in that day[^h3117], that living[^h2416] waters[^h4325] shall go out[^h3318] from Jerusalem[^h3389]; half[^h2677] of them toward the former[^h6931] sea[^h3220], and half[^h2677] of them toward the hinder[^h314] sea[^h3220]: in summer[^h7019] and in winter[^h2779] shall it be. 
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] shall be king[^h4428] over all the earth[^h776]: in that day[^h3117] shall there be one[^h259] LORD[^h3068], and his name[^h8034] one[^h259].
###### 10
All the land[^h776] shall be turned[^h5437] as a plain[^h6160] from Geba[^h1387] to Rimmon[^h7417] south[^h5045] of Jerusalem[^h3389]: and it shall be lifted up[^h7213], and inhabited[^h3427] in her place, from Benjamin's[^h1144] gate[^h8179] unto the place[^h4725] of the first[^h7223] gate[^h8179], unto the corner[^h6434] gate[^h8179], and from the tower[^h4026] of Hananeel[^h2606] unto the king's[^h4428] winepresses[^h3342].  
###### 11
And men shall dwell[^h3427] in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction[^h2764]; but Jerusalem[^h3389] shall be safely[^h983] inhabited[^h3427]. 
###### 12
And this shall be the plague[^h4046] wherewith the LORD[^h3068] will smite[^h5062] all the people[^h5971] that have fought[^h6633] against Jerusalem[^h3389]; Their flesh[^h1320] shall consume away[^h4743] while they stand[^h5975] upon their feet[^h7272], and their eyes[^h5869] shall consume away[^h4743] in their holes[^h2356], and their tongue[^h3956] shall consume away[^h4743] in their mouth[^h6310].
###### 13
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that a great[^h7227] tumult[^h4103] from the LORD[^h3068] shall be among them; and they shall lay hold[^h2388] every one[^h376] on the hand[^h3027] of his neighbour[^h7453], and his hand[^h3027] shall rise up[^h5927] against the hand[^h3027] of his neighbour[^h7453].
###### 14
And Judah[^h3063] also shall fight[^h3898] at Jerusalem[^h3389]; and the wealth[^h2428] of all the heathen[^h1471] round about[^h5439] shall be gathered together[^h622], gold[^h2091], and silver[^h3701], and apparel[^h899], in great[^h3966] abundance[^h7230].  
###### 15
And so shall be the plague[^h4046] of the horse[^h5483], of the mule[^h6505], of the camel[^h1581], and of the ass[^h2543], and of all the beasts[^h929] that shall be in these[^h1992] tents[^h4264], as this plague[^h4046].
###### 16
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left[^h3498] of all the nations[^h1471] which came[^h935] against Jerusalem[^h3389] shall even go up[^h5927] from[^h1767] year[^h8141] to year[^h8141] to worship[^h7812] the King[^h4428], the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], and to keep[^h2287] the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521].
###### 17
And it shall be, that whoso will not come up[^h5927] of all the families[^h4940] of the earth[^h776] unto Jerusalem[^h3389] to worship[^h7812] the King[^h4428], the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], even upon them shall be no rain[^h1653].
###### 18
And if the family[^h4940] of Egypt[^h4714] go not up[^h5927], and come[^h935] not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague[^h4046], wherewith the LORD[^h3068] will smite[^h5062] the heathen[^h1471] that come not up[^h5927] to keep[^h2287] the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521]. 
###### 19
This shall be the punishment[^h2403] of Egypt[^h4714], and the punishment[^h2403] of all nations[^h1471] that come not up[^h5927] to keep[^h2287] the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521]. 
###### 20
In that day[^h3117] shall there be upon the bells[^h4698] of the horses[^h5483], HOLINESS[^h6944] UNTO THE LORD[^h3068]; and the pots[^h5518] in the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004] shall be like the bowls[^h4219] before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196]. 
###### 21
Yea, every pot[^h5518] in Jerusalem[^h3389] and in Judah[^h3063] shall be holiness[^h6944] unto the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]: and all they that sacrifice[^h2076] shall come[^h935] and take[^h3947] of them, and seethe[^h1310] therein: and in that day[^h3117] there shall be no more the Canaanite[^h3669] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].

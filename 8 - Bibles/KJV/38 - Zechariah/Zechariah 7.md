###### 1
And it came to pass in the fourth[^h702] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Darius[^h1867], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto Zechariah[^h2148] in the fourth[^h702] day of the ninth[^h8671] month[^h2320], even in Chisleu[^h3691];
###### 2
When they had sent[^h7971] unto the house[^h1004] of God[^h410] Sherezer[^h8272] and Regemmelech[^h7278], and their men[^h582], to pray[^h2470] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], 
###### 3
And to speak[^h559] unto the priests[^h3548] which were in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], and to the prophets[^h5030], saying[^h559], Should I weep[^h1058] in the fifth[^h2549] month[^h2320], separating[^h5144] myself, as I have done[^h6213] these so many years[^h8141]?
###### 4
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 5
Speak[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], and to the priests[^h3548], saying[^h559], When ye fasted[^h6684] and mourned[^h5594] in the fifth[^h2549] and seventh[^h7637] month, even those seventy[^h7657] years[^h8141], did ye at all[^h6684] fast[^h6684] unto me, even to me?
###### 6
And when ye did eat[^h398], and when ye did drink[^h8354], did not ye eat[^h398] for yourselves, and drink[^h8354] for yourselves? 
###### 7
Should ye not hear the words[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath cried[^h7121] by[^h3027] the former[^h7223] prophets[^h5030], when Jerusalem[^h3389] was inhabited[^h3427] and in prosperity[^h7961], and the cities[^h5892] thereof round about her[^h5439], when men inhabited[^h3427] the south[^h5045] and the plain[^h8219]?  
###### 8
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto Zechariah[^h2148], saying[^h559],
###### 9
Thus speaketh[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], saying[^h559], Execute[^h8199] true[^h571] judgment[^h4941], and shew[^h6213] mercy[^h2617] and compassions[^h7356] every man[^h376] to his brother[^h251]: 
###### 10
And oppress[^h6231] not the widow[^h490], nor the fatherless[^h3490], the stranger[^h1616], nor the poor[^h6041]; and let none of you imagine[^h2803] evil[^h7451] against[^h376] his brother[^h251] in your heart[^h3824].
###### 11
But they refused[^h3985] to hearken[^h7181], and pulled away[^h5414] [^h5637] the shoulder[^h3802], and stopped[^h3513] their ears[^h241], that they should not hear[^h8085].  
###### 12
Yea, they made[^h7760] their hearts[^h3820] as an adamant stone[^h8068], lest they should hear[^h8085] the law[^h8451], and the words[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] hath sent[^h7971] in his spirit[^h7307] by[^h3027] the former[^h7223] prophets[^h5030]: therefore came a great[^h1419] wrath[^h7110] from the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 13
Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried[^h7121], and they would not hear[^h8085]; so they cried[^h7121], and I would not hear[^h8085], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]:
###### 14
But I scattered them with a whirlwind[^h5590] among all the nations[^h1471] whom they knew[^h3045] not. Thus the land[^h776] was desolate[^h8074] after[^h310] them, that no man passed through[^h5674] nor returned[^h7725]: for they laid[^h7760] the pleasant[^h2532] land[^h776] desolate[^h8047].

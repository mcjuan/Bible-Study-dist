###### 1
In the twenty[^h6242] [^h8141] and seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of Jeroboam[^h3379] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] began Azariah[^h5838] son[^h1121] of Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] to reign[^h4427].
###### 2
Sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was he when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] two[^h8147] and fifty[^h2572] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Jecholiah[^h3203] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his father[^h1] Amaziah[^h558] had done[^h6213];
###### 4
Save that the high places[^h1116] were not removed[^h5493]: the people[^h5971] sacrificed[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] still on the high places[^h1116].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5060] the king[^h4428], so that he was a leper[^h6879] unto the day[^h3117] of his death[^h4194], and dwelt[^h3427] in a several[^h2669] house[^h1004]. And Jotham[^h3147] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121] was over the house[^h1004], judging[^h8199] the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776].
###### 6
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Azariah[^h5838], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 7
So Azariah[^h5838] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and they buried[^h6912] him with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Jotham[^h3147] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 8
In the thirty[^h7970] [^h8141] and eighth[^h8083] year[^h8141] of Azariah[^h5838] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] did Zachariah[^h2148] the son[^h1121] of Jeroboam[^h3379] reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111] six[^h8337] months[^h2320].
###### 9
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], as his fathers[^h1] had done[^h6213]: he departed[^h5493] not from the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 10
And Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Jabesh[^h3003] conspired[^h7194] against him, and smote[^h5221] him before[^h6905] the people[^h5971], and slew[^h4191] him, and reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 11
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Zachariah[^h2148], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 12
This was the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which he spake[^h1696] unto Jehu[^h3058], saying[^h559], Thy sons[^h1121] shall sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478] unto the fourth[^h7243] generation. And so it came to pass.
###### 13
Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Jabesh[^h3003] began to reign[^h4427] in the nine[^h8672] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of Uzziah[^h5818] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]; and he reigned[^h4427] a full[^h3117] month[^h3391] in Samaria[^h8111].  
###### 14
For Menahem[^h4505] the son[^h1121] of Gadi[^h1424] went up[^h5927] from Tirzah[^h8656], and came[^h935] to Samaria[^h8111], and smote[^h5221] Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Jabesh[^h3003] in Samaria[^h8111], and slew[^h4191] him, and reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 15
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Shallum[^h7967], and his conspiracy[^h7195] which he made[^h7194], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 16
Then Menahem[^h4505] smote[^h5221] Tiphsah[^h8607], and all that were therein, and the coasts[^h1366] thereof from Tirzah[^h8656]: because they opened[^h6605] not to him, therefore he smote[^h5221] it; and all the women therein that were with child[^h2030] he ripped up[^h1234].
###### 17
In the nine[^h8672] [^h8141] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of Azariah[^h5838] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Menahem[^h4505] the son[^h1121] of Gadi[^h1424] to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478], and reigned ten[^h6235] years[^h8141] in Samaria[^h8111].
###### 18
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he departed[^h5493] not all his days[^h3117] from the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 19
And Pul[^h6322] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] came[^h935] against the land[^h776]: and Menahem[^h4505] gave[^h5414] Pul[^h6322] a thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], that his hand[^h3027] might be with him to confirm[^h2388] the kingdom[^h4467] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 20
And Menahem[^h4505] exacted[^h3318] the money[^h3701] of Israel[^h3478], even of all the mighty men[^h1368] of wealth[^h2428], of each[^h259] man[^h376] fifty[^h2572] shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701], to give[^h5414] to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]. So the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] turned back[^h7725], and stayed[^h5975] not there in the land[^h776]. 
###### 21
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Menahem[^h4505], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 22
And Menahem[^h4505] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and Pekahiah[^h6494] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 23
In the fiftieth[^h2572] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Azariah[^h5838] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] Pekahiah[^h6494] the son[^h1121] of Menahem[^h4505] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111], and reigned two years[^h8141].
###### 24
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he departed[^h5493] not from the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 25
But Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425], a captain[^h7991] of his, conspired[^h7194] against him, and smote[^h5221] him in Samaria[^h8111], in the palace[^h759] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], with Argob[^h709] and Arieh[^h745], and with him fifty[^h2572] men[^h376] of the Gileadites[^h1121] [^h1569]: and he killed[^h4191] him, and reigned[^h4427] in his room.
###### 26
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Pekahiah[^h6494], and all that he did[^h6213], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 27
In the two[^h8147] [^h8141] and fiftieth[^h2572] year[^h8141] of Azariah[^h5838] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111], and reigned twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141].
###### 28
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he departed[^h5493] not from the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 29
In the days[^h3117] of Pekah[^h6492] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] Tiglathpileser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and took[^h3947] Ijon[^h5859], and Abelbethmaachah[^h62], and Janoah[^h3239], and Kedesh[^h6943], and Hazor[^h2674], and Gilead[^h1568], and Galilee[^h1551], all the land[^h776] of Naphtali[^h5321], and carried them captive[^h1540] to Assyria[^h804].
###### 30
And Hoshea[^h1954] the son[^h1121] of Elah[^h425] made[^h7194] a conspiracy[^h7195] against Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425], and smote[^h5221] him, and slew[^h4191] him, and reigned[^h4427] in his stead, in the twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of Jotham[^h3147] the son[^h1121] of Uzziah[^h5818].
###### 31
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Pekah[^h6492], and all that he did[^h6213], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 32
In the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] began Jotham[^h3147] the son[^h1121] of Uzziah[^h5818] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] to reign[^h4427].
###### 33
Five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was he when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Jerusha[^h3388], the daughter[^h1323] of Zadok[^h6659].
###### 34
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he did[^h6213] according to all that his father[^h1] Uzziah[^h5818] had done[^h6213].
###### 35
Howbeit the high places[^h1116] were not removed[^h5493]: the people[^h5971] sacrificed[^h2076] and burned incense[^h6999] still in the high places[^h1116]. He built[^h1129] the higher[^h5945] gate[^h8179] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 36
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jotham[^h3147], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 37
In those days[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] began[^h2490] to send[^h7971] against Judah[^h3063] Rezin[^h7526] the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], and Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425].

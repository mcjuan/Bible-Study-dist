###### 1
And Ahab[^h256] had seventy[^h7657] sons[^h1121] in Samaria[^h8111]. And Jehu[^h3058] wrote[^h3789] letters[^h5612], and sent[^h7971] to Samaria[^h8111], unto the rulers[^h8269] of Jezreel[^h3157], to the elders[^h2205], and to them that brought up[^h539] Ahab's[^h256] children, saying[^h559], 
###### 2
Now as soon as this letter[^h5612] cometh[^h935] to you, seeing your master's[^h113] sons[^h1121] are with you, and there are with you chariots[^h7393] and horses[^h5483], a fenced[^h4013] city[^h5892] also, and armour[^h5402];
###### 3
Look even out[^h7200] the best[^h2896] and meetest[^h3477] of your master's[^h113] sons[^h1121], and set[^h7760] him on his father's[^h1] throne[^h3678], and fight[^h3898] for your master's[^h113] house[^h1004].
###### 4
But they were exceedingly[^h3966] [^h3966] afraid[^h3372], and said[^h559], Behold, two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] stood[^h5975] not before[^h6440] him: how then shall we stand[^h5975]?
###### 5
And he that was over the house[^h1004], and he that was over the city[^h5892], the elders[^h2205] also, and the bringers up[^h539] of the children, sent[^h7971] to Jehu[^h3058], saying[^h559], We are thy servants[^h5650], and will do[^h6213] all that thou shalt bid[^h559] us; we will not make any[^h376] king[^h4427]: do[^h6213] thou that which is good[^h2896] in thine eyes[^h5869].
###### 6
Then he wrote[^h3789] a letter[^h5612] the second time[^h8145] to them, saying[^h559], If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken[^h8085] unto my voice[^h6963], take[^h3947] ye the heads[^h7218] of the men[^h582] your master's[^h113] sons[^h1121], and come[^h935] to me to Jezreel[^h3157] by to morrow[^h4279] this time[^h6256]. Now the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121], being seventy[^h7657] persons[^h376], were with the great men[^h1419] of the city[^h5892], which brought them up[^h1431]. 
###### 7
And it came to pass, when the letter[^h5612] came[^h935] to them, that they took[^h3947] the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121], and slew[^h7819] seventy[^h7657] persons[^h376], and put[^h7760] their heads[^h7218] in baskets[^h1731], and sent[^h7971] him them to Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 8
And there came[^h935] a messenger[^h4397], and told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], They have brought[^h935] the heads[^h7218] of the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121]. And he said[^h559], Lay[^h7760] ye them in two[^h8147] heaps[^h6652] at the entering in[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] until the morning[^h1242].
###### 9
And it came to pass in the morning[^h1242], that he went out[^h3318], and stood[^h5975], and said[^h559] to all the people[^h5971], Ye be righteous[^h6662]: behold, I conspired[^h7194] against my master[^h113], and slew[^h2026] him: but who slew[^h5221] all these?
###### 10
Know[^h3045] now[^h645] that there shall fall[^h5307] unto the earth[^h776] nothing of the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] concerning the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath done[^h6213] that which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] his servant[^h5650] Elijah[^h452]. 
###### 11
So Jehu[^h3058] slew[^h5221] all that remained[^h7604] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256] in Jezreel[^h3157], and all his great men[^h1419], and his kinsfolks[^h3045], and his priests[^h3548], until he left[^h7604] him none remaining[^h8300]. 
###### 12
And he arose[^h6965] and departed[^h935], and came[^h3212] to Samaria[^h8111]. And as he was at the shearing[^h7462] house[^h1004] [^h1044] in the way[^h1870], 
###### 13
Jehu[^h3058] met[^h4672] with the brethren[^h251] of Ahaziah[^h274] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and said[^h559], Who are ye? And they answered[^h559], We are the brethren[^h251] of Ahaziah[^h274]; and we go down[^h3381] to salute[^h7965] the children[^h1121] of the king[^h4428] and the children[^h1121] of the queen[^h1377].  
###### 14
And he said[^h559], Take[^h8610] them alive[^h2416]. And they took[^h8610] them alive[^h2416], and slew[^h7819] them at the pit[^h953] of the shearing house[^h1044], even two[^h8147] and forty[^h705] men[^h376]; neither left[^h7604] he any[^h376] of them.
###### 15
And when he was departed[^h3212] thence, he lighted[^h4672] on Jehonadab[^h3082] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394] coming to meet[^h7125] him: and he saluted[^h1288] him, and said[^h559] to him, Is[^h3426] thine heart[^h3824] right[^h3477], as my heart[^h3824] is with thy heart[^h3824]? And Jehonadab[^h3082] answered[^h559], It is[^h3426]. If it be, give[^h5414] me thine hand[^h3027]. And he gave[^h5414] him his hand[^h3027]; and he took him up[^h5927] to him into the chariot[^h4818].  
###### 16
And he said[^h559], Come[^h3212] with me, and see[^h7200] my zeal[^h7068] for the LORD[^h3068]. So they made him ride[^h7392] in his chariot[^h7393].
###### 17
And when he came[^h935] to Samaria[^h8111], he slew[^h5221] all that remained[^h7604] unto Ahab[^h256] in Samaria[^h8111], till he had destroyed[^h8045] him, according to the saying[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] to Elijah[^h452].
###### 18
And Jehu[^h3058] gathered[^h6908] all the people[^h5971] together[^h6908], and said[^h559] unto them, Ahab[^h256] served[^h5647] Baal[^h1168] a little[^h4592]; but Jehu[^h3058] shall serve[^h5647] him much[^h7235].
###### 19
Now therefore call[^h7121] unto me all the prophets[^h5030] of Baal[^h1168], all his servants[^h5647], and all his priests[^h3548]; let none[^h376] be wanting[^h6485]: for I have a great[^h1419] sacrifice[^h2077] to do to Baal[^h1168]; whosoever shall be wanting[^h6485], he shall not live[^h2421]. But Jehu[^h3058] did[^h6213] it in subtilty[^h6122], to the intent that he might destroy[^h6] the worshippers[^h5647] of Baal[^h1168].
###### 20
And Jehu[^h3058] said[^h559], Proclaim[^h6942] a solemn assembly[^h6116] for Baal[^h1168]. And they proclaimed[^h7121] it. 
###### 21
And Jehu[^h3058] sent[^h7971] through all Israel[^h3478]: and all the worshippers[^h5647] of Baal[^h1168] came[^h935], so that there was not a man[^h376] left[^h7604] that came[^h935] not. And they came[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168]; and the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168] was full[^h4390] from one end[^h6310] to another[^h6310]. 
###### 22
And he said[^h559] unto him that was over the vestry[^h4458], Bring forth[^h3318] vestments[^h3830] for all the worshippers[^h5647] of Baal[^h1168]. And he brought them forth[^h3318] vestments[^h4403].
###### 23
And Jehu[^h3058] went[^h935], and Jehonadab[^h3082] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394], into the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], and said[^h559] unto the worshippers[^h5647] of Baal[^h1168], Search[^h2664], and look[^h7200] that there be[^h3426] here with you none of the servants[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], but the worshippers[^h5647] of Baal[^h1168] only.
###### 24
And when they went in[^h935] to offer[^h6213] sacrifices[^h2077] and burnt offerings[^h5930], Jehu[^h3058] appointed[^h7760] fourscore[^h8084] men[^h376] without[^h2351], and said[^h559], If any[^h376] of the men[^h582] whom I have brought[^h935] into your hands[^h3027] escape[^h4422], he that letteth him go, his life[^h5315] shall be for the life[^h5315] of him.
###### 25
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end[^h3615] of offering[^h6213] the burnt offering[^h5930], that Jehu[^h3058] said[^h559] to the guard[^h7323] and to the captains[^h7991], Go in[^h935], and slay[^h5221] them; let none[^h376] come forth[^h3318]. And they smote[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; and the guard[^h7323] and the captains[^h7991] cast them out[^h7993], and went[^h3212] to the city[^h5892] of the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168]. 
###### 26
And they brought forth[^h3318] the images[^h4676] out of the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], and burned[^h8313] them. 
###### 27
And they brake down[^h5422] the image[^h4676] of Baal[^h1168], and brake down[^h5422] the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], and made[^h7760] it a draught house[^h4163] [^h4280] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 28
Thus Jehu[^h3058] destroyed[^h8045] Baal[^h1168] out of Israel[^h3478].
###### 29
Howbeit from the sins[^h2399] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398], Jehu[^h3058] departed[^h5493] not from after[^h310] them, to wit, the golden[^h2091] calves[^h5695] that were in Bethel[^h1008], and that were in Dan[^h1835].
###### 30
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Jehu[^h3058], Because thou hast done well[^h2895] in executing[^h6213] that which is right[^h3477] in mine eyes[^h5869], and hast done[^h6213] unto the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256] according to all that was in mine heart[^h3824], thy children[^h1121] of the fourth[^h7243] generation shall sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 31
But Jehu[^h3058] took no heed[^h8104] to walk[^h3212] in the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] with all his heart[^h3824]: for he departed[^h5493] not from the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379], which made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398]. 
###### 32
In those days[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] began[^h2490] to cut[^h7096] Israel[^h3478] short[^h7096]: and Hazael[^h2371] smote[^h5221] them in all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]; 
###### 33
From Jordan[^h3383] eastward[^h4217] [^h8121], all the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], the Gadites[^h1425], and the Reubenites[^h7206], and the Manassites[^h4520], from Aroer[^h6177], which is by the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769], even Gilead[^h1568] and Bashan[^h1316].  
###### 34
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehu[^h3058], and all that he did[^h6213], and all his might[^h1369], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 35
And Jehu[^h3058] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]: and they buried[^h6912] him in Samaria[^h8111]. And Jehoahaz[^h3059] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 36
And the time[^h3117] that Jehu[^h3058] reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111] was twenty[^h6242] and eight[^h8083] years[^h8141].

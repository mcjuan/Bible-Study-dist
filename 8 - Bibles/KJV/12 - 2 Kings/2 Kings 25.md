###### 1
And it came to pass in the ninth[^h8671] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], in the tenth[^h6224] month[^h2320], in the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], that Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came[^h935], he, and all his host[^h2428], against Jerusalem[^h3389], and pitched[^h2583] against it; and they built[^h1129] forts[^h1785] against it round about[^h5439].
###### 2
And the city[^h5892] was besieged[^h935] [^h4692] unto the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667].
###### 3
And on the ninth[^h8672] day of the fourth month[^h2320] the famine[^h7458] prevailed[^h2388] in the city[^h5892], and there was no bread[^h3899] for the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776].
###### 4
And the city[^h5892] was broken up[^h1234], and all the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] fled by night[^h3915] by the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] between two walls[^h2346], which is by the king's[^h4428] garden[^h1588]: (now the Chaldees[^h3778] were against the city[^h5892] round about[^h5439]:) and the king went[^h3212] the way[^h1870] toward the plain[^h6160].
###### 5
And the army[^h2428] of the Chaldees[^h3778] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] the king[^h4428], and overtook[^h5381] him in the plains[^h6160] of Jericho[^h3405]: and all his army[^h2428] were scattered[^h6327] from him.
###### 6
So they took[^h8610] the king[^h4428], and brought him up[^h5927] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] to Riblah[^h7247]; and they gave[^h1696] judgment[^h4941] upon him. 
###### 7
And they slew[^h7819] the sons[^h1121] of Zedekiah[^h6667] before his eyes[^h5869], and put out[^h5786] the eyes[^h5869] of Zedekiah[^h6667], and bound[^h631] him with fetters[^h5178] of brass[^h5178], and carried[^h935] him to Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 8
And in the fifth[^h2549] month[^h2320], on the seventh[^h7651] day of the month[^h2320], which is the nineteenth[^h8672] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], came[^h935] Nebuzaradan[^h5018], captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876], a servant[^h5650] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], unto Jerusalem[^h3389]: 
###### 9
And he burnt[^h8313] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and all the houses[^h1004] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and every great[^h1419] man's house[^h1004] burnt[^h8313] he with fire[^h784].
###### 10
And all the army[^h2428] of the Chaldees[^h3778], that were with the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876], brake down[^h5422] the walls[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] round about[^h5439].
###### 11
Now the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] that were left[^h7604] in the city[^h5892], and the fugitives[^h5307] that fell away[^h5307] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], with the remnant[^h3499] of the multitude[^h1995], did Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] carry away[^h1540]. 
###### 12
But the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] left[^h7604] of the poor[^h1803] of the land[^h776] to be vinedressers[^h3755] and husbandmen[^h3009] [^h1461].
###### 13
And the pillars[^h5982] of brass[^h5178] that were in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the bases[^h4350], and the brasen[^h5178] sea[^h3220] that was in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], did the Chaldees[^h3778] break in pieces[^h7665], and carried[^h5375] the brass[^h5178] of them to Babylon[^h894].
###### 14
And the pots[^h5518], and the shovels[^h3257], and the snuffers[^h4212], and the spoons[^h3709], and all the vessels[^h3627] of brass[^h5178] wherewith they ministered[^h8334], took they away[^h3947].
###### 15
And the firepans[^h4289], and the bowls[^h4219], and such things as were of gold[^h2091], in gold[^h2091], and of silver[^h3701], in silver[^h3701], the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took away[^h3947].
###### 16
The two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982], one[^h259] sea[^h3220], and the bases[^h4350] which Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; the brass[^h5178] of all these vessels[^h3627] was without[^h3808] weight[^h4948]. 
###### 17
The height[^h6967] of the one[^h259] pillar[^h5982] was eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] cubits[^h520], and the chapiter[^h3805] upon it was brass[^h5178]: and the height[^h6967] of the chapiter[^h3805] three[^h7969] cubits[^h520]; and the wreathen work[^h7639], and pomegranates[^h7416] upon the chapiter[^h3805] round about[^h5439], all of brass[^h5178]: and like unto these had the second[^h8145] pillar[^h5982] with wreathen work[^h7639].
###### 18
And the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took[^h3947] Seraiah[^h8304] the chief[^h7218] priest[^h3548], and Zephaniah[^h6846] the second[^h4932] priest[^h3548], and the three[^h7969] keepers[^h8104] of the door[^h5592]: 
###### 19
And out of the city[^h5892] he took[^h3947] an[^h259] officer[^h5631] that was set[^h6496] over the men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and five[^h2568] men[^h582] of them that were[^h7200] in the king's[^h4428] presence[^h6440], which were found[^h4672] in the city[^h5892], and the principal[^h8269] scribe[^h5608] of the host[^h6635], which mustered[^h6633] the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], and threescore[^h8346] men[^h376] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] that were found[^h4672] in the city[^h5892]:   
###### 20
And Nebuzaradan[^h5018] captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took[^h3947] these, and brought[^h3212] them to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] to Riblah[^h7247]:
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] smote[^h5221] them, and slew[^h4191] them at Riblah[^h7247] in the land[^h776] of Hamath[^h2574]. So Judah[^h3063] was carried away[^h1540] out of their land[^h127].
###### 22
And as for the people[^h5971] that remained[^h7604] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], whom Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had left[^h7604], even over them he made Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296], the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], ruler[^h6485].
###### 23
And when all the captains[^h8269] of the armies[^h2428], they and their men[^h582], heard[^h8085] that the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had made Gedaliah[^h1436] governor[^h6485], there came[^h935] to Gedaliah[^h1436] to Mizpah[^h4709], even Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], and Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Careah[^h7143], and Seraiah[^h8304] the son[^h1121] of Tanhumeth[^h8576] the Netophathite[^h5200], and Jaazaniah[^h2970] the son[^h1121] of a Maachathite[^h4602], they and their men[^h582].
###### 24
And Gedaliah[^h1436] sware[^h7650] to them, and to their men[^h582], and said[^h559] unto them, Fear[^h3372] not to be the servants[^h5650] of the Chaldees[^h3778]: dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776], and serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]; and it shall be well[^h3190] with you.
###### 25
But it came to pass in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320], that Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], the son[^h1121] of Elishama[^h476], of the seed[^h2233] royal[^h4410], came[^h935], and ten[^h6235] men[^h582] with him, and smote[^h5221] Gedaliah[^h1436], that he died[^h4191], and the Jews[^h3064] and the Chaldees[^h3778] that were with him at Mizpah[^h4709]. 
###### 26
And all the people[^h5971], both small[^h6996] and great[^h1419], and the captains[^h8269] of the armies[^h2428], arose[^h6965], and came[^h935] to Egypt[^h4714]: for they were afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] the Chaldees[^h3778].
###### 27
And it came to pass in the seven[^h7651] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of the captivity[^h1546] of Jehoiachin[^h3078] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month[^h2320], on the seven[^h7651] and twentieth[^h6242] day of the month[^h2320], that Evilmerodach[^h192] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] in the year[^h8141] that he began to reign[^h4427] did lift up[^h5375] the head[^h7218] of Jehoiachin[^h3078] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] out of prison[^h1004] [^h3608];
###### 28
And he spake[^h1696] kindly[^h2896] to him, and set[^h5414] his throne[^h3678] above the throne[^h3678] of the kings[^h4428] that were with him in Babylon[^h894]; 
###### 29
And changed[^h8132] his prison[^h3608] garments[^h899]: and he did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] continually[^h8548] before[^h6440] him all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].
###### 30
And his allowance[^h737] was a continual[^h8548] allowance[^h737] given[^h5414] him of the king[^h4428], a daily[^h3117] [^h3117] rate[^h1697] for every day[^h3117], all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].

###### 1
Josiah[^h2977] was eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] thirty[^h7970] and one[^h259] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Jedidah[^h3040], the daughter[^h1323] of Adaiah[^h5718] of Boscath[^h1218].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and walked[^h3212] in all the way[^h1870] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1], and turned not aside[^h5493] to the right hand[^h3225] or to the left[^h8040].
###### 3
And it came to pass in the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Josiah[^h2977], that the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] Shaphan[^h8227] the son[^h1121] of Azaliah[^h683], the son[^h1121] of Meshullam[^h4918], the scribe[^h5608], to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Go up[^h5927] to Hilkiah[^h2518] the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548], that he may sum[^h8552] the silver[^h3701] which is brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], which the keepers[^h8104] of the door[^h5592] have gathered[^h622] of the people[^h5971]: 
###### 5
And let them deliver[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of the doers[^h6213] of the work[^h4399], that have the oversight[^h6485] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and let them give[^h5414] it to the doers[^h6213] of the work[^h4399] which is in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], to repair[^h2388] the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004],
###### 6
Unto carpenters[^h2796], and builders[^h1129], and masons[^h1443], and to buy[^h7069] timber[^h6086] and hewn[^h4274] stone[^h68] to repair[^h2388] the house[^h1004].
###### 7
Howbeit there was no reckoning made[^h2803] with them of the money[^h3701] that was delivered[^h5414] into their hand[^h3027], because they dealt[^h6213] faithfully[^h530].
###### 8
And Hilkiah[^h2518] the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548] said[^h559] unto Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608], I have found[^h4672] the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And Hilkiah[^h2518] gave[^h5414] the book[^h5612] to Shaphan[^h8227], and he read[^h7121] it.
###### 9
And Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and brought[^h7725] the king[^h4428] word[^h1697] again[^h7725], and said[^h559], Thy servants[^h5650] have gathered[^h5413] the money[^h3701] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004], and have delivered[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of them that do[^h6213] the work[^h4399], that have the oversight[^h6485] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 10
And Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608] shewed[^h5046] the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548] hath delivered[^h5414] me a book[^h5612]. And Shaphan[^h8227] read[^h7121] it before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 11
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] had heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451], that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899].
###### 12
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548], and Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], and Achbor[^h5907] the son[^h1121] of Michaiah[^h4320], and Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608], and Asahiah[^h6222] a servant[^h5650] of the king's[^h4428], saying[^h559],
###### 13
Go[^h3212] ye, enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068] for me, and for the people[^h5971], and for all Judah[^h3063], concerning the words[^h1697] of this book[^h5612] that is found[^h4672]: for great[^h1419] is the wrath[^h2534] of the LORD[^h3068] that is kindled[^h3341] against us, because our fathers[^h1] have not hearkened[^h8085] unto the words[^h1697] of this book[^h5612], to do[^h6213] according unto all that which is written[^h3789] concerning us.
###### 14
So Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548], and Ahikam[^h296], and Achbor[^h5907], and Shaphan[^h8227], and Asahiah[^h6222], went[^h3212] unto Huldah[^h2468] the prophetess[^h5031], the wife[^h802] of Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Tikvah[^h8616], the son[^h1121] of Harhas[^h2745], keeper[^h8104] of the wardrobe[^h899]; (now she dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] in the college[^h4932];) and they communed[^h1696] with her.  
###### 15
And she said[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Tell[^h559] the man[^h376] that sent[^h7971] you to me,
###### 16
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon this place[^h4725], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof, even all the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] which the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] hath read[^h7121]:
###### 17
Because they have forsaken[^h5800] me, and have burned incense[^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], that they might provoke me to anger[^h3707] with all the works[^h4639] of their hands[^h3027]; therefore my wrath[^h2534] shall be kindled[^h3341] against this place[^h4725], and shall not be quenched[^h3518].
###### 18
But to the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] which sent[^h7971] you to enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068], thus shall ye say[^h559] to him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], As touching the words[^h1697] which thou hast heard[^h8085];
###### 19
Because thine heart[^h3824] was tender[^h7401], and thou hast humbled[^h3665] thyself before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], when thou heardest[^h8085] what I spake[^h1696] against this place[^h4725], and against the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof, that they should become a desolation[^h8047] and a curse[^h7045], and hast rent[^h7167] thy clothes[^h899], and wept[^h1058] before[^h6440] me; I also have heard[^h8085] thee, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
Behold therefore, I will gather[^h622] thee unto thy fathers[^h1], and thou shalt be gathered[^h622] into thy grave[^h6913] in peace[^h7965]; and thine eyes[^h5869] shall not see[^h7200] all the evil[^h7451] which I will bring[^h935] upon this place[^h4725]. And they brought[^h7725] the king[^h4428] word[^h1697] again[^h7725].

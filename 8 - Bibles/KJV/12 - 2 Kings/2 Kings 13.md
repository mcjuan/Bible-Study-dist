###### 1
In the three[^h7969] [^h8141] and twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of Joash[^h3101] the son[^h1121] of Ahaziah[^h274] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] Jehoahaz[^h3059] the son[^h1121] of Jehu[^h3058] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111], and reigned seventeen[^h7651] [^h6240] years[^h8141]. 
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and followed[^h3212] [^h310] the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], which made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398]; he departed[^h5493] not therefrom. 
###### 3
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478], and he delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], and into the hand[^h3027] of Benhadad[^h1130] the son[^h1121] of Hazael[^h2371], all their days[^h3117].
###### 4
And Jehoahaz[^h3059] besought[^h2470] the LORD[^h3068], and the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] unto[^h6440] him: for he saw[^h7200] the oppression[^h3906] of Israel[^h3478], because the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] oppressed[^h3905] them.
###### 5
(And the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] a saviour[^h3467], so that they went out[^h3318] from under the hand[^h3027] of the Syrians[^h758]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in their tents[^h168], as beforetime[^h8032] [^h8543]. 
###### 6
Nevertheless they departed[^h5493] not from the sins[^h2403] of the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379], who made Israel[^h3478] sin[^h2398], but walked[^h1980] therein: and there remained[^h5975] the grove[^h842] also in Samaria[^h8111].)  
###### 7
Neither did he leave[^h7604] of the people[^h5971] to Jehoahaz[^h3059] but fifty[^h2572] horsemen[^h6571], and ten[^h6235] chariots[^h7393], and ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h7273]; for the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] had destroyed[^h6] them, and had made[^h7760] them like the dust[^h6083] by threshing[^h1758].
###### 8
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoahaz[^h3059], and all that he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 9
And Jehoahaz[^h3059] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and they buried[^h6912] him in Samaria[^h8111]: and Joash[^h3101] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 10
In the thirty[^h7970] [^h8141] and seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Jehoash[^h3060] the son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111], and reigned sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141].
###### 11
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]; he departed[^h5493] not from all the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] sin[^h2398]: but he walked[^h1980] therein.
###### 12
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Joash[^h3101], and all that he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369] wherewith he fought[^h3898] against Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 13
And Joash[^h3101] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and Jeroboam[^h3379] sat[^h3427] upon his throne[^h3678]: and Joash[^h3101] was buried[^h6912] in Samaria[^h8111] with the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
Now Elisha[^h477] was fallen sick[^h2470] of his sickness[^h2483] whereof he died[^h4191]. And Joash[^h3101] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] came down[^h3381] unto him, and wept[^h1058] over his face[^h6440], and said[^h559], O my father[^h1], my father[^h1], the chariot[^h7393] of Israel[^h3478], and the horsemen[^h6571] thereof.
###### 15
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto him, Take[^h3947] bow[^h7198] and arrows[^h2671]. And he took[^h3947] unto him bow[^h7198] and arrows[^h2671].
###### 16
And he said[^h559] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Put[^h7392] thine hand[^h3027] upon the bow[^h7198]. And he put[^h7392] his hand[^h3027] upon it: and Elisha[^h477] put[^h7760] his hands[^h3027] upon the king's[^h4428] hands[^h3027]. 
###### 17
And he said[^h559], Open[^h6605] the window[^h2474] eastward[^h6924]. And he opened[^h6605] it. Then Elisha[^h477] said[^h559], Shoot[^h3384]. And he shot[^h3384]. And he said[^h559], The arrow[^h2671] of the LORD'S[^h3068] deliverance[^h8668], and the arrow[^h2671] of deliverance[^h8668] from Syria[^h758]: for thou shalt smite[^h5221] the Syrians[^h758] in Aphek[^h663], till thou have consumed[^h3615] them.
###### 18
And he said[^h559], Take[^h3947] the arrows[^h2671]. And he took[^h3947] them. And he said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Smite[^h5221] upon the ground[^h776]. And he smote[^h5221] thrice[^h7969] [^h6471], and stayed[^h5975].
###### 19
And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] was wroth[^h7107] with him, and said[^h559], Thou shouldest have smitten[^h5221] five[^h2568] or six[^h8337] times[^h6471]; then hadst thou smitten[^h5221] Syria[^h758] till thou hadst consumed[^h3615] it: whereas now thou shalt smite[^h5221] Syria[^h758] but thrice[^h7969] [^h6471].
###### 20
And Elisha[^h477] died[^h4191], and they buried[^h6912] him. And the bands[^h1416] of the Moabites[^h4124] invaded[^h935] the land[^h776] at the coming in[^h935] of the year[^h8141].
###### 21
And it came to pass, as they were burying[^h6912] a man[^h376], that, behold, they spied[^h7200] a band[^h1416] of men; and they cast[^h7993] the man[^h376] into the sepulchre[^h6913] of Elisha[^h477]: and when the man[^h376] was let down[^h3212], and touched[^h5060] the bones[^h6106] of Elisha[^h477], he revived[^h2421], and stood up[^h6965] on his feet[^h7272]. 
###### 22
But Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] oppressed[^h3905] Israel[^h3478] all the days[^h3117] of Jehoahaz[^h3059].
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] was gracious[^h2603] unto them, and had compassion[^h7355] on them, and had respect[^h6437] unto them, because of[^h4616] his covenant[^h1285] with Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Jacob[^h3290], and would[^h14] not destroy[^h7843] them, neither cast[^h7993] he them from his presence[^h6440] as yet[^h5704]. 
###### 24
So Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] died[^h4191]; and Benhadad[^h1130] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 25
And Jehoash[^h3060] the son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] took[^h3947] again[^h7725] out of the hand[^h3027] of Benhadad[^h1130] the son[^h1121] of Hazael[^h2371] the cities[^h5892], which he had taken[^h3947] out of the hand[^h3027] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] his father[^h1] by war[^h4421]. Three[^h7969] times[^h6471] did Joash[^h3101] beat[^h5221] him, and recovered[^h7725] the cities[^h5892] of Israel[^h3478].

###### 1
Manasseh[^h4519] was twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] fifty[^h2572] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Hephzibah[^h2657].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], after the abominations[^h8441] of the heathen[^h1471], whom the LORD[^h3068] cast out[^h3423] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
For he built up[^h1129] again[^h7725] the high places[^h1116] which Hezekiah[^h2396] his father[^h1] had destroyed[^h6]; and he reared up[^h6965] altars[^h4196] for Baal[^h1168], and made[^h6213] a grove[^h842], as did[^h6213] Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]; and worshipped[^h7812] all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], and served[^h5647] them.
###### 4
And he built[^h1129] altars[^h4196] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], of which the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], In Jerusalem[^h3389] will I put[^h7760] my name[^h8034].
###### 5
And he built[^h1129] altars[^h4196] for all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064] in the two[^h8147] courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And he made his son[^h1121] pass[^h5674] through the fire[^h784], and observed times[^h6049], and used enchantments[^h5172], and dealt[^h6213] with familiar spirits[^h178] and wizards[^h3049]: he wrought[^h6213] much[^h7235] wickedness[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], to provoke him to anger[^h3707].
###### 7
And he set[^h7760] a graven image[^h6459] of the grove[^h842] that he had made[^h6213] in the house[^h1004], of which the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], and to Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], In this house[^h1004], and in Jerusalem[^h3389], which I have chosen[^h977] out of all tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], will I put[^h7760] my name[^h8034] for ever[^h5769]:
###### 8
Neither will I make the feet[^h7272] of Israel[^h3478] move[^h5110] any more[^h3254] out of the land[^h127] which I gave[^h5414] their fathers[^h1]; only if they will observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] according to all that I have commanded[^h6680] them, and according to all the law[^h8451] that my servant[^h5650] Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] them.
###### 9
But they hearkened[^h8085] not: and Manasseh[^h4519] seduced[^h8582] them to do[^h6213] more evil[^h7451] than did the nations[^h1471] whom the LORD[^h3068] destroyed[^h8045] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] his servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], saying[^h559],
###### 11
Because Manasseh[^h4519] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] hath done[^h6213] these abominations[^h8441], and hath done wickedly[^h7489] above all that the Amorites[^h567] did[^h6213], which were before[^h6440] him, and hath made Judah[^h3063] also to sin[^h2398] with his idols[^h1544]:
###### 12
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Behold, I am bringing[^h935] such evil[^h7451] upon Jerusalem[^h3389] and Judah[^h3063], that whosoever heareth[^h8085] of it, both[^h8147] his ears[^h241] shall tingle[^h6750].
###### 13
And I will stretch[^h5186] over Jerusalem[^h3389] the line[^h6957] of Samaria[^h8111], and the plummet[^h4949] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: and I will wipe[^h4229] Jerusalem[^h3389] as a man wipeth[^h4229] a dish[^h6747], wiping[^h4229] it, and turning[^h2015] it upside down[^h6440]. 
###### 14
And I will forsake[^h5203] the remnant[^h7611] of mine inheritance[^h5159], and deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341]; and they shall become a prey[^h957] and a spoil[^h4933] to all their enemies[^h341];
###### 15
Because they have done[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in my sight[^h5869], and have provoked[^h4480] me to anger[^h3707], since the day[^h3117] their fathers[^h1] came forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714], even unto this day[^h3117].
###### 16
Moreover Manasseh[^h4519] shed[^h8210] innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] very[^h3966] much[^h7235], till he had filled[^h4390] Jerusalem[^h3389] from one end[^h6310] to another[^h6310]; beside his sin[^h2403] wherewith he made Judah[^h3063] to sin[^h2398], in doing[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 17
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Manasseh[^h4519], and all that he did[^h6213], and his sin[^h2403] that he sinned[^h2398], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 18
And Manasseh[^h4519] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in the garden[^h1588] of his own house[^h1004], in the garden[^h1588] of Uzza[^h5798]: and Amon[^h526] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 19
Amon[^h526] was twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] two[^h8147] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Meshullemeth[^h4922], the daughter[^h1323] of Haruz[^h2743] of Jotbah[^h3192].
###### 20
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], as his father[^h1] Manasseh[^h4519] did[^h6213].
###### 21
And he walked[^h3212] in all the way[^h1870] that his father[^h1] walked in[^h1980], and served[^h5647] the idols[^h1544] that his father[^h1] served[^h5647], and worshipped[^h7812] them:
###### 22
And he forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1], and walked[^h1980] not in the way[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
And the servants[^h5650] of Amon[^h526] conspired[^h7194] against him, and slew[^h4191] the king[^h4428] in his own house[^h1004].
###### 24
And the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] slew[^h5221] all them that had conspired[^h7194] against king[^h4428] Amon[^h526]; and the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] made Josiah[^h2977] his son[^h1121] king[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 25
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Amon[^h526] which he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 26
And he was buried[^h6912] in his sepulchre[^h6900] in the garden[^h1588] of Uzza[^h5798]: and Josiah[^h2977] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

###### 1
Now Jehoram[^h3088] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111] the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and reigned[^h4427] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And he wrought[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]; but not like his father[^h1], and like his mother[^h517]: for he put away[^h5493] the image[^h4676] of Baal[^h1168] that his father[^h1] had made[^h6213]. 
###### 3
Nevertheless he cleaved[^h1692] unto the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], which made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398]; he departed[^h5493] not therefrom.
###### 4
And Mesha[^h4338] king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] was a sheepmaster[^h5349], and rendered[^h7725] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] lambs[^h3733], and an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] rams[^h352], with the wool[^h6785].
###### 5
But it came to pass, when Ahab[^h256] was dead[^h4194], that the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] rebelled[^h6586] against the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
And king[^h4428] Jehoram[^h3088] went out[^h3318] of Samaria[^h8111] the same time[^h3117], and numbered[^h6485] all Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And he went[^h3212] and sent[^h7971] to Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], The king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] hath rebelled[^h6586] against me: wilt thou go[^h3212] with me against Moab[^h4124] to battle[^h4421]? And he said[^h559], I will go up[^h5927]: I am as thou art, my people[^h5971] as thy people[^h5971], and my horses[^h5483] as thy horses[^h5483].
###### 8
And he said[^h559], Which way[^h1870] shall we go up[^h5927]? And he answered[^h559], The way[^h1870] through the wilderness[^h4057] of Edom[^h123].
###### 9
So the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h3212], and the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123]: and they fetched a compass[^h5437] of seven[^h7651] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870]: and there was no water[^h4325] for the host[^h4264], and for the cattle[^h929] that followed[^h7272] them. 
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Alas[^h162]! that the LORD[^h3068] hath called[^h7121] these three[^h7969] kings[^h4428] together[^h7121], to deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Moab[^h4124]!
###### 11
But Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], Is there not here a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068], that we may enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068] by him? And one[^h259] of the king[^h4428] of Israel's[^h3478] servants[^h5650] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Here is Elisha[^h477] the son[^h1121] of Shaphat[^h8202], which poured[^h3332] water[^h4325] on the hands[^h3027] of Elijah[^h452].
###### 12
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] is[^h3426] with him. So the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] and the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123] went down[^h3381] to him.
###### 13
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], What have I to do with thee? get[^h3212] thee to the prophets[^h5030] of thy father[^h1], and to the prophets[^h5030] of thy mother[^h517]. And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto him, Nay: for the LORD[^h3068] hath called[^h7121] these three[^h7969] kings[^h4428] together[^h7121], to deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 14
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] liveth[^h2416], before[^h6440] whom I stand[^h5975], surely, were it not that[^h3884] I regard[^h5375] the presence[^h6440] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], I would not look[^h5027] toward thee, nor see[^h7200] thee.
###### 15
But now bring[^h3947] me a minstrel[^h5059]. And it came to pass, when the minstrel[^h5059] played[^h5059], that the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] came upon him.
###### 16
And he said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Make[^h6213] this valley[^h5158] full of ditches[^h1356].
###### 17
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Ye shall not see[^h7200] wind[^h7307], neither shall ye see[^h7200] rain[^h1653]; yet that valley[^h5158] shall be filled[^h4390] with water[^h4325], that ye may drink[^h8354], both ye, and your cattle[^h4735], and your beasts[^h929].
###### 18
And this is but a light thing[^h7043] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he will deliver[^h5414] the Moabites[^h4124] also into your hand[^h3027].
###### 19
And ye shall smite[^h5221] every fenced[^h4013] city[^h5892], and every choice[^h4004] city[^h5892], and shall fell[^h5307] every good[^h2896] tree[^h6086], and stop[^h5640] all wells[^h4599] of water[^h4325], and mar[^h3510] every good[^h2896] piece[^h2513] of land with stones[^h68]. 
###### 20
And it came to pass in the morning[^h1242], when the meat offering[^h4503] was offered[^h5927], that, behold, there came[^h935] water[^h4325] by the way[^h1870] of Edom[^h123], and the country[^h776] was filled[^h4390] with water[^h4325].
###### 21
And when all the Moabites[^h4124] heard[^h8085] that the kings[^h4428] were come up[^h5927] to fight[^h3898] against them, they gathered[^h6817] all that were able to put[^h2296] on armour[^h2290], and upward[^h4605], and stood[^h5975] in the border[^h1366].  
###### 22
And they rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and the sun[^h8121] shone[^h2224] upon the water[^h4325], and the Moabites[^h4124] saw[^h7200] the water[^h4325] on the other side[^h5048] as red[^h122] as blood[^h1818]:
###### 23
And they said[^h559], This is blood[^h1818]: the kings[^h4428] are surely[^h2717] slain[^h2717], and they have smitten[^h5221] one[^h376] another[^h7453]: now therefore, Moab[^h4124], to the spoil[^h7998]. 
###### 24
And when they came[^h935] to the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478], the Israelites[^h3478] rose up[^h6965] and smote[^h5221] the Moabites[^h4124], so that they fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] them: but they went forward[^h5221] smiting[^h5221] the Moabites[^h4124], even in their country. 
###### 25
And they beat down[^h2040] the cities[^h5892], and on every good[^h2896] piece[^h2513] of land cast[^h7993] every man[^h376] his stone[^h68], and filled[^h4390] it; and they stopped[^h5640] all the wells[^h4599] of water[^h4325], and felled[^h5307] all the good[^h2896] trees[^h6086]: only in Kirharaseth[^h7025] left[^h7604] they the stones[^h68] thereof; howbeit the slingers[^h7051] went about[^h5437] it, and smote[^h5221] it. 
###### 26
And when the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] saw[^h7200] that the battle[^h4421] was too sore[^h2388] for him, he took[^h3947] with him seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] swords[^h2719], to break through[^h1234] even unto the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123]: but they could[^h3201] not.
###### 27
Then he took[^h3947] his eldest[^h1060] son[^h1121] that should have reigned[^h4427] in his stead, and offered[^h5927] him for a burnt offering[^h5930] upon the wall[^h2346]. And there was great[^h1419] indignation[^h7110] against Israel[^h3478]: and they departed[^h5265] from him, and returned[^h7725] to their own land[^h776].

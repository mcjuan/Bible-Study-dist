###### 1
In those days[^h3117] was Hezekiah[^h2396] sick[^h2470] unto death[^h4191]. And the prophet[^h5030] Isaiah[^h3470] the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531] came[^h935] to him, and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Set thine house[^h1004] in order[^h6680]; for thou shalt die[^h4191], and not live[^h2421]. 
###### 2
Then he turned[^h5437] his face[^h6440] to the wall[^h7023], and prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 3
I beseech[^h577] thee, O LORD[^h3068], remember[^h2142] now how I have walked[^h1980] before[^h6440] thee in truth[^h571] and with a perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3824], and have done[^h6213] that which is good[^h2896] in thy sight[^h5869]. And Hezekiah[^h2396] wept[^h1058] [^h1065] sore[^h1419]. 
###### 4
And it came to pass, afore Isaiah[^h3470] was gone out[^h3318] into the middle[^h8484] court[^h2691] [^h5892], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to him, saying[^h559], 
###### 5
Turn again[^h7725], and tell[^h559] Hezekiah[^h2396] the captain[^h5057] of my people[^h5971], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of David[^h1732] thy father[^h1], I have heard[^h8085] thy prayer[^h8605], I have seen[^h7200] thy tears[^h1832]: behold, I will heal[^h7495] thee: on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117] thou shalt go up[^h5927] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And I will add[^h3254] unto thy days[^h3117] fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] years[^h8141]; and I will deliver[^h5337] thee and this city[^h5892] out of the hand[^h3709] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]; and I will defend[^h1598] this city[^h5892] for mine own sake, and for my servant[^h5650] David's[^h1732] sake.
###### 7
And Isaiah[^h3470] said[^h559], Take[^h3947] a lump[^h1690] of figs[^h8384]. And they took[^h3947] and laid[^h7760] it on the boil[^h7822], and he recovered[^h2421].
###### 8
And Hezekiah[^h2396] said[^h559] unto Isaiah[^h3470], What shall be the sign[^h226] that the LORD[^h3068] will heal[^h7495] me, and that I shall go up[^h5927] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] the third[^h7992] day[^h3117]?
###### 9
And Isaiah[^h3470] said[^h559], This sign[^h226] shalt thou have of the LORD[^h3068], that the LORD[^h3068] will do[^h6213] the thing[^h1697] that he hath spoken[^h1696]: shall the shadow[^h6738] go forward[^h1980] ten[^h6235] degrees[^h4609], or go back[^h7725] ten[^h6235] degrees[^h4609]?
###### 10
And Hezekiah[^h3169] answered[^h559], It is a light thing[^h7043] for the shadow[^h6738] to go down[^h5186] ten[^h6235] degrees[^h4609]: nay, but let the shadow[^h6738] return[^h7725] backward[^h322] ten[^h6235] degrees[^h4609].
###### 11
And Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030] cried[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and he brought[^h7725] the shadow[^h6738] ten[^h6235] degrees[^h4609] backward[^h322], by[^h4609] which it had gone down[^h3381] in the dial[^h4609] of Ahaz[^h271]. 
###### 12
At that time[^h6256] Berodachbaladan[^h1255], the son[^h1121] of Baladan[^h1081], king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] and a present[^h4503] unto Hezekiah[^h2396]: for he had heard[^h8085] that Hezekiah[^h2396] had been sick[^h2470]. 
###### 13
And Hezekiah[^h2396] hearkened[^h8085] unto them, and shewed[^h7200] them all the house[^h1004] of his precious things[^h5238], the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the spices[^h1314], and the precious[^h2896] ointment[^h8081], and all the house[^h1004] of his armour[^h3627], and all that was found[^h4672] in his treasures[^h214]: there was nothing[^h1697] in his house[^h1004], nor in all his dominion[^h4475], that Hezekiah[^h2396] shewed[^h7200] them not.  
###### 14
Then came[^h935] Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030] unto king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396], and said[^h559] unto him, What said[^h559] these men[^h582]? and from whence[^h370] came[^h935] they unto thee? And Hezekiah[^h2396] said[^h559], They are come[^h935] from a far[^h7350] country[^h776], even from Babylon[^h894].
###### 15
And he said[^h559], What have they seen[^h7200] in thine house[^h1004]? And Hezekiah[^h2396] answered[^h559], All the things that are in mine house[^h1004] have they seen[^h7200]: there is nothing[^h1697] among my treasures[^h214] that I have not shewed[^h7200] them.
###### 16
And Isaiah[^h3470] said[^h559] unto Hezekiah[^h2396], Hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], that all that is in thine house[^h1004], and that which thy fathers[^h1] have laid up in store[^h686] unto this day[^h3117], shall be carried[^h5375] into Babylon[^h894]: nothing[^h1697] shall be left[^h3498], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
And of thy sons[^h1121] that shall issue[^h3318] from thee, which thou shalt beget[^h3205], shall they take away[^h3947]; and they shall be eunuchs[^h5631] in the palace[^h1964] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 19
Then said[^h559] Hezekiah[^h2396] unto Isaiah[^h3470], Good[^h2896] is the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which thou hast spoken[^h1696]. And he said[^h559], Is it not good, if peace[^h7965] and truth[^h571] be in my days[^h3117]? 
###### 20
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Hezekiah[^h2396], and all his might[^h1369], and how he made[^h6213] a pool[^h1295], and a conduit[^h8585], and brought[^h935] water[^h4325] into the city[^h5892], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 21
And Hezekiah[^h2396] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]: and Manasseh[^h4519] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

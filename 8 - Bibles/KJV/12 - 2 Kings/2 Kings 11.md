###### 1
And when Athaliah[^h6271] the mother[^h517] of Ahaziah[^h274] saw[^h7200] that her son[^h1121] was dead[^h4191], she arose[^h6965] and destroyed[^h6] all the seed[^h2233] royal[^h4467]. 
###### 2
But Jehosheba[^h3089], the daughter[^h1323] of king[^h4428] Joram[^h3141], sister[^h269] of Ahaziah[^h274], took[^h3947] Joash[^h3101] the son[^h1121] of Ahaziah[^h274], and stole[^h1589] him from among[^h8432] the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] which were slain[^h4191]; and they hid[^h5641] him, even him and his nurse[^h3243], in the bedchamber[^h2315] [^h4296] from[^h6440] Athaliah[^h6271], so that he was not slain[^h4191].
###### 3
And he was with her hid[^h2244] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] six[^h8337] years[^h8141]. And Athaliah[^h6271] did reign[^h4427] over the land[^h776].
###### 4
And the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141] Jehoiada[^h3077] sent[^h7971] and fetched[^h3947] the rulers[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967], with the captains[^h3746] and the guard[^h7323], and brought[^h935] them to him into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with them, and took an oath[^h7650] of them in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and shewed[^h7200] them the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121].
###### 5
And he commanded[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], This is the thing[^h1697] that ye shall do[^h6213]; A third part[^h7992] of you that enter in[^h935] on the sabbath[^h7676] shall even be keepers[^h8104] of the watch[^h4931] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004];
###### 6
And a third part[^h7992] shall be at the gate[^h8179] of Sur[^h5495]; and a third part[^h7992] at the gate[^h8179] behind[^h310] the guard[^h7323]: so shall ye keep[^h8104] the watch[^h4931] of the house[^h1004], that it be not broken down[^h4535]. 
###### 7
And two[^h8147] parts[^h3027] of all you that go forth[^h3318] on the sabbath[^h7676], even they shall keep[^h8104] the watch[^h4931] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] about[^h413] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 8
And ye shall compass[^h5362] the king[^h4428] round about[^h5439], every man[^h376] with his weapons[^h3627] in his hand[^h3027]: and he that cometh[^h935] within the ranges[^h7713], let him be slain[^h4191]: and be ye with the king[^h4428] as he goeth out[^h3318] and as he cometh in[^h935].
###### 9
And the captains[^h8269] over the hundreds[^h3967] did[^h6213] according to all things that Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] commanded[^h6680]: and they took[^h3947] every man[^h376] his men[^h582] that were to come in[^h935] on the sabbath[^h7676], with them that should go out[^h3318] on the sabbath[^h7676], and came[^h935] to Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548].
###### 10
And to the captains[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967] did the priest[^h3548] give[^h5414] king[^h4428] David's[^h1732] spears[^h2595] and shields[^h7982], that were in the temple[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
And the guard[^h7323] stood[^h5975], every man[^h376] with his weapons[^h3627] in his hand[^h3027], round about[^h5439] the king[^h4428], from the right[^h3233] corner[^h3802] of the temple[^h1004] to the left[^h8042] corner[^h3802] of the temple[^h1004], along by the altar[^h4196] and the temple[^h1004]. 
###### 12
And he brought forth[^h3318] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121], and put[^h5414] the crown[^h5145] upon him, and gave him the testimony[^h5715]; and they made him king[^h4427], and anointed[^h4886] him; and they clapped[^h5221] their hands[^h3709], and said[^h559], God save[^h2421] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 13
And when Athaliah[^h6271] heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of the guard[^h7323] and of the people[^h5971], she came[^h935] to the people[^h5971] into the temple[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
And when she looked[^h7200], behold, the king[^h4428] stood[^h5975] by a pillar[^h5982], as the manner[^h4941] was, and the princes[^h8269] and the trumpeters[^h2689] by the king[^h4428], and all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] rejoiced[^h8056], and blew[^h8628] with trumpets[^h2689]: and Athaliah[^h6271] rent[^h7167] her clothes[^h899], and cried[^h7121], Treason[^h7195], Treason[^h7195].
###### 15
But Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] commanded[^h6680] the captains[^h8269] of the hundreds[^h3967], the officers[^h6485] of the host[^h2428], and said[^h559] unto them, Have her forth[^h3318] without[^h1004] the ranges[^h7713]: and him that followeth[^h935] [^h310] her kill[^h4191] with the sword[^h2719]. For the priest[^h3548] had said[^h559], Let her not be slain[^h4191] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And they laid[^h7760] hands[^h3027] on her; and she went[^h935] by the way[^h1870] by the which the horses[^h5483] came[^h3996] into the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]: and there was she slain[^h4191].
###### 17
And Jehoiada[^h3077] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] between the LORD[^h3068] and the king[^h4428] and the people[^h5971], that they should be the LORD'S[^h3068] people[^h5971]; between the king[^h4428] also and the people[^h5971].
###### 18
And all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], and brake it down[^h5422]; his altars[^h4196] and his images[^h6754] brake they in pieces[^h7665] thoroughly[^h3190], and slew[^h2026] Mattan[^h4977] the priest[^h3548] of Baal[^h1168] before[^h6440] the altars[^h4196]. And the priest[^h3548] appointed[^h7760] officers[^h6485] [^h6486] over the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 19
And he took[^h3947] the rulers[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967], and the captains[^h3746], and the guard[^h7323], and all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776]; and they brought down[^h3381] the king[^h4428] from the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and came[^h935] by the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] of the guard[^h7323] to the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]. And he sat[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of the kings[^h4428].
###### 20
And all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] rejoiced[^h8055], and the city[^h5892] was in quiet[^h8252]: and they slew[^h4191] Athaliah[^h6271] with the sword[^h2719] beside the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004].
###### 21
Seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was Jehoash[^h3060] when he began to reign[^h4427].

###### 1
In the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of Ahaz[^h271] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Hoshea[^h1954] the son[^h1121] of Elah[^h425] to reign[^h4427] in Samaria[^h8111] over Israel[^h3478] nine[^h8672] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], but not as the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] that were before[^h6440] him.
###### 3
Against him came up[^h5927] Shalmaneser[^h8022] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]; and Hoshea[^h1954] became his servant[^h5650], and gave[^h7725] him presents[^h4503].  
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] found[^h4672] conspiracy[^h7195] in Hoshea[^h1954]: for he had sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to So[^h5471] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and brought[^h5927] no present[^h4503] to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], as he had done year[^h8141] by year[^h8141]: therefore the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] shut him up[^h6113], and bound[^h631] him in prison[^h1004] [^h3608]. 
###### 5
Then the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] came up[^h5927] throughout all the land[^h776], and went up[^h5927] to Samaria[^h8111], and besieged[^h6696] it three[^h7969] years[^h8141].
###### 6
In the ninth[^h8671] year[^h8141] of Hoshea[^h1954] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] took[^h3920] Samaria[^h8111], and carried[^h1540] Israel[^h3478] away[^h1540] into Assyria[^h804], and placed[^h3427] them in Halah[^h2477] and in Habor[^h2249] by the river[^h5104] of Gozan[^h1470], and in the cities[^h5892] of the Medes[^h4074].
###### 7
For so it was, that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] had sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], which had brought them up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from under the hand[^h3027] of Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and had feared[^h3372] other[^h312] gods[^h430],
###### 8
And walked[^h3212] in the statutes[^h2708] of the heathen[^h1471], whom the LORD[^h3068] cast out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], which they had made[^h6213].
###### 9
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did secretly[^h2644] those things[^h1697] that were not right against the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], and they built[^h1129] them high places[^h1116] in all their cities[^h5892], from the tower[^h4026] of the watchmen[^h5341] to the fenced[^h4013] city[^h5892].
###### 10
And they set them up[^h5324] images[^h4676] and groves[^h842] in every high[^h1364] hill[^h1389], and under every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086]: 
###### 11
And there they burnt incense[^h6999] in all the high places[^h1116], as did the heathen[^h1471] whom the LORD[^h3068] carried away[^h1540] before[^h6440] them; and wrought[^h6213] wicked[^h7451] things[^h1697] to provoke the LORD[^h3068] to anger[^h3707]:
###### 12
For they served[^h5647] idols[^h1544], whereof the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h559] unto them, Ye shall not do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 13
Yet the LORD[^h3068] testified[^h5749] against Israel[^h3478], and against Judah[^h3063], by[^h3027] all the prophets[^h5030], and by all the seers[^h2374], saying[^h559], Turn[^h7725] ye from your evil[^h7451] ways[^h1870], and keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687] and my statutes[^h2708], according to all the law[^h8451] which I commanded[^h6680] your fathers[^h1], and which I sent[^h7971] to you by[^h3027] my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030]. 
###### 14
Notwithstanding they would not hear[^h8085], but hardened[^h7185] their necks[^h6203], like to the neck[^h6203] of their fathers[^h1], that did not believe[^h539] in the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].
###### 15
And they rejected[^h3988] his statutes[^h2706], and his covenant[^h1285] that he made[^h3772] with their fathers[^h1], and his testimonies[^h5715] which he testified[^h5749] against them; and they followed[^h3212] [^h310] vanity[^h1892], and became vain[^h1891], and went after[^h310] the heathen[^h1471] that were round about[^h5439] them, concerning whom the LORD[^h3068] had charged[^h6680] them, that they should not do[^h6213] like them.
###### 16
And they left[^h5800] all the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], and made[^h6213] them molten images[^h4541], even two[^h8147] calves[^h5695], and made[^h6213] a grove[^h842], and worshipped[^h7812] all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], and served[^h5647] Baal[^h1168].
###### 17
And they caused their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323] to pass[^h5674] through the fire[^h784], and used[^h7080] divination[^h7081] and enchantments[^h5172], and sold[^h4376] themselves to do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], to provoke him to anger[^h3707].
###### 18
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] was very[^h3966] angry[^h599] with Israel[^h3478], and removed[^h5493] them out of his sight[^h6440]: there was none left[^h7604] but the tribe[^h7626] of Judah[^h3063] only.
###### 19
Also Judah[^h3063] kept[^h8104] not the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], but walked[^h3212] in the statutes[^h2708] of Israel[^h3478] which they made[^h6213].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] rejected[^h3988] all the seed[^h2233] of Israel[^h3478], and afflicted[^h6031] them, and delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of spoilers[^h8154], until he had cast[^h7993] them out of his sight[^h6440].
###### 21
For he rent[^h7167] Israel[^h3478] from the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732]; and they made Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028] king[^h4427]: and Jeroboam[^h3379] drave[^h5080] [^h5077] Israel[^h3478] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], and made them sin[^h2398] a great[^h1419] sin[^h2401].
###### 22
For the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] walked[^h3212] in all the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] which he did[^h6213]; they departed[^h5493] not from them;
###### 23
Until the LORD[^h3068] removed[^h5493] Israel[^h3478] out of his sight[^h6440], as he had said[^h1696] by[^h3027] all his servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030]. So was Israel[^h3478] carried away[^h1540] out of their own land[^h127] to Assyria[^h804] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 24
And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] brought[^h935] men from Babylon[^h894], and from Cuthah[^h3575], and from Ava[^h5755], and from Hamath[^h2574], and from Sepharvaim[^h5617], and placed[^h3427] them in the cities[^h5892] of Samaria[^h8111] instead of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and they possessed[^h3423] Samaria[^h8111], and dwelt[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] thereof.
###### 25
And so it was at the beginning[^h8462] of their dwelling[^h3427] there, that they feared[^h3372] not the LORD[^h3068]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] lions[^h738] among them, which slew[^h2026] some of them.
###### 26
Wherefore they spake[^h559] to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], saying[^h559], The nations[^h1471] which thou hast removed[^h1540], and placed[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of Samaria[^h8111], know[^h3045] not the manner[^h4941] of the God[^h430] of the land[^h776]: therefore he hath sent[^h7971] lions[^h738] among them, and, behold, they slay[^h4191] them, because they know[^h3045] not the manner[^h4941] of the God[^h430] of the land[^h776].
###### 27
Then the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] commanded[^h6680], saying[^h559], Carry[^h3212] thither one[^h259] of the priests[^h3548] whom ye brought[^h1540] from thence; and let them go[^h3212] and dwell[^h3427] there, and let him teach[^h3384] them the manner[^h4941] of the God[^h430] of the land[^h776].
###### 28
Then one[^h259] of the priests[^h3548] whom they had carried away[^h1540] from Samaria[^h8111] came[^h935] and dwelt[^h3427] in Bethel[^h1008], and taught[^h3384] them how they should fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 29
Howbeit every nation[^h1471] made[^h6213] gods[^h430] of their own, and put[^h3240] them in the houses[^h1004] of the high places[^h1116] which the Samaritans[^h8118] had made[^h6213], every nation[^h1471] in their cities[^h5892] wherein they dwelt[^h3427].
###### 30
And the men[^h582] of Babylon[^h894] made[^h6213] Succothbenoth[^h5524], and the men[^h582] of Cuth[^h3575] made[^h6213] Nergal[^h5370], and the men[^h582] of Hamath[^h2574] made[^h6213] Ashima[^h807],
###### 31
And the Avites[^h5757] made[^h6213] Nibhaz[^h5026] and Tartak[^h8662], and the Sepharvites[^h5616] burnt[^h8313] their children[^h1121] in fire[^h784] to Adrammelech[^h152] and Anammelech[^h6048], the gods[^h430] of Sepharvaim[^h5617].
###### 32
So they feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], and made[^h6213] unto themselves of the lowest[^h7098] of them priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116], which sacrificed[^h6213] for them in the houses[^h1004] of the high places[^h1116].
###### 33
They feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] their own gods[^h430], after the manner[^h4941] of the nations[^h1471] whom they carried away[^h1540] from thence. 
###### 34
Unto this day[^h3117] they do[^h6213] after the former[^h7223] manners[^h4941]: they fear[^h3373] not the LORD[^h3068], neither do[^h6213] they after their statutes[^h2708], or after their ordinances[^h4941], or after the law[^h8451] and commandment[^h4687] which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290], whom he named[^h7760] [^h8034] Israel[^h3478];
###### 35
With whom the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285], and charged[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], Ye shall not fear[^h3372] other[^h312] gods[^h430], nor bow[^h7812] yourselves to them, nor serve[^h5647] them, nor sacrifice[^h2076] to them:
###### 36
But the LORD[^h3068], who brought you up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] with great[^h1419] power[^h3581] and a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220], him shall ye fear[^h3372], and him shall ye worship[^h7812], and to him shall ye do sacrifice[^h2076].
###### 37
And the statutes[^h2706], and the ordinances[^h4941], and the law[^h8451], and the commandment[^h4687], which he wrote[^h3789] for you, ye shall observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] for evermore[^h3117]; and ye shall not fear[^h3372] other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 38
And the covenant[^h1285] that I have made[^h3772] with you ye shall not forget[^h7911]; neither shall ye fear[^h3372] other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 39
But the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] ye shall fear[^h3372]; and he shall deliver[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of all your enemies[^h341].
###### 40
Howbeit they did not hearken[^h8085], but they did[^h6213] after their former[^h7223] manner[^h4941].
###### 41
So these nations[^h1471] feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] their graven images[^h6456], both their children[^h1121], and their children's[^h1121] children[^h1121]: as did[^h6213] their fathers[^h1], so do[^h6213] they unto this day[^h3117].

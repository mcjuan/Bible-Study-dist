###### 1
And it came to pass, when the LORD[^h3068] would take up[^h5927] Elijah[^h452] into heaven[^h8064] by a whirlwind[^h5591], that Elijah[^h452] went[^h3212] with Elisha[^h477] from Gilgal[^h1537].
###### 2
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto Elisha[^h477], Tarry[^h3427] here, I pray thee; for the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] me to Bethel[^h1008]. And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto him, As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], I will not leave[^h5800] thee. So they went down[^h3381] to Bethel[^h1008].
###### 3
And the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] that were at Bethel[^h1008] came forth[^h3318] to Elisha[^h477], and said[^h559] unto him, Knowest[^h3045] thou that the LORD[^h3068] will take away[^h3947] thy master[^h113] from thy head[^h7218] to day[^h3117]? And he said[^h559], Yea, I know[^h3045] it; hold ye your peace[^h2814].
###### 4
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto him, Elisha[^h477], tarry[^h3427] here, I pray thee; for the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] me to Jericho[^h3405]. And he said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], I will not leave[^h5800] thee. So they came[^h935] to Jericho[^h3405].
###### 5
And the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] that were at Jericho[^h3405] came[^h5066] to Elisha[^h477], and said[^h559] unto him, Knowest[^h3045] thou that the LORD[^h3068] will take away[^h3947] thy master[^h113] from thy head[^h7218] to day[^h3117]? And he answered[^h559], Yea, I know[^h3045] it; hold ye your peace[^h2814].
###### 6
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto him, Tarry[^h3427], I pray thee, here; for the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] me to Jordan[^h3383]. And he said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], I will not leave[^h5800] thee. And they two[^h8147] went on[^h3212].
###### 7
And fifty[^h2572] men[^h376] of the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] went[^h1980], and stood[^h5975] to view[^h5048] afar off[^h7350]: and they two[^h8147] stood[^h5975] by Jordan[^h3383]. 
###### 8
And Elijah[^h452] took[^h3947] his mantle[^h155], and wrapped it together[^h1563], and smote[^h5221] the waters[^h4325], and they were divided[^h2673] hither and thither, so that they two[^h8147] went over[^h5674] on dry[^h2724] ground.
###### 9
And it came to pass, when they were gone over[^h5674], that Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto Elisha[^h477], Ask[^h7592] what I shall do[^h6213] for thee, before I be taken away[^h3947] from thee. And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559], I pray thee, let a double[^h8147] portion[^h6310] of thy spirit[^h7307] be upon me.
###### 10
And he said[^h559], Thou hast asked[^h7592] a hard thing[^h7185]: nevertheless, if thou see[^h7200] me when I am taken[^h3947] from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so. 
###### 11
And it came to pass, as they still[^h1980] went on[^h1980], and talked[^h1696], that, behold, there appeared a chariot[^h7393] of fire[^h784], and horses[^h5483] of fire[^h784], and parted[^h6504] them both[^h8147] asunder[^h996]; and Elijah[^h452] went up[^h5927] by a whirlwind[^h5591] into heaven[^h8064].
###### 12
And Elisha[^h477] saw[^h7200] it, and he cried[^h6817], My father[^h1], my father[^h1], the chariot[^h7393] of Israel[^h3478], and the horsemen[^h6571] thereof. And he saw[^h7200] him no more: and he took hold[^h2388] of his own clothes[^h899], and rent[^h7167] them in two[^h8147] pieces[^h7168].
###### 13
He took up[^h7311] also the mantle[^h155] of Elijah[^h452] that fell[^h5307] from him, and went back[^h7725], and stood[^h5975] by the bank[^h8193] of Jordan[^h3383]; 
###### 14
And he took[^h3947] the mantle[^h155] of Elijah[^h452] that fell[^h5307] from him, and smote[^h5221] the waters[^h4325], and said[^h559], Where is the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Elijah[^h452]? and when he also had smitten[^h5221] the waters[^h4325], they parted[^h2673] hither and thither: and Elisha[^h477] went over[^h5674].
###### 15
And when the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] which were to view at Jericho[^h3405] saw[^h7200] him, they said[^h559], The spirit[^h7307] of Elijah[^h452] doth rest[^h5117] on Elisha[^h477]. And they came[^h935] to meet[^h7125] him, and bowed[^h7812] themselves to the ground[^h776] before him.
###### 16
And they said[^h559] unto him, Behold now, there be[^h3426] with thy servants[^h5650] fifty[^h2572] strong[^h2428] men[^h1121] [^h582]; let them go[^h3212], we pray thee, and seek[^h1245] thy master[^h113]: lest peradventure the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] hath taken him up[^h5375], and cast[^h7993] him upon some[^h259] mountain[^h2022], or into some[^h259] valley[^h1516]. And he said[^h559], Ye shall not send[^h7971].  
###### 17
And when they urged[^h6484] him till he was ashamed[^h954], he said[^h559], Send[^h7971]. They sent[^h7971] therefore fifty[^h2572] men[^h376]; and they sought[^h1245] three[^h7969] days[^h3117], but found[^h4672] him not.
###### 18
And when they came again[^h7725] to him, (for he tarried[^h3427] at Jericho[^h3405],) he said[^h559] unto them, Did I not say[^h559] unto you, Go[^h3212] not?
###### 19
And the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] said[^h559] unto Elisha[^h477], Behold, I pray thee, the situation[^h4186] of this city[^h5892] is pleasant[^h2896], as my lord[^h113] seeth[^h7200]: but the water[^h4325] is naught[^h7451], and the ground[^h776] barren[^h7921]. 
###### 20
And he said[^h559], Bring[^h3947] me a new[^h2319] cruse[^h6746], and put[^h7760] salt[^h4417] therein. And they brought[^h3947] it to him.
###### 21
And he went forth[^h3318] unto the spring[^h4161] of the waters[^h4325], and cast[^h7993] the salt[^h4417] in there, and said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], I have healed[^h7495] these waters[^h4325]; there shall not be from thence any more death[^h4194] or barren[^h7921] land.
###### 22
So the waters[^h4325] were healed[^h7495] unto this day[^h3117], according to the saying[^h1697] of Elisha[^h477] which he spake[^h1696].
###### 23
And he went up[^h5927] from thence unto Bethel[^h1008]: and as he was going up[^h5927] by the way[^h1870], there came forth[^h3318] little[^h6996] children[^h5288] out of the city[^h5892], and mocked[^h7046] him, and said[^h559] unto him, Go up[^h5927], thou bald head[^h7142]; go up[^h5927], thou bald head[^h7142].
###### 24
And he turned[^h6437] back[^h310], and looked[^h7200] on them, and cursed[^h7043] them in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]. And there came forth[^h3318] two[^h8147] she bears[^h1677] out of the wood[^h3293], and tare[^h1234] forty[^h705] and two[^h8147] children[^h3206] of them.
###### 25
And he went[^h3212] from thence to mount[^h2022] Carmel[^h3760], and from thence he returned[^h7725] to Samaria[^h8111].

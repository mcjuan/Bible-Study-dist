###### 1
In his days[^h3117] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came up[^h5927], and Jehoiakim[^h3079] became his servant[^h5650] three[^h7969] years[^h8141]: then he turned[^h7725] and rebelled[^h4775] against him.
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] against him bands[^h1416] of the Chaldees[^h3778], and bands[^h1416] of the Syrians[^h758], and bands[^h1416] of the Moabites[^h4124], and bands[^h1416] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and sent[^h7971] them against Judah[^h3063] to destroy[^h6] it, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] his servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030]. 
###### 3
Surely at the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] came this upon Judah[^h3063], to remove[^h5493] them out of his sight[^h6440], for the sins[^h2403] of Manasseh[^h4519], according to all that he did[^h6213];
###### 4
And also for the innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] that he shed[^h8210]: for he filled[^h4390] Jerusalem[^h3389] with innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818]; which the LORD[^h3068] would[^h14] not pardon[^h5545].
###### 5
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoiakim[^h3079], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 6
So Jehoiakim[^h3079] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]: and Jehoiachin[^h3078] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 7
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] came[^h3318] not again[^h3254] any more out of his land[^h776]: for the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had taken[^h3947] from the river[^h5158] of Egypt[^h4714] unto the river[^h5104] Euphrates[^h6578] all that pertained to the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 8
Jehoiachin[^h3078] was eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] three[^h7969] months[^h2320]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Nehushta[^h5179], the daughter[^h1323] of Elnathan[^h494] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 9
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his father[^h1] had done[^h6213].
###### 10
At that time[^h6256] the servants[^h5650] of Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came up[^h5927] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and the city[^h5892] was besieged[^h935] [^h4692]. 
###### 11
And Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came[^h935] against the city[^h5892], and his servants[^h5650] did besiege[^h6696] it.
###### 12
And Jehoiachin[^h3078] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went out[^h3318] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], he, and his mother[^h517], and his servants[^h5650], and his princes[^h8269], and his officers[^h5631]: and the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] took[^h3947] him in the eighth[^h8083] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427].  
###### 13
And he carried out[^h3318] thence all the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and cut in pieces[^h7112] all the vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091] which Solomon[^h8010] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] had made[^h6213] in the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696].
###### 14
And he carried away[^h1540] all Jerusalem[^h3389], and all the princes[^h8269], and all the mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], even ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] captives[^h1540], and all the craftsmen[^h2796] and smiths[^h4525]: none remained[^h7604], save[^h2108] the poorest sort[^h1803] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776].
###### 15
And he carried away[^h1540] Jehoiachin[^h3078] to Babylon[^h894], and the king's[^h4428] mother[^h517], and the king's[^h4428] wives[^h802], and his officers[^h5631], and the mighty[^h352] [^h193] of the land[^h776], those carried[^h3212] he into captivity[^h1473] from Jerusalem[^h3389] to Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 16
And all the men[^h582] of might[^h2428], even seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505], and craftsmen[^h2796] and smiths[^h4525] a thousand[^h505], all that were strong[^h1368] and apt[^h6213] for war[^h4421], even them the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] brought[^h935] captive[^h1473] to Babylon[^h894].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] made Mattaniah[^h4983] his father's brother[^h1730] king[^h4427] in his stead, and changed[^h5437] his name[^h8034] to Zedekiah[^h6667].
###### 18
Zedekiah[^h6667] was twenty[^h6242] and one[^h259] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] eleven[^h259] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Hamutal[^h2537], the daughter[^h1323] of Jeremiah[^h3414] of Libnah[^h3841].
###### 19
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that Jehoiakim[^h3079] had done[^h6213].
###### 20
For through the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] it came to pass in Jerusalem[^h3389] and Judah[^h3063], until he had cast them out[^h7993] from his presence[^h6440], that Zedekiah[^h6667] rebelled[^h4775] against the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894].

###### 1
In the seventeenth[^h7651] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425] Ahaz[^h271] the son[^h1121] of Jotham[^h3147] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began to reign[^h4427].
###### 2
Twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was Ahaz[^h271] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and did[^h6213] not that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], like David[^h1732] his father[^h1].
###### 3
But he walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], yea, and made his son[^h1121] to pass through[^h5674] the fire[^h784], according to the abominations[^h8441] of the heathen[^h1471], whom the LORD[^h3068] cast out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
And he sacrificed[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] in the high places[^h1116], and on the hills[^h1389], and under every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086].
###### 5
Then Rezin[^h7526] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] and Pekah[^h6492] son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] came up[^h5927] to Jerusalem[^h3389] to war[^h4421]: and they besieged[^h6696] Ahaz[^h271], but could[^h3201] not overcome[^h3898] him.
###### 6
At that time[^h6256] Rezin[^h7526] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] recovered[^h7725] Elath[^h359] to Syria[^h758] [^h130], and drave[^h5394] the Jews[^h3064] from Elath[^h359]: and the Syrians[^h726] came[^h935] to Elath[^h359], and dwelt[^h3427] there unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 7
So Ahaz[^h271] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to Tiglathpileser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], saying[^h559], I am thy servant[^h5650] and thy son[^h1121]: come up[^h5927], and save[^h3467] me out of the hand[^h3709] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], and out of the hand[^h3709] of the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], which rise up[^h6965] against me.
###### 8
And Ahaz[^h271] took[^h3947] the silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and sent[^h7971] it for a present[^h7810] to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804].
###### 9
And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] hearkened[^h8085] unto him: for the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] went up[^h5927] against Damascus[^h1834], and took[^h8610] it, and carried the people of it captive[^h1540] to Kir[^h7024], and slew[^h4191] Rezin[^h7526]. 
###### 10
And king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] went[^h3212] to Damascus[^h1834] to meet[^h7125] Tiglathpileser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and saw[^h7200] an altar[^h4196] that was at Damascus[^h1834]: and king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] sent[^h7971] to Urijah[^h223] the priest[^h3548] the fashion[^h1823] of the altar[^h4196], and the pattern[^h8403] of it, according to all the workmanship[^h4639] thereof. 
###### 11
And Urijah[^h223] the priest[^h3548] built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] according to all that king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] had sent[^h7971] from Damascus[^h1834]: so Urijah[^h223] the priest[^h3548] made[^h6213] it against king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] came[^h935] from Damascus[^h1834].
###### 12
And when the king[^h4428] was come[^h935] from Damascus[^h1834], the king[^h4428] saw[^h7200] the altar[^h4196]: and the king[^h4428] approached[^h7126] to the altar[^h4196], and offered[^h5927] thereon.
###### 13
And he burnt[^h6999] his burnt offering[^h5930] and his meat offering[^h4503], and poured[^h5258] his drink offering[^h5262], and sprinkled[^h2236] the blood[^h1818] of his peace offerings[^h8002], upon the altar[^h4196]. 
###### 14
And he brought[^h7126] also the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196], which was before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], from the forefront[^h6440] of the house[^h1004], from between the altar[^h4196] and the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and put[^h5414] it on the north[^h6828] side[^h3409] of the altar[^h4196].
###### 15
And king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] commanded[^h6680] Urijah[^h223] the priest[^h3548], saying[^h559], Upon the great[^h1419] altar[^h4196] burn[^h6999] the morning[^h1242] burnt offering[^h5930], and the evening[^h6153] meat offering[^h4503], and the king's[^h4428] burnt sacrifice[^h5930], and his meat offering[^h4503], with the burnt offering[^h5930] of all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], and their meat offering[^h4503], and their drink offerings[^h5262]; and sprinkle[^h2236] upon it all the blood[^h1818] of the burnt offering[^h5930], and all the blood[^h1818] of the sacrifice[^h2077]: and the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196] shall be for me to enquire[^h1239] by.
###### 16
Thus did[^h6213] Urijah[^h223] the priest[^h3548], according to all that king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] commanded[^h6680].
###### 17
And king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] cut off[^h7112] the borders[^h4526] of the bases[^h4350], and removed[^h5493] the laver[^h3595] from off them; and took down[^h3381] the sea[^h3220] from off the brasen[^h5178] oxen[^h1241] that were under it, and put[^h5414] it upon a pavement[^h4837] of stones[^h68].
###### 18
And the covert[^h4329] [^h4329] for the sabbath[^h7676] that they had built[^h1129] in the house[^h1004], and the king's[^h4428] entry[^h3996] without[^h2435], turned[^h5437] he from the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] for[^h6440] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804].
###### 19
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Ahaz[^h271] which he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 20
And Ahaz[^h271] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Hezekiah[^h2396] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

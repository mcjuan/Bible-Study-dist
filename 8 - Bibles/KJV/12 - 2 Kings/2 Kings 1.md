###### 1
Then Moab[^h4124] rebelled[^h6586] against Israel[^h3478] after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Ahab[^h256].
###### 2
And Ahaziah[^h274] fell down[^h5307] through a lattice[^h7639] in his upper chamber[^h5944] that was in Samaria[^h8111], and was sick[^h2470]: and he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397], and said[^h559] unto them, Go[^h3212], enquire[^h1875] of Baalzebub[^h1176] the god[^h430] of Ekron[^h6138] whether I shall recover[^h2421] of this disease[^h2483].
###### 3
But the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] to Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664], Arise[^h6965], go up[^h5927] to meet[^h7125] the messengers[^h4397] of the king[^h4428] of Samaria[^h8111], and say[^h1696] unto them, Is it not because there is not a God[^h430] in Israel[^h3478], that ye go[^h1980] to enquire[^h1875] of Baalzebub[^h1176] the god[^h430] of Ekron[^h6138]?
###### 4
Now therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Thou shalt not come down[^h3381] from that bed[^h4296] on which thou art gone up[^h5927], but shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]. And Elijah[^h452] departed[^h3212]. 
###### 5
And when the messengers[^h4397] turned back[^h7725] unto him, he said[^h559] unto them, Why are ye now[^h2088] turned back[^h7725]?
###### 6
And they said[^h559] unto him, There came[^h5927] a man[^h376] up[^h5927] to meet[^h7125] us, and said[^h559] unto us, Go[^h3212], turn again[^h7725] unto the king[^h4428] that sent[^h7971] you, and say[^h1696] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Is it not because there is not a God[^h430] in Israel[^h3478], that thou sendest[^h7971] to enquire[^h1875] of Baalzebub[^h1176] the god[^h430] of Ekron[^h6138]? therefore thou shalt not come down[^h3381] from that bed[^h4296] on which thou art gone up[^h5927], but shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191].
###### 7
And he said[^h1696] unto them, What manner[^h4941] of man[^h376] was he which came up[^h5927] to meet[^h7125] you, and told[^h1696] you these words[^h1697]? 
###### 8
And they answered[^h559] him, He was an hairy[^h8181] man[^h1167] [^h376], and girt[^h247] with a girdle[^h232] of leather[^h5785] about his loins[^h4975]. And he said[^h559], It is Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664].
###### 9
Then the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] unto him a captain[^h8269] of fifty[^h2572] with his fifty[^h2572]. And he went up[^h5927] to him: and, behold, he sat[^h3427] on the top[^h7218] of an hill[^h2022]. And he spake[^h1696] unto him, Thou man[^h376] of God[^h430], the king[^h4428] hath said[^h1696], Come down[^h3381].
###### 10
And Elijah[^h452] answered[^h6030] and said[^h1696] to the captain[^h8269] of fifty[^h2572], If I be a man[^h376] of God[^h430], then let fire[^h784] come down[^h3381] from heaven[^h8064], and consume[^h398] thee and thy fifty[^h2572]. And there came down[^h3381] fire[^h784] from heaven[^h8064], and consumed[^h398] him and his fifty[^h2572].
###### 11
Again[^h7725] also he sent[^h7971] unto him another[^h312] captain[^h8269] of fifty[^h2572] with his fifty[^h2572]. And he answered[^h6030] and said[^h1696] unto him, O man[^h376] of God[^h430], thus hath the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Come down[^h3381] quickly[^h4120].
###### 12
And Elijah[^h452] answered[^h6030] and said[^h1696] unto them, If I be a man[^h376] of God[^h430], let fire[^h784] come down[^h3381] from heaven[^h8064], and consume[^h398] thee and thy fifty[^h2572]. And the fire[^h784] of God[^h430] came down[^h3381] from heaven[^h8064], and consumed[^h398] him and his fifty[^h2572].
###### 13
And he sent[^h7971] again[^h7725] a captain[^h8269] of the third[^h7992] fifty[^h2572] with his fifty[^h2572]. And the third[^h7992] captain[^h8269] of fifty[^h2572] went up[^h5927], and came[^h935] and fell[^h3766] on his knees[^h1290] before[^h5048] Elijah[^h452], and besought[^h2603] him, and said[^h1696] unto him, O man[^h376] of God[^h430], I pray thee, let my life[^h5315], and the life[^h5315] of these fifty[^h2572] thy servants[^h5650], be precious[^h3365] in thy sight[^h5869]. 
###### 14
Behold, there came[^h3381] fire[^h784] down[^h3381] from heaven[^h8064], and burnt up[^h398] the two[^h8147] captains[^h8269] of the former[^h7223] fifties[^h2572] with their fifties[^h2572]: therefore let my life[^h5315] now be precious[^h3365] in thy sight[^h5869].
###### 15
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] unto Elijah[^h452], Go down[^h3381] with him: be not afraid[^h3372] of him[^h6440]. And he arose[^h6965], and went down[^h3381] with him unto the king[^h4428].
###### 16
And he said[^h1696] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Forasmuch as thou hast sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to enquire[^h1875] of Baalzebub[^h1176] the god[^h430] of Ekron[^h6138], is it not because there is no God[^h430] in Israel[^h3478] to enquire[^h1875] of his word[^h1697]? therefore thou shalt not come down[^h3381] off that bed[^h4296] on which thou art gone up[^h5927], but shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191].
###### 17
So he died[^h4191] according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which Elijah[^h452] had spoken[^h1696]. And Jehoram[^h3088] reigned[^h4427] in his stead in the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Jehoram[^h3088] the son[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]; because he had no son[^h1121].
###### 18
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Ahaziah[^h274] which he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?

###### 1
And the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971], and they gathered[^h622] unto him all the elders[^h2205] of Judah[^h3063] and of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
And the king[^h4428] went up[^h5927] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and all the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] and all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] with him, and the priests[^h3548], and the prophets[^h5030], and all the people[^h5971], both small[^h6996] and great[^h1419]: and he read[^h7121] in their ears[^h241] all the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] of the covenant[^h1285] which was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] stood[^h5975] by a pillar[^h5982], and made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to walk[^h3212] after[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687] and his testimonies[^h5715] and his statutes[^h2708] with all their heart[^h3820] and all their soul[^h5315], to perform[^h6965] the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285] that were written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612]. And all the people[^h5971] stood[^h5975] to the covenant[^h1285].
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Hilkiah[^h2518] the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548], and the priests[^h3548] of the second order[^h4932], and the keepers[^h8104] of the door[^h5592], to bring forth[^h3318] out of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068] all the vessels[^h3627] that were made[^h6213] for Baal[^h1168], and for the grove[^h842], and for all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064]: and he burned[^h8313] them without[^h2351] Jerusalem[^h3389] in the fields[^h7709] of Kidron[^h6939], and carried[^h5375] the ashes[^h6083] of them unto Bethel[^h1008].
###### 5
And he put down[^h7673] the idolatrous priests[^h3649], whom the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had ordained[^h5414] to burn incense[^h6999] in the high places[^h1116] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and in the places round about[^h4524] Jerusalem[^h3389]; them also that burned incense[^h6999] unto Baal[^h1168], to the sun[^h8121], and to the moon[^h3394], and to the planets[^h4208], and to all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064].   
###### 6
And he brought out[^h3318] the grove[^h842] from the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], without[^h2351] Jerusalem[^h3389], unto the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939], and burned[^h8313] it at the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939], and stamped it small[^h1854] to powder[^h6083], and cast[^h7993] the powder[^h6083] thereof upon the graves[^h6913] of the children[^h1121] of the people[^h5971].
###### 7
And he brake down[^h5422] the houses[^h1004] of the sodomites[^h6945], that were by the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], where the women[^h802] wove[^h707] hangings[^h1004] for the grove[^h842]. 
###### 8
And he brought[^h935] all the priests[^h3548] out of the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and defiled[^h2930] the high places[^h1116] where the priests[^h3548] had burned incense[^h6999], from Geba[^h1387] to Beersheba[^h884], and brake down[^h5422] the high places[^h1116] of the gates[^h8179] that were in the entering in[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of Joshua[^h3091] the governor[^h8269] of the city[^h5892], which were on a man's[^h376] left hand[^h8040] at the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892].
###### 9
Nevertheless the priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116] came not up[^h5927] to the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] in Jerusalem[^h3389], but they did eat[^h398] of the unleavened bread[^h4682] among[^h8432] their brethren[^h251].
###### 10
And he defiled[^h2930] Topheth[^h8612], which is in the valley[^h1516] of the children[^h1121] [^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], that no man[^h376] might make his son[^h1121] or his daughter[^h1323] to pass through[^h5674] the fire[^h784] to Molech[^h4432].
###### 11
And he took away[^h7673] the horses[^h5483] that the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had given[^h5414] to the sun[^h8121], at the entering in[^h935] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], by the chamber[^h3957] of Nathanmelech[^h5419] the chamberlain[^h5631], which was in the suburbs[^h6503], and burned[^h8313] the chariots[^h4818] of the sun[^h8121] with fire[^h784]. 
###### 12
And the altars[^h4196] that were on the top[^h1406] of the upper chamber[^h5944] of Ahaz[^h271], which the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had made[^h6213], and the altars[^h4196] which Manasseh[^h4519] had made[^h6213] in the two[^h8147] courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], did the king[^h4428] beat down[^h5422], and brake them down[^h7323] from thence, and cast[^h7993] the dust[^h6083] of them into the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939]. 
###### 13
And the high places[^h1116] that were before[^h6440] Jerusalem[^h3389], which were on the right hand[^h3225] of the mount[^h2022] of corruption[^h4889], which Solomon[^h8010] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] had builded[^h1129] for Ashtoreth[^h6253] the abomination[^h8251] of the Zidonians[^h6722], and for Chemosh[^h3645] the abomination[^h8251] of the Moabites[^h4124], and for Milcom[^h4445] the abomination[^h8441] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], did the king[^h4428] defile[^h2930]. 
###### 14
And he brake in pieces[^h7665] the images[^h4676], and cut down[^h3772] the groves[^h842], and filled[^h4390] their places[^h4725] with the bones[^h6106] of men[^h120]. 
###### 15
Moreover the altar[^h4196] that was at Bethel[^h1008], and the high place[^h1116] which Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398], had made[^h6213], both that altar[^h4196] and the high place[^h1116] he brake down[^h5422], and burned[^h8313] the high place[^h1116], and stamped[^h1854] it small to powder[^h6083], and burned[^h8313] the grove[^h842].
###### 16
And as Josiah[^h2977] turned[^h6437] himself, he spied[^h7200] the sepulchres[^h6913] that were there in the mount[^h2022], and sent[^h7971], and took[^h3947] the bones[^h6106] out of the sepulchres[^h6913], and burned[^h8313] them upon the altar[^h4196], and polluted[^h2930] it, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which the man[^h376] of God[^h430] proclaimed[^h7121], who proclaimed[^h7121] these words[^h1697].
###### 17
Then he said[^h559], What title[^h6725] is that[^h1975] that I see[^h7200]? And the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] told[^h559] him, It is the sepulchre[^h6913] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430], which came[^h935] from Judah[^h3063], and proclaimed[^h7121] these things[^h1697] that thou hast done[^h6213] against the altar[^h4196] of Bethel[^h1008].
###### 18
And he said[^h559], Let him alone[^h3240]; let no man[^h376] move[^h5128] his bones[^h6106]. So they let his bones[^h6106] alone[^h4422], with the bones[^h6106] of the prophet[^h5030] that came out[^h935] of Samaria[^h8111]. 
###### 19
And all the houses[^h1004] also of the high places[^h1116] that were in the cities[^h5892] of Samaria[^h8111], which the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] had made[^h6213] to provoke the LORD to anger[^h3707], Josiah[^h2977] took away[^h5493], and did[^h6213] to them according to all the acts[^h4639] that he had done[^h6213] in Bethel[^h1008].
###### 20
And he slew[^h2076] all the priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116] that were there upon the altars[^h4196], and burned[^h8313] men's[^h120] bones[^h6106] upon them, and returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], as it is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of this covenant[^h1285].
###### 22
Surely there was not holden[^h6213] such a passover[^h6453] from the days[^h3117] of the judges[^h8199] that judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478], nor in all the days[^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], nor of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063];
###### 23
But in the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Josiah[^h2977], wherein this passover[^h6453] was holden[^h6213] to the LORD[^h3068] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 24
Moreover the workers with familiar spirits[^h178], and the wizards[^h3049], and the images[^h8655], and the idols[^h1544], and all the abominations[^h8251] that were spied[^h7200] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063] and in Jerusalem[^h3389], did Josiah[^h2977] put away[^h1197], that he might perform[^h6965] the words[^h1697] of the law[^h8451] which were written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] that Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548] found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 25
And like unto him was there no king[^h4428] before[^h6440] him, that turned[^h7725] to the LORD[^h3068] with all his heart[^h3824], and with all his soul[^h5315], and with all his might[^h3966], according to all the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872]; neither after[^h310] him arose[^h6965] there any like him.
###### 26
Notwithstanding the LORD[^h3068] turned[^h7725] not from the fierceness[^h2740] of his great[^h1419] wrath[^h639], wherewith his anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against Judah[^h3063], because of all the provocations[^h3708] that Manasseh[^h4519] had provoked[^h3707] him withal. 
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], I will remove[^h5493] Judah[^h3063] also out of my sight[^h6440], as I have removed[^h5493] Israel[^h3478], and will cast off[^h3988] this city[^h5892] Jerusalem[^h3389] which I have chosen[^h977], and the house[^h1004] of which I said[^h559], My name[^h8034] shall be there.
###### 28
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Josiah[^h2977], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 29
In his days[^h3117] Pharaohnechoh[^h6549] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] went up[^h5927] against the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] to the river[^h5104] Euphrates[^h6578]: and king[^h4428] Josiah[^h2977] went[^h3212] against[^h7125] him; and he slew[^h4191] him at Megiddo[^h4023], when he had seen[^h7200] him.
###### 30
And his servants[^h5650] carried him in a chariot[^h7392] dead[^h4191] from Megiddo[^h4023], and brought[^h935] him to Jerusalem[^h3389], and buried[^h6912] him in his own sepulchre[^h6900]. And the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] took[^h3947] Jehoahaz[^h3059] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977], and anointed[^h4886] him, and made him king[^h4427] in his father's[^h1] stead.
###### 31
Jehoahaz[^h3059] was twenty[^h6242] and three[^h7969] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] three[^h7969] months[^h2320] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Hamutal[^h2537], the daughter[^h1323] of Jeremiah[^h3414] of Libnah[^h3841].
###### 32
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his fathers[^h1] had done[^h6213].
###### 33
And Pharaohnechoh[^h6549] put him in bands[^h631] at Riblah[^h7247] in the land[^h776] of Hamath[^h2574], that he might not reign[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389]; and put[^h5414] the land[^h776] to a tribute[^h6066] of an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and a talent[^h3603] of gold[^h2091].  
###### 34
And Pharaohnechoh[^h6549] made Eliakim[^h471] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4427] in the room of Josiah[^h2977] his father[^h1], and turned[^h5437] his name[^h8034] to Jehoiakim[^h3079], and took[^h3947] Jehoahaz[^h3059] away[^h3947]: and he came[^h935] to Egypt[^h4714], and died[^h4191] there.
###### 35
And Jehoiakim[^h3079] gave[^h5414] the silver[^h3701] and the gold[^h2091] to Pharaoh[^h6547]; but he taxed[^h6186] the land[^h776] to give[^h5414] the money[^h3701] according to the commandment[^h6310] of Pharaoh[^h6547]: he exacted[^h5065] the silver[^h3701] and the gold[^h2091] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], of every one[^h376] according to his taxation[^h6187], to give[^h5414] it unto Pharaohnechoh[^h6549].
###### 36
Jehoiakim[^h3079] was twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] eleven[^h259] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Zebudah[^h2080], the daughter[^h1323] of Pedaiah[^h6305] of Rumah[^h7316].
###### 37
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his fathers[^h1] had done[^h6213].

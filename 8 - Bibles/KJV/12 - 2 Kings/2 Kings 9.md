###### 1
And Elisha[^h477] the prophet[^h5030] called[^h7121] one[^h259] of the children[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030], and said[^h559] unto him, Gird up[^h2296] thy loins[^h4975], and take[^h3947] this box[^h6378] of oil[^h8081] in thine hand[^h3027], and go[^h3212] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]:
###### 2
And when thou comest[^h935] thither, look out[^h7200] there Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the son[^h1121] of Nimshi[^h5250], and go in[^h935], and make him arise up[^h6965] from among[^h8432] his brethren[^h251], and carry[^h935] him to an inner[^h2315] chamber[^h2315]; 
###### 3
Then take[^h3947] the box[^h6378] of oil[^h8081], and pour[^h3332] it on his head[^h7218], and say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], I have anointed[^h4886] thee king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478]. Then open[^h6605] the door[^h1817], and flee[^h5127], and tarry[^h2442] not.
###### 4
So the young man[^h5288], even the young man[^h5288] the prophet[^h5030], went[^h3212] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568].
###### 5
And when he came[^h935], behold, the captains[^h8269] of the host[^h2428] were sitting[^h3427]; and he said[^h559], I have an errand[^h1697] to thee, O captain[^h8269]. And Jehu[^h3058] said[^h559], Unto which of all us? And he said[^h559], To thee, O captain[^h8269].
###### 6
And he arose[^h6965], and went[^h935] into the house[^h1004]; and he poured[^h3332] the oil[^h8081] on his head[^h7218], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], I have anointed[^h4886] thee king[^h4428] over the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068], even over Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And thou shalt smite[^h5221] the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256] thy master[^h113], that I may avenge[^h5358] the blood[^h1818] of my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], and the blood[^h1818] of all the servants[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], at the hand[^h3027] of Jezebel[^h348].
###### 8
For the whole house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256] shall perish[^h6]: and I will cut off[^h3772] from Ahab[^h256] him that pisseth[^h8366] against the wall[^h7023], and him that is shut up[^h6113] and left[^h5800] in Israel[^h3478]:
###### 9
And I will make[^h5414] the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256] like the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], and like the house[^h1004] of Baasha[^h1201] the son[^h1121] of Ahijah[^h281]:
###### 10
And the dogs[^h3611] shall eat[^h398] Jezebel[^h348] in the portion[^h2506] of Jezreel[^h3157], and there shall be none to bury[^h6912] her. And he opened[^h6605] the door[^h1817], and fled[^h5127].
###### 11
Then Jehu[^h3058] came forth[^h3318] to the servants[^h5650] of his lord[^h113]: and one said[^h559] unto him, Is all well[^h7965]? wherefore came[^h935] this mad[^h7696] fellow to thee? And he said[^h559] unto them, Ye know[^h3045] the man[^h376], and his communication[^h7879].
###### 12
And they said[^h559], It is false[^h8267]; tell[^h5046] us now. And he said[^h559], Thus and thus spake[^h559] he to me, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], I have anointed[^h4886] thee king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 13
Then they hasted[^h4116], and took[^h3947] every man[^h376] his garment[^h899], and put[^h7760] it under him on the top[^h1634] of the stairs[^h4609], and blew[^h8628] with trumpets[^h7782], saying[^h559], Jehu[^h3058] is king[^h4427]. 
###### 14
So Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the son[^h1121] of Nimshi[^h5250] conspired[^h7194] against Joram[^h3141]. (Now Joram[^h3141] had kept[^h8104] Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568], he and all Israel[^h3478], because[^h6440] of Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758].
###### 15
But king[^h4428] Joram[^h3088] was returned[^h7725] to be healed[^h7495] in Jezreel[^h3157] of the wounds[^h4347] which the Syrians[^h761] had given[^h5221] him, when he fought[^h3898] with Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758].) And Jehu[^h3058] said[^h559], If it be[^h3426] your minds[^h5315], then let none[^h408] go forth[^h3318] nor escape[^h6412] out of the city[^h5892] to go[^h3212] to tell[^h5046] it in Jezreel[^h3157].   
###### 16
So Jehu[^h3058] rode in a chariot[^h7392], and went[^h3212] to Jezreel[^h3157]; for Joram[^h3141] lay[^h7901] there. And Ahaziah[^h274] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] was come down[^h3381] to see[^h7200] Joram[^h3141].
###### 17
And there stood[^h5975] a watchman[^h6822] on the tower[^h4026] in Jezreel[^h3157], and he spied[^h7200] the company[^h8229] of Jehu[^h3058] as he came[^h935], and said[^h559], I see[^h7200] a company[^h8229]. And Joram[^h3088] said[^h559], Take[^h3947] an horseman[^h7395], and send[^h7971] to meet[^h7125] them, and let him say[^h559], Is it peace[^h7965]?
###### 18
So there went[^h3212] one on horseback[^h7392] [^h5483] to meet[^h7125] him, and said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Is it peace[^h7965]? And Jehu[^h3058] said[^h559], What hast thou to do with peace[^h7965]? turn[^h5437] thee behind[^h310] me. And the watchman[^h6822] told[^h5046], saying[^h559], The messenger[^h4397] came[^h935] to them, but he cometh not again[^h7725].
###### 19
Then he sent out[^h7971] a second[^h8145] on horseback[^h7392] [^h5483], which came[^h935] to them, and said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Is it peace[^h7965]? And Jehu[^h3058] answered[^h559], What hast thou to do with peace[^h7965]? turn[^h5437] thee behind[^h310] me.
###### 20
And the watchman[^h6822] told[^h5046], saying[^h559], He came[^h935] even unto them, and cometh not again[^h7725]: and the driving[^h4491] is like the driving[^h4491] of Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Nimshi[^h5250]; for he driveth[^h5090] furiously[^h7697].  
###### 21
And Joram[^h3088] said[^h559], Make ready[^h631]. And his chariot[^h7393] was made ready[^h631]. And Joram[^h3088] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Ahaziah[^h274] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went out[^h3318], each[^h376] in his chariot[^h7393], and they went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] Jehu[^h3058], and met[^h4672] him in the portion[^h2513] of Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158].  
###### 22
And it came to pass, when Joram[^h3088] saw[^h7200] Jehu[^h3058], that he said[^h559], Is it peace[^h7965], Jehu[^h3058]? And he answered[^h559], What peace[^h7965], so long as[^h5704] the whoredoms[^h2183] of thy mother[^h517] Jezebel[^h348] and her witchcrafts[^h3785] are so many[^h7227]?
###### 23
And Joram[^h3088] turned[^h2015] his hands[^h3027], and fled[^h5127], and said[^h559] to Ahaziah[^h274], There is treachery[^h4820], O Ahaziah[^h274].
###### 24
And Jehu[^h3058] drew a bow[^h7198] with his full[^h4390] strength[^h3027], and smote[^h5221] Jehoram[^h3088] between his arms[^h2220], and the arrow[^h2678] went out[^h3318] at his heart[^h3820], and he sunk down[^h3766] in his chariot[^h7393].  
###### 25
Then said[^h559] Jehu to Bidkar[^h920] his captain[^h7991], Take up[^h5375], and cast[^h7993] him in the portion[^h2513] of the field[^h7704] of Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158]: for remember[^h2142] how that, when I and thou rode[^h7392] together[^h6776] after[^h310] Ahab[^h256] his father[^h1], the LORD[^h3068] laid[^h5375] this burden[^h4853] upon him;
###### 26
Surely I have seen[^h7200] yesterday[^h570] the blood[^h1818] of Naboth[^h5022], and the blood[^h1818] of his sons[^h1121], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; and I will requite[^h7999] thee in this plat[^h2513], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. Now therefore take[^h5375] and cast[^h7993] him into the plat[^h2513] of ground, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 27
But when Ahaziah[^h274] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] saw[^h7200] this, he fled[^h5127] by the way[^h1870] of the garden[^h1588] house[^h1004]. And Jehu[^h3058] followed[^h7291] after[^h310] him, and said[^h559], Smite[^h5221] him also in the chariot[^h4818]. And they did so at the going up[^h4608] to Gur[^h1483], which is by Ibleam[^h2991]. And he fled[^h5127] to Megiddo[^h4023], and died[^h4191] there.
###### 28
And his servants[^h5650] carried[^h7392] him in a chariot to Jerusalem[^h3389], and buried[^h6912] him in his sepulchre[^h6900] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732].
###### 29
And in the eleventh[^h259] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Joram[^h3141] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] began Ahaziah[^h274] to reign[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063].
###### 30
And when Jehu[^h3058] was come[^h935] to Jezreel[^h3157], Jezebel[^h348] heard[^h8085] of it; and she painted[^h7760] [^h6320] her face[^h5869], and tired[^h3190] her head[^h7218], and looked out[^h8259] at a window[^h2474]. 
###### 31
And as Jehu[^h3058] entered in[^h935] at the gate[^h8179], she said[^h559], Had Zimri[^h2174] peace[^h7965], who slew[^h2026] his master[^h113]?
###### 32
And he lifted up[^h5375] his face[^h6440] to the window[^h2474], and said[^h559], Who is on my side? who? And there looked out[^h8259] to him two[^h8147] or three[^h7969] eunuchs[^h5631]. 
###### 33
And he said[^h559], Throw her down[^h8058]. So they threw her down[^h8058]: and some of her blood[^h1818] was sprinkled[^h5137] on the wall[^h7023], and on the horses[^h5483]: and he trode her under foot[^h7429].
###### 34
And when he was come in[^h935], he did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and said[^h559], Go[^h6485], see now this cursed[^h779] woman, and bury[^h6912] her: for she is a king's[^h4428] daughter[^h1323].
###### 35
And they went[^h3212] to bury[^h6912] her: but they found[^h4672] no more of her than[^h518] the skull[^h1538], and the feet[^h7272], and the palms[^h3709] of her hands[^h3027].
###### 36
Wherefore they came again[^h7725], and told[^h5046] him. And he said[^h559], This is the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] his servant[^h5650] Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664], saying[^h559], In the portion[^h2506] of Jezreel[^h3157] shall dogs[^h3611] eat[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] of Jezebel[^h348]: 
###### 37
And the carcase[^h5038] of Jezebel[^h348] shall be as dung[^h1828] upon the face[^h6440] of the field[^h7704] in the portion[^h2506] of Jezreel[^h3157]; so that they shall not say[^h559], This is Jezebel[^h348].

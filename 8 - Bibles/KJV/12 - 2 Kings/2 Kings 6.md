###### 1
And the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] said[^h559] unto[^h6440] Elisha[^h477], Behold now, the place[^h4725] where we dwell[^h3427] with thee is too strait[^h6862] for us.
###### 2
Let us go[^h3212], we pray thee, unto Jordan[^h3383], and take[^h3947] thence every man[^h376] a[^h259] beam[^h6982], and let us make[^h6213] us a place[^h4725] there, where we may dwell[^h3427]. And he answered[^h559], Go[^h3212] ye.
###### 3
And one[^h259] said[^h559], Be content[^h2974], I pray thee, and go[^h3212] with thy servants[^h5650]. And he answered[^h559], I will go[^h3212].
###### 4
So he went[^h3212] with them. And when they came[^h935] to Jordan[^h3383], they cut down[^h1504] wood[^h6086].
###### 5
But as one[^h259] was felling[^h5307] a beam[^h6982], the axe head[^h1270] fell[^h5307] into the water[^h4325]: and he cried[^h6817], and said[^h559], Alas[^h162], master[^h113]! for it was borrowed[^h7592]. 
###### 6
And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] said[^h559], Where[^h575] fell[^h5307] it? And he shewed[^h7200] him the place[^h4725]. And he cut down[^h7094] a stick[^h6086], and cast[^h7993] it in thither; and the iron[^h1270] did swim[^h6687].
###### 7
Therefore said[^h559] he, Take it up[^h7311] to thee. And he put out[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and took[^h3947] it.
###### 8
Then the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] warred[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478], and took counsel[^h3289] with his servants[^h5650], saying[^h559], In such[^h6423] and such[^h492] a place[^h4725] shall be my camp[^h8466]. 
###### 9
And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] sent[^h7971] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Beware[^h8104] that thou pass[^h5674] not such[^h2088] a place[^h4725]; for thither the Syrians[^h758] are come down[^h5185].
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] to the place[^h4725] which the man[^h376] of God[^h430] told[^h559] him and warned[^h2094] him of, and saved[^h8104] himself there, not once[^h259] nor twice[^h8147].
###### 11
Therefore the heart[^h3820] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] was sore troubled[^h5590] for this thing[^h1697]; and he called[^h7121] his servants[^h5650], and said[^h559] unto them, Will ye not shew[^h5046] me which of us is for the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 12
And one[^h259] of his servants[^h5650] said[^h559], None, my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428]: but Elisha[^h477], the prophet[^h5030] that is in Israel[^h3478], telleth[^h5046] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] the words[^h1697] that thou speakest[^h1696] in thy bedchamber[^h2315] [^h4904]. 
###### 13
And he said[^h559], Go[^h3212] and spy[^h7200] where[^h351] he is, that I may send[^h7971] and fetch[^h3947] him. And it was told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], Behold, he is in Dothan[^h1886].
###### 14
Therefore sent[^h7971] he thither horses[^h5483], and chariots[^h7393], and a great[^h3515] host[^h2428]: and they came[^h935] by night[^h3915], and compassed[^h5362] the city[^h5892] about[^h5362]. 
###### 15
And when the servant[^h8334] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430] was risen[^h6965] early[^h7925], and gone forth[^h3318], behold, an host[^h2428] compassed[^h5437] the city[^h5892] both with horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h7393]. And his servant[^h5288] said[^h559] unto him, Alas[^h162], my master[^h113]! how shall we do[^h6213]? 
###### 16
And he answered[^h559], Fear[^h3372] not: for they that be with us are more[^h7227] than they that be with them.
###### 17
And Elisha[^h477] prayed[^h6419], and said[^h559], LORD[^h3068], I pray thee, open[^h6491] his eyes[^h5869], that he may see[^h7200]. And the LORD[^h3068] opened[^h6491] the eyes[^h5869] of the young man[^h5288]; and he saw[^h7200]: and, behold, the mountain[^h2022] was full[^h4390] of horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h7393] of fire[^h784] round about[^h5439] Elisha[^h477].
###### 18
And when they came down[^h3381] to him, Elisha[^h477] prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Smite[^h5221] this people[^h1471], I pray thee, with blindness[^h5575]. And he smote[^h5221] them with blindness[^h5575] according to the word[^h1697] of Elisha[^h477].
###### 19
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto them, This is not the way[^h1870], neither is this[^h2090] the city[^h5892]: follow[^h3212] [^h310] me, and I will bring[^h3212] you to the man[^h376] whom ye seek[^h1245]. But he led[^h3212] them to Samaria[^h8111]. 
###### 20
And it came to pass, when they were come[^h935] into Samaria[^h8111], that Elisha[^h477] said[^h559], LORD[^h3068], open[^h6491] the eyes[^h5869] of these men, that they may see[^h7200]. And the LORD[^h3068] opened[^h6491] their eyes[^h5869], and they saw[^h7200]; and, behold, they were in the midst[^h8432] of Samaria[^h8111].
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Elisha[^h477], when he saw[^h7200] them, My father[^h1], shall I smite[^h5221] them? shall I smite[^h5221] them?
###### 22
And he answered[^h559], Thou shalt not smite[^h5221] them: wouldest thou smite[^h5221] those whom thou hast taken captive[^h7617] with thy sword[^h2719] and with thy bow[^h7198]? set[^h7760] bread[^h3899] and water[^h4325] before[^h6440] them, that they may eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and go[^h3212] to their master[^h113].
###### 23
And he prepared[^h3739] great[^h1419] provision[^h3740] for them: and when they had eaten[^h398] and drunk[^h8354], he sent them away[^h7971], and they went[^h3212] to their master[^h113]. So the bands[^h1416] of Syria[^h758] came[^h935] no more[^h3254] into the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that Benhadad[^h1130] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] gathered[^h6908] all his host[^h4264], and went up[^h5927], and besieged[^h6696] Samaria[^h8111].
###### 25
And there was a great[^h1419] famine[^h7458] in Samaria[^h8111]: and, behold, they besieged[^h6696] it, until an ass's[^h2543] head[^h7218] was sold for fourscore[^h8084] pieces of silver[^h3701], and the fourth part[^h7255] of a cab[^h6894] of dove's dung[^h1686] [^h3123] [^h2755] for five[^h2568] pieces of silver[^h3701].
###### 26
And as the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] was passing by[^h5674] upon the wall[^h2346], there cried[^h6817] a woman[^h802] unto him, saying[^h559], Help[^h3467], my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428].
###### 27
And he said[^h559], If the LORD[^h3068] do not help[^h3467] thee, whence[^h370] shall I help[^h3467] thee? out of the barnfloor[^h1637], or out of the winepress[^h3342]? 
###### 28
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered[^h559], This woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto me, Give[^h5414] thy son[^h1121], that we may eat[^h398] him to day[^h3117], and we will eat[^h398] my son[^h1121] to morrow[^h4279].
###### 29
So we boiled[^h1310] my son[^h1121], and did eat[^h398] him: and I said[^h559] unto her on the next[^h312] day[^h3117], Give[^h5414] thy son[^h1121], that we may eat[^h398] him: and she hath hid[^h2244] her son[^h1121]. 
###### 30
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the woman[^h802], that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899]; and he passed by[^h5674] upon the wall[^h2346], and the people[^h5971] looked[^h7200], and, behold, he had sackcloth[^h8242] within[^h1004] upon his flesh[^h1320].
###### 31
Then he said[^h559], God[^h430] do[^h6213] so and more[^h3254] also to me, if the head[^h7218] of Elisha[^h477] the son[^h1121] of Shaphat[^h8202] shall stand[^h5975] on him this day[^h3117].
###### 32
But Elisha[^h477] sat[^h3427] in his house[^h1004], and the elders[^h2205] sat[^h3427] with him; and the king sent[^h7971] a man[^h376] from before[^h6440] him: but ere the messenger[^h4397] came[^h935] to him, he said[^h559] to the elders[^h2205], See[^h7200] ye how this son[^h1121] of a murderer[^h7523] hath sent[^h7971] to take away[^h5493] mine head[^h7218]? look[^h7200], when the messenger[^h4397] cometh[^h935], shut[^h5462] the door[^h1817], and hold him fast[^h3905] at the door[^h1817]: is not the sound[^h6963] of his master's[^h113] feet[^h7272] behind[^h310] him?
###### 33
And while he yet talked[^h1696] with them, behold, the messenger[^h4397] came down[^h3381] unto him: and he said[^h559], Behold, this evil[^h7451] is of the LORD[^h3068]; what should I wait[^h3176] for the LORD[^h3068] any longer?

###### 1
In the seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of Jehu[^h3058] Jehoash[^h3060] began to reign[^h4427]; and forty[^h705] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Zibiah[^h6645] of Beersheba[^h884].
###### 2
And Jehoash[^h3060] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] all his days[^h3117] wherein Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] instructed[^h3384] him.
###### 3
But the high places[^h1116] were not taken away[^h5493]: the people[^h5971] still sacrificed[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] in the high places[^h1116].
###### 4
And Jehoash[^h3060] said[^h559] to the priests[^h3548], All the money[^h3701] of the dedicated things[^h6944] that is brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], even the money[^h3701] of every one[^h376] that passeth[^h5674] the account, the money[^h3701] that every man[^h5315] is set at[^h6187], and all the money[^h3701] that cometh[^h5927] into any man's[^h376] heart[^h3820] to bring[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068],   
###### 5
Let the priests[^h3548] take[^h3947] it to them, every man[^h376] of his acquaintance[^h4378]: and let them repair[^h2388] the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004], wheresoever any breach[^h919] shall be found[^h4672].
###### 6
But it was so, that in the three[^h7969] [^h8141] and twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Jehoash[^h3060] the priests[^h3548] had not repaired[^h2388] the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004]. 
###### 7
Then king[^h4428] Jehoash[^h3060] called[^h7121] for Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548], and the other priests[^h3548], and said[^h559] unto them, Why repair[^h2388] ye not the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004]? now therefore receive[^h3947] no more money[^h3701] of your acquaintance[^h4378], but deliver[^h5414] it for the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004].
###### 8
And the priests[^h3548] consented[^h225] to receive[^h3947] no[^h1115] more money[^h3701] of the people[^h5971], neither[^h1115] to repair[^h2388] the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004].
###### 9
But Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] took[^h3947] a[^h259] chest[^h727], and bored[^h5344] a hole[^h2356] in the lid[^h1817] of it, and set[^h5414] it beside[^h681] the altar[^h4196], on the right side[^h3225] as one[^h376] cometh[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and the priests[^h3548] that kept[^h8104] the door[^h5592] put[^h5414] therein all the money[^h3701] that was brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 10
And it was so, when they saw[^h7200] that there was much[^h7227] money[^h3701] in the chest[^h727], that the king's[^h4428] scribe[^h5608] and the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548] came up[^h5927], and they put up in bags[^h6696], and told[^h4487] the money[^h3701] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 11
And they gave[^h5414] the money[^h3701], being told[^h8505], into the hands[^h3027] of them that did[^h6213] the work[^h4399], that had the oversight[^h6485] [^h6485] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and they laid it out[^h3318] to the carpenters[^h2796] [^h6086] and builders[^h1129], that wrought[^h6213] upon the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], 
###### 12
And to masons[^h1443], and hewers[^h2672] of stone[^h68], and to buy[^h7069] timber[^h6086] and hewed[^h4274] stone[^h68] to repair[^h2388] the breaches[^h919] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and for all that was laid out[^h3318] for the house[^h1004] to repair[^h2394] it. 
###### 13
Howbeit there were not made[^h6213] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] bowls[^h5592] of silver[^h3701], snuffers[^h4212], basons[^h4219], trumpets[^h2689], any vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], or vessels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], of the money[^h3701] that was brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 14
But they gave[^h5414] that to the workmen[^h4399] [^h6213], and repaired[^h2388] therewith the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
Moreover they reckoned[^h2803] not with the men[^h582], into whose hand[^h3027] they delivered[^h5414] the money[^h3701] to be bestowed[^h5414] on workmen[^h4399]: for they dealt[^h6213] faithfully[^h530].
###### 16
The trespass[^h817] money[^h3701] and sin[^h2403] money[^h3701] was not brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: it was the priests'[^h3548].
###### 17
Then Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] went up[^h5927], and fought[^h3898] against Gath[^h1661], and took[^h3920] it: and Hazael[^h2371] set[^h7760] his face[^h6440] to go up[^h5927] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 18
And Jehoash[^h3060] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] took[^h3947] all the hallowed things[^h6944] that Jehoshaphat[^h3092], and Jehoram[^h3088], and Ahaziah[^h274], his fathers[^h1], kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], had dedicated[^h6942], and his own hallowed things[^h6944], and all the gold[^h2091] that was found[^h4672] in the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and sent[^h7971] it to Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758]: and he went away[^h5927] from Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 19
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Joash[^h3101], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 20
And his servants[^h5650] arose[^h6965], and made[^h7194] a conspiracy[^h7195], and slew[^h5221] Joash[^h3101] in the house[^h1004] of Millo[^h4407] [^h1037], which goeth down[^h3381] to Silla[^h5538]. 
###### 21
For Jozachar[^h3108] the son[^h1121] of Shimeath[^h8100], and Jehozabad[^h3075] the son[^h1121] of Shomer[^h7763], his servants[^h5650], smote[^h5221] him, and he died[^h4191]; and they buried[^h6912] him with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Amaziah[^h558] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

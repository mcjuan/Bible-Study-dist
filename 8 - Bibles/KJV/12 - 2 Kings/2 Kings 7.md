###### 1
Then Elisha[^h477] said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] ye the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]; Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], To morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256] shall a measure[^h5429] of fine flour[^h5560] be sold for a shekel[^h8255], and two measures[^h5429] of barley[^h8184] for a shekel[^h8255], in the gate[^h8179] of Samaria[^h8111].
###### 2
Then a lord[^h7991] on whose hand[^h3027] the king[^h4428] leaned[^h8172] answered[^h6030] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and said[^h559], Behold, if the LORD[^h3068] would make[^h6213] windows[^h699] in heaven[^h8064], might this thing[^h1697] be? And he said[^h559], Behold, thou shalt see[^h7200] it with thine eyes[^h5869], but shalt not eat[^h398] thereof. 
###### 3
And there were four[^h702] leprous[^h6879] men[^h582] at the entering in[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179]: and they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], Why sit[^h3427] we here until we die[^h4191]?
###### 4
If we say[^h559], We will enter[^h935] into the city[^h5892], then the famine[^h7458] is in the city[^h5892], and we shall die[^h4191] there: and if we sit still[^h3427] here, we die[^h4191] also. Now therefore come[^h3212], and let us fall[^h5307] unto the host[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758]: if they save us alive[^h2421], we shall live[^h2421]; and if they kill[^h4191] us, we shall but die[^h4191].
###### 5
And they rose up[^h6965] in the twilight[^h5399], to go[^h935] unto the camp[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758]: and when they were come[^h935] to the uttermost part[^h7097] of the camp[^h4264] of Syria[^h758], behold, there was no man[^h376] there.
###### 6
For the Lord[^h136] had made the host[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758] to hear[^h8085] a noise[^h6963] of chariots[^h7393], and a noise[^h6963] of horses[^h5483], even the noise[^h6963] of a great[^h1419] host[^h2428]: and they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], Lo, the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] hath hired[^h7936] against us the kings[^h4428] of the Hittites[^h2850], and the kings[^h4428] of the Egyptians[^h4714], to come[^h935] upon us.
###### 7
Wherefore they arose[^h6965] and fled[^h5127] in the twilight[^h5399], and left[^h5800] their tents[^h168], and their horses[^h5483], and their asses[^h2543], even the camp[^h4264] as it was, and fled[^h5127] for their life[^h5315].
###### 8
And when these lepers[^h6879] came[^h935] to the uttermost part[^h7097] of the camp[^h4264], they went[^h935] into one[^h259] tent[^h168], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and carried[^h5375] thence silver[^h3701], and gold[^h2091], and raiment[^h899], and went[^h3212] and hid[^h2934] it; and came again[^h7725], and entered[^h935] into another[^h312] tent[^h168], and carried[^h5375] thence also, and went[^h3212] and hid[^h2934] it.
###### 9
Then they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], We do[^h6213] not well: this day[^h3117] is a day[^h3117] of good tidings[^h1309], and we hold our peace[^h2814]: if we tarry[^h2442] till the morning[^h1242] light[^h216], some mischief[^h5771] will come[^h4672] upon us: now therefore come[^h3212], that we may go[^h935] and tell[^h5046] the king's[^h4428] household[^h1004]. 
###### 10
So they came[^h935] and called[^h7121] unto the porter[^h7778] of the city[^h5892]: and they told[^h5046] them, saying[^h559], We came[^h935] to the camp[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758], and, behold, there was no man[^h376] there, neither voice[^h6963] of man[^h120], but horses[^h5483] tied[^h631], and asses[^h2543] tied[^h631], and the tents[^h168] as they were.
###### 11
And he called[^h7121] the porters[^h7778]; and they told[^h5046] it to the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004] within[^h6441].
###### 12
And the king[^h4428] arose[^h6965] in the night[^h3915], and said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], I will now shew[^h5046] you what the Syrians[^h758] have done[^h6213] to us. They know[^h3045] that we be hungry[^h7457]; therefore are they gone out[^h3318] of the camp[^h4264] to hide[^h2247] themselves in the field[^h7704], saying[^h559], When they come out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892], we shall catch[^h8610] them alive[^h2416], and get[^h935] into the city[^h5892].
###### 13
And one[^h259] of his servants[^h5650] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Let some take[^h3947], I pray thee, five[^h2568] of the horses[^h5483] that remain[^h7604], which are left[^h7604] in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude[^h1995] of Israel[^h3478] that are left[^h7604] in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude[^h1995] of the Israelites[^h3478] that are consumed[^h8552]:) and let us send[^h7971] and see[^h7200]. 
###### 14
They took[^h3947] therefore two[^h8147] chariot[^h7393] horses[^h5483]; and the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] after[^h310] the host[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] and see[^h7200].
###### 15
And they went[^h3212] after[^h310] them unto Jordan[^h3383]: and, lo, all the way[^h1870] was full[^h4392] of garments[^h899] and vessels[^h3627], which the Syrians[^h758] had cast away[^h7993] in their haste[^h2648]. And the messengers[^h4397] returned[^h7725], and told[^h5046] the king[^h4428].
###### 16
And the people[^h5971] went out[^h3318], and spoiled[^h962] the tents[^h4264] of the Syrians[^h758]. So a measure[^h5429] of fine flour[^h5560] was sold for a shekel[^h8255], and two measures[^h5429] of barley[^h8184] for a shekel[^h8255], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] appointed[^h6485] the lord[^h7991] on whose hand[^h3027] he leaned[^h8172] to have the charge of the gate[^h8179]: and the people[^h5971] trode[^h7429] upon him in the gate[^h8179], and he died[^h4191], as the man[^h376] of God[^h430] had said[^h1696], who spake[^h1696] when the king[^h4428] came down[^h3381] to him.
###### 18
And it came to pass as the man[^h376] of God[^h430] had spoken[^h1696] to the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Two measures[^h5429] of barley[^h8184] for a shekel[^h8255], and a measure[^h5429] of fine flour[^h5560] for a shekel[^h8255], shall be to morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256] in the gate[^h8179] of Samaria[^h8111]:
###### 19
And that lord[^h7991] answered[^h6030] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and said[^h559], Now, behold, if the LORD[^h3068] should make[^h6213] windows[^h699] in heaven[^h8064], might such a thing[^h1697] be? And he said[^h559], Behold, thou shalt see[^h7200] it with thine eyes[^h5869], but shalt not eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 20
And so it fell out unto him: for the people[^h5971] trode[^h7429] upon him in the gate[^h8179], and he died[^h4191].

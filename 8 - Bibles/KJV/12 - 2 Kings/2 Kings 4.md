###### 1
Now there cried[^h6817] a certain[^h259] woman[^h802] of the wives[^h802] of the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] unto Elisha[^h477], saying[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] my husband[^h376] is dead[^h4191]; and thou knowest[^h3045] that thy servant[^h5650] did fear[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068]: and the creditor[^h5383] is come[^h935] to take[^h3947] unto him my two[^h8147] sons[^h3206] to be bondmen[^h5650].
###### 2
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto her, What shall I do[^h6213] for thee? tell[^h5046] me, what hast[^h3426] thou in the house[^h1004]? And she said[^h559], Thine handmaid[^h8198] hath not any thing in the house[^h1004], save a pot[^h610] of oil[^h8081].
###### 3
Then he said[^h559], Go[^h3212], borrow[^h7592] thee vessels[^h3627] abroad[^h2351] of all thy neighbours[^h7934], even empty[^h7386] vessels[^h3627]; borrow not a few[^h4591]. 
###### 4
And when thou art come in[^h935], thou shalt shut[^h5462] the door[^h1817] upon thee and upon thy sons[^h1121], and shalt pour out[^h3332] into all those vessels[^h3627], and thou shalt set aside[^h5265] that which is full[^h4392].
###### 5
So she went[^h3212] from him, and shut[^h5462] the door[^h1817] upon her and upon[^h1157] her sons[^h1121], who[^h1992] brought[^h5066] the vessels to her; and she poured out[^h3332].
###### 6
And it came to pass, when the vessels[^h3627] were full[^h4390], that she said[^h559] unto her son[^h1121], Bring[^h5066] me yet a vessel[^h3627]. And he said[^h559] unto her, There is not a vessel[^h3627] more. And the oil[^h8081] stayed[^h5975].
###### 7
Then she came[^h935] and told[^h5046] the man[^h376] of God[^h430]. And he said[^h559], Go[^h3212], sell[^h4376] the oil[^h8081], and pay[^h7999] thy debt[^h5386], and live[^h2421] thou and thy children[^h1121] of the rest[^h3498]. 
###### 8
And it fell on a day[^h3117], that Elisha[^h477] passed[^h5674] to Shunem[^h7766], where was a great[^h1419] woman[^h802]; and she constrained[^h2388] him to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899]. And so it was, that as oft[^h1767] as he passed by[^h5674], he turned[^h5493] in thither to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899].  
###### 9
And she said[^h559] unto her husband[^h376], Behold now, I perceive[^h3045] that this is an holy[^h6918] man[^h376] of God[^h430], which passeth[^h5674] by us continually[^h8548].
###### 10
Let us make[^h6213] a little[^h6996] chamber[^h5944], I pray thee, on the wall[^h7023]; and let us set[^h7760] for him there a bed[^h4296], and a table[^h7979], and a stool[^h3678], and a candlestick[^h4501]: and it shall be, when he cometh[^h935] to us, that he shall turn[^h5493] in thither.
###### 11
And it fell on a day[^h3117], that he came[^h935] thither, and he turned[^h5493] into the chamber[^h5944], and lay[^h7901] there.
###### 12
And he said[^h559] to Gehazi[^h1522] his servant[^h5288], Call[^h7121] this Shunammite[^h7767]. And when he had called[^h7121] her, she stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him.
###### 13
And he said[^h559] unto him, Say[^h559] now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful[^h2729] for us with all this care[^h2731]; what is to be done[^h6213] for thee? wouldest[^h3426] thou be spoken[^h1696] for to the king[^h4428], or to the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635]? And she answered[^h559], I dwell[^h3427] among[^h8432] mine own people[^h5971].
###### 14
And he said[^h559], What then is to be done[^h6213] for her? And Gehazi[^h1522] answered[^h559], Verily[^h61] she hath no child[^h1121], and her husband[^h376] is old[^h2204].
###### 15
And he said[^h559], Call[^h7121] her. And when he had called[^h7121] her, she stood[^h5975] in the door[^h6607].
###### 16
And he said[^h559], About this season[^h4150], according to the time[^h6256] of life[^h2416], thou shalt embrace[^h2263] a son[^h1121]. And she said[^h559], Nay, my lord[^h113], thou man[^h376] of God[^h430], do not lie[^h3576] unto thine handmaid[^h8198]. 
###### 17
And the woman[^h802] conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121] at that season[^h4150] that Elisha[^h477] had said[^h1696] unto her, according to the time[^h6256] of life[^h2416].
###### 18
And when the child[^h3206] was grown[^h1431], it fell on a day[^h3117], that he went out[^h3318] to his father[^h1] to the reapers[^h7114].
###### 19
And he said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], My head[^h7218], my head[^h7218]. And he said[^h559] to a lad[^h5288], Carry[^h5375] him to his mother[^h517].
###### 20
And when he had taken[^h5375] him, and brought[^h935] him to his mother[^h517], he sat[^h3427] on her knees[^h1290] till noon[^h6672], and then died[^h4191].
###### 21
And she went up[^h5927], and laid[^h7901] him on the bed[^h4296] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and shut[^h5462] the door upon him, and went out[^h3318].
###### 22
And she called[^h7121] unto her husband[^h376], and said[^h559], Send[^h7971] me, I pray thee, one[^h259] of the young men[^h5288], and one[^h259] of the asses[^h860], that I may run[^h7323] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and come again[^h7725].
###### 23
And he said[^h559], Wherefore wilt thou go[^h1980] to him to day[^h3117]? it is neither new moon[^h2320], nor sabbath[^h7676]. And she said[^h559], It shall be well[^h7965]. 
###### 24
Then she saddled[^h2280] an ass[^h860], and said[^h559] to her servant[^h5288], Drive[^h5090], and go forward[^h3212]; slack[^h6113] not thy riding[^h7392] for me, except I bid[^h559] thee. 
###### 25
So she went[^h3212] and came[^h935] unto the man[^h376] of God[^h430] to mount[^h2022] Carmel[^h3760]. And it came to pass, when the man[^h376] of God[^h430] saw her afar off[^h7200], that he said[^h559] to Gehazi[^h1522] his servant[^h5288], Behold, yonder is that[^h1975] Shunammite[^h7767]:
###### 26
Run[^h7323] now, I pray thee, to meet[^h7125] her, and say[^h559] unto her, Is it well[^h7965] with thee? is it well[^h7965] with thy husband[^h376]? is it well[^h7965] with the child[^h3206]? And she answered[^h559], It is well[^h7965].
###### 27
And when she came[^h935] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430] to the hill[^h2022], she caught[^h2388] him by the feet[^h7272]: but Gehazi[^h1522] came near[^h5066] to thrust her away[^h1920]. And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] said[^h559], Let her alone[^h7503]; for her soul[^h5315] is vexed[^h4843] within her: and the LORD[^h3068] hath hid[^h5956] it from me, and hath not told[^h5046] me.  
###### 28
Then she said[^h559], Did I desire[^h7592] a son[^h1121] of my lord[^h113]? did I not say[^h559], Do not deceive[^h7952] me?
###### 29
Then he said[^h559] to Gehazi[^h1522], Gird up[^h2296] thy loins[^h4975], and take[^h3947] my staff[^h4938] in thine hand[^h3027], and go thy way[^h3212]: if thou meet[^h4672] any man[^h376], salute[^h1288] him not; and if any[^h376] salute[^h1288] thee, answer him not again[^h6030]: and lay[^h7760] my staff[^h4938] upon the face[^h6440] of the child[^h5288].
###### 30
And the mother[^h517] of the child[^h5288] said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], I will not leave[^h5800] thee. And he arose[^h6965], and followed[^h3212] [^h310] her.
###### 31
And Gehazi[^h1522] passed on[^h5674] before[^h6440] them, and laid[^h7760] the staff[^h4938] upon the face[^h6440] of the child[^h5288]; but there was neither voice[^h6963], nor hearing[^h7182]. Wherefore he went again[^h7725] to meet[^h7125] him, and told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], The child[^h5288] is not awaked[^h6974]. 
###### 32
And when Elisha[^h477] was come[^h935] into the house[^h1004], behold, the child[^h5288] was dead[^h4191], and laid[^h7901] upon his bed[^h4296].
###### 33
He went in[^h935] therefore, and shut[^h5462] the door[^h1817] upon them twain[^h8147], and prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 34
And he went up[^h5927], and lay[^h7901] upon the child[^h3206], and put[^h7760] his mouth[^h6310] upon his mouth[^h6310], and his eyes[^h5869] upon his eyes[^h5869], and his hands[^h3709] upon his hands[^h3709]: and he stretched[^h1457] himself upon the child; and the flesh[^h1320] of the child[^h3206] waxed warm[^h2552].
###### 35
Then he returned[^h7725], and walked[^h3212] in the house[^h1004] to[^h259] [^h2008] and fro[^h259] [^h2008]; and went up[^h5927], and stretched[^h1457] himself upon him: and the child[^h5288] sneezed[^h2237] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471], and the child[^h5288] opened[^h6491] his eyes[^h5869]. 
###### 36
And he called[^h7121] Gehazi[^h1522], and said[^h559], Call[^h7121] this Shunammite[^h7767]. So he called[^h7121] her. And when she was come in[^h935] unto him, he said[^h559], Take up[^h5375] thy son[^h1121].
###### 37
Then she went in[^h935], and fell[^h5307] at his feet[^h7272], and bowed[^h7812] herself to the ground[^h776], and took up[^h5375] her son[^h1121], and went out[^h3318].
###### 38
And Elisha[^h477] came again[^h7725] to Gilgal[^h1537]: and there was a dearth[^h7458] in the land[^h776]; and the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] were sitting[^h3427] before[^h6440] him: and he said[^h559] unto his servant[^h5288], Set[^h8239] on the great[^h1419] pot[^h5518], and seethe[^h1310] pottage[^h5138] for the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030].
###### 39
And one[^h259] went out[^h3318] into the field[^h7704] to gather[^h3950] herbs[^h219], and found[^h4672] a wild[^h7704] vine[^h1612], and gathered[^h3950] thereof wild[^h7704] gourds[^h6498] his lap[^h899] full[^h4393], and came[^h935] and shred[^h6398] them into the pot[^h5518] of pottage[^h5138]: for they knew[^h3045] them not.
###### 40
So they poured out[^h3332] for the men[^h582] to eat[^h398]. And it came to pass, as they were eating[^h398] of the pottage[^h5138], that they cried out[^h6817], and said[^h559], O thou man[^h376] of God[^h430], there is death[^h4194] in the pot[^h5518]. And they could[^h3201] not eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 41
But he said[^h559], Then bring[^h3947] meal[^h7058]. And he cast[^h7993] it into the pot[^h5518]; and he said[^h559], Pour out[^h3332] for the people[^h5971], that they may eat[^h398]. And there was no harm[^h1697] [^h7451] in the pot[^h5518]. 
###### 42
And there came[^h935] a man[^h376] from Baalshalisha[^h1190], and brought[^h935] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] bread[^h3899] of the firstfruits[^h1061], twenty[^h6242] loaves[^h3899] of barley[^h8184], and full ears of corn[^h3759] in the husk[^h6861] thereof. And he said[^h559], Give[^h5414] unto the people[^h5971], that they may eat[^h398]. 
###### 43
And his servitor[^h8334] said[^h559], What, should I set[^h5414] this before[^h6440] an hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]? He said again[^h559], Give[^h5414] the people[^h5971], that they may eat[^h398]: for thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], They shall eat[^h398], and shall leave[^h3498] thereof.
###### 44
So he set[^h5414] it before[^h6440] them, and they did eat[^h398], and left[^h3498] thereof, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].

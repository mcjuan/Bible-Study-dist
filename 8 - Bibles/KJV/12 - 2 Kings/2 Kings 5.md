###### 1
Now Naaman[^h5283], captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], was a great[^h1419] man[^h376] with[^h6440] his master[^h113], and honourable[^h5375], because by him the LORD[^h3068] had given[^h5414] deliverance[^h8668] unto Syria[^h758]: he was also a mighty[^h1368] man[^h376] in valour[^h2428], but he was a leper[^h6879]. 
###### 2
And the Syrians[^h758] had gone out[^h3318] by companies[^h1416], and had brought away captive[^h7617] out of the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478] a little[^h6996] maid[^h5291]; and she waited on[^h6440] Naaman's[^h5283] wife[^h802]. 
###### 3
And she said[^h559] unto her mistress[^h1404], Would[^h305] God my lord[^h113] were with[^h6440] the prophet[^h5030] that is in Samaria[^h8111]! for[^h227] he would recover[^h622] him of his leprosy[^h6883].  
###### 4
And one went in[^h935], and told[^h5046] his lord[^h113], saying[^h559], Thus and thus said[^h1696] the maid[^h5291] that is of the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] said[^h559], Go to[^h3212], go[^h935], and I will send[^h7971] a letter[^h5612] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]. And he departed[^h3212], and took[^h3947] with him[^h3027] ten[^h6235] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] pieces of gold[^h2091], and ten[^h6235] changes[^h2487] of raiment[^h899]. 
###### 6
And he brought[^h935] the letter[^h5612] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Now when this letter[^h5612] is come[^h935] unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent[^h7971] Naaman[^h5283] my servant[^h5650] to thee, that thou mayest recover[^h622] him of his leprosy[^h6883].
###### 7
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] had read[^h7121] the letter[^h5612], that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], and said[^h559], Am I God[^h430], to kill[^h4191] and to make alive[^h2421], that this man[^h2088] doth send[^h7971] unto me to recover[^h622] a man[^h376] of his leprosy[^h6883]? wherefore[^h389] consider[^h3045], I pray you, and see[^h7200] how he seeketh a quarrel[^h579] against me.
###### 8
And it was so, when Elisha[^h477] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] had heard[^h8085] that the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] had rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], that he sent[^h7971] to the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Wherefore hast thou rent[^h7167] thy clothes[^h899]? let him come[^h935] now to me, and he shall know[^h3045] that there is[^h3426] a prophet[^h5030] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 9
So Naaman[^h5283] came[^h935] with his horses[^h5483] and with his chariot[^h7393], and stood[^h5975] at the door[^h6607] of the house[^h1004] of Elisha[^h477].
###### 10
And Elisha[^h477] sent[^h7971] a messenger[^h4397] unto him, saying[^h559], Go[^h1980] and wash[^h7364] in Jordan[^h3383] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471], and thy flesh[^h1320] shall come again[^h7725] to thee, and thou shalt be clean[^h2891].
###### 11
But Naaman[^h5283] was wroth[^h7107], and went away[^h3212], and said[^h559], Behold, I thought[^h559], He will surely[^h3318] come out[^h3318] to me, and stand[^h5975], and call[^h7121] on the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and strike[^h5130] his hand[^h3027] over the place[^h4725], and recover[^h622] the leper[^h6879].  
###### 12
Are not Abana[^h71] [^h549] and Pharpar[^h6554], rivers[^h5104] of Damascus[^h1834], better[^h2896] than all the waters[^h4325] of Israel[^h3478]? may I not wash[^h7364] in them, and be clean[^h2891]? So he turned[^h6437] and went away[^h3212] in a rage[^h2534]. 
###### 13
And his servants[^h5650] came near[^h5066], and spake[^h1696] unto him, and said[^h559], My father[^h1], if the prophet[^h5030] had bid[^h1696] thee do some great[^h1419] thing[^h1697], wouldest thou not have done[^h6213] it? how much rather then[^h637], when he saith[^h559] to thee, Wash[^h7364], and be clean[^h2891]?
###### 14
Then went he down[^h3381], and dipped[^h2881] himself seven[^h7651] times[^h6471] in Jordan[^h3383], according to the saying[^h1697] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430]: and his flesh[^h1320] came again[^h7725] like unto the flesh[^h1320] of a little[^h6996] child[^h5288], and he was clean[^h2891].
###### 15
And he returned[^h7725] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430], he and all his company[^h4264], and came[^h935], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him: and he said[^h559], Behold, now I know[^h3045] that there is no God[^h430] in all the earth[^h776], but in Israel[^h3478]: now therefore, I pray thee, take[^h3947] a blessing[^h1293] of thy servant[^h5650].
###### 16
But he said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], before[^h6440] whom I stand[^h5975], I will receive[^h3947] none. And he urged[^h6484] him to take[^h3947] it; but he refused[^h3985].
###### 17
And Naaman[^h5283] said[^h559], Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given[^h5414] to thy servant[^h5650] two[^h6776] mules'[^h6505] burden[^h4853] of earth[^h127]? for thy servant[^h5650] will henceforth offer[^h6213] neither burnt offering[^h5930] nor sacrifice[^h2077] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], but unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
In this thing[^h1697] the LORD[^h3068] pardon[^h5545] thy servant[^h5650], that when my master[^h113] goeth[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of Rimmon[^h7417] to worship[^h7812] there, and he leaneth[^h8172] on my hand[^h3027], and I bow[^h7812] myself in the house[^h1004] of Rimmon[^h7417]: when I bow down[^h7812] myself in the house[^h1004] of Rimmon[^h7417], the LORD[^h3068] pardon[^h5545] thy servant[^h5650] in this thing[^h1697].
###### 19
And he said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965]. So he departed[^h3212] from him a little[^h3530] way[^h776]. 
###### 20
But Gehazi[^h1522], the servant[^h5288] of Elisha[^h477] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], said[^h559], Behold, my master[^h113] hath spared[^h2820] Naaman[^h5283] this Syrian[^h761], in not receiving[^h3947] at his hands[^h3027] that which he brought[^h935]: but, as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], I will run[^h7323] after[^h310] him, and take[^h3947] somewhat[^h3972] of him.
###### 21
So Gehazi[^h1522] followed[^h7291] after[^h310] Naaman[^h5283]. And when Naaman[^h5283] saw[^h7200] him running[^h7323] after[^h310] him, he lighted down[^h5307] from the chariot[^h4818] to meet[^h7125] him, and said[^h559], Is all well[^h7965]? 
###### 22
And he said[^h559], All is well[^h7965]. My master[^h113] hath sent[^h7971] me, saying[^h559], Behold, even now there be come[^h935] to me from mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669] two[^h8147] young men[^h5288] of the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030]: give[^h5414] them, I pray thee, a talent[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and two[^h8147] changes[^h2487] of garments[^h899].
###### 23
And Naaman[^h5283] said[^h559], Be content[^h2974], take[^h3947] two talents[^h3603]. And he urged[^h6555] him, and bound[^h6696] two[^h8147] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701] in two[^h8147] bags[^h2754], with two[^h8147] changes[^h2487] of garments[^h899], and laid[^h5414] them upon two[^h8147] of his servants[^h5288]; and they bare[^h5375] them before[^h6440] him.
###### 24
And when he came[^h935] to the tower[^h6076], he took[^h3947] them from their hand[^h3027], and bestowed[^h6485] them in the house[^h1004]: and he let the men[^h582] go[^h7971], and they departed[^h3212]. 
###### 25
But he went in[^h935], and stood[^h5975] before his master[^h113]. And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto him, Whence[^h370] comest thou, Gehazi[^h1522]? And he said[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] went[^h1980] no whither[^h575]. 
###### 26
And he said[^h559] unto him, Went[^h1980] not mine heart[^h3820] with thee, when the man[^h376] turned[^h2015] again from his chariot[^h4818] to meet[^h7125] thee? Is it a time[^h6256] to receive[^h3947] money[^h3701], and to receive[^h3947] garments[^h899], and oliveyards[^h2132], and vineyards[^h3754], and sheep[^h6629], and oxen[^h1241], and menservants[^h5650], and maidservants[^h8198]?
###### 27
The leprosy[^h6883] therefore of Naaman[^h5283] shall cleave[^h1692] unto thee, and unto thy seed[^h2233] for ever[^h5769]. And he went out[^h3318] from his presence[^h6440] a leper[^h6879] as white as snow[^h7950].

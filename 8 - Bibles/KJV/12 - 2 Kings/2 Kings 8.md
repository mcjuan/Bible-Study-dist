###### 1
Then spake[^h1696] Elisha[^h477] unto the woman[^h802], whose son[^h1121] he had restored to life[^h2421], saying[^h559], Arise[^h6965], and go[^h3212] thou and thine household[^h1004], and sojourn[^h1481] wheresoever[^h834] thou canst sojourn[^h1481]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath called[^h7121] for a famine[^h7458]; and it shall also come[^h935] upon the land[^h776] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And the woman[^h802] arose[^h6965], and did[^h6213] after the saying[^h1697] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430]: and she went[^h3212] with her household[^h1004], and sojourned[^h1481] in the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141].
###### 3
And it came to pass at the seven[^h7651] years'[^h8141] end[^h7097], that the woman[^h802] returned[^h7725] out of the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430]: and she went forth[^h3318] to cry[^h6817] unto the king[^h4428] for her house[^h1004] and for her land[^h7704].
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] talked[^h1696] with Gehazi[^h1522] the servant[^h5288] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430], saying[^h559], Tell[^h5608] me, I pray thee, all the great things[^h1419] that Elisha[^h477] hath done[^h6213].
###### 5
And it came to pass, as he was telling[^h5608] the king[^h4428] how he had restored[^h2421] a dead body[^h4191] to life[^h2421], that, behold, the woman[^h802], whose son[^h1121] he had restored to life[^h2421], cried[^h6817] to the king[^h4428] for her house[^h1004] and for her land[^h7704]. And Gehazi[^h1522] said[^h559], My lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], this is the woman[^h802], and this is her son[^h1121], whom Elisha[^h477] restored to life[^h2421].
###### 6
And when the king[^h4428] asked[^h7592] the woman[^h802], she told[^h5608] him. So the king[^h4428] appointed[^h5414] unto her a certain[^h259] officer[^h5631], saying[^h559], Restore[^h7725] all that was hers, and all the fruits[^h8393] of the field[^h7704] since the day[^h3117] that she left[^h5800] the land[^h776], even until now. 
###### 7
And Elisha[^h477] came[^h935] to Damascus[^h1834]; and Benhadad[^h1130] the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] was sick[^h2470]; and it was told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], The man[^h376] of God[^h430] is come[^h935] hither[^h2008].
###### 8
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Hazael[^h2371], Take[^h3947] a present[^h4503] in thine hand[^h3027], and go[^h3212], meet[^h7125] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068] by him, saying[^h559], Shall I recover[^h2421] of this disease[^h2483]?
###### 9
So Hazael[^h2371] went[^h3212] to meet[^h7125] him, and took[^h3947] a present[^h4503] with him[^h3027], even of every good thing[^h2898] of Damascus[^h1834], forty[^h705] camels'[^h1581] burden[^h4853], and came[^h935] and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him, and said[^h559], Thy son[^h1121] Benhadad[^h1130] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] hath sent[^h7971] me to thee, saying[^h559], Shall I recover[^h2421] of this disease[^h2483]? 
###### 10
And Elisha[^h477] said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212], say[^h559] unto him, Thou mayest certainly[^h2421] recover[^h2421]: howbeit the LORD[^h3068] hath shewed[^h7200] me that he shall surely[^h4191] die[^h4191].
###### 11
And he settled[^h5975] his countenance[^h6440] stedfastly[^h7760], until he was ashamed[^h954]: and the man[^h376] of God[^h430] wept[^h1058]. 
###### 12
And Hazael[^h2371] said[^h559], Why weepeth[^h1058] my lord[^h113]? And he answered[^h559], Because I know[^h3045] the evil[^h7451] that thou wilt do[^h6213] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: their strong holds[^h4013] wilt thou set[^h7971] on fire[^h784], and their young men[^h970] wilt thou slay[^h2026] with the sword[^h2719], and wilt dash[^h7376] their children[^h5768], and rip up[^h1234] their women with child[^h2030].
###### 13
And Hazael[^h2371] said[^h559], But what, is thy servant[^h5650] a dog[^h3611], that he should do[^h6213] this great[^h1419] thing[^h1697]? And Elisha[^h477] answered[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] hath shewed[^h7200] me that thou shalt be king[^h4428] over Syria[^h758].
###### 14
So he departed[^h3212] from Elisha[^h477], and came[^h935] to his master[^h113]; who said[^h559] to him, What said[^h559] Elisha[^h477] to thee? And he answered[^h559], He told[^h559] me that thou shouldest surely[^h2421] recover[^h2421].
###### 15
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that he took[^h3947] a thick cloth[^h4346], and dipped[^h2881] it in water[^h4325], and spread[^h6566] it on his face[^h6440], so that he died[^h4191]: and Hazael[^h2371] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 16
And in the fifth[^h2568] year[^h8141] of Joram[^h3141] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Jehoshaphat[^h3092] being then king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], Jehoram[^h3088] the son[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began to reign[^h4427]. 
###### 17
Thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was he when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 18
And he walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], as did[^h6213] the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for the daughter[^h1323] of Ahab[^h256] was his wife[^h802]: and he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
Yet the LORD[^h3068] would[^h14] not destroy[^h7843] Judah[^h3063] for David[^h1732] his servant's[^h5650] sake, as he promised[^h559] him to give[^h5414] him alway[^h3117] a light[^h5216], and to his children[^h1121]. 
###### 20
In his days[^h3117] Edom[^h123] revolted[^h6586] from under the hand[^h3027] of Judah[^h3063], and made[^h4427] a king[^h4428] over themselves.
###### 21
So Joram[^h3141] went over[^h5674] to Zair[^h6811], and all the chariots[^h7393] with him: and he rose[^h6965] by night[^h3915], and smote[^h5221] the Edomites[^h123] which compassed him about[^h5437], and the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393]: and the people[^h5971] fled[^h5127] into their tents[^h168].
###### 22
Yet Edom[^h123] revolted[^h6586] from under the hand[^h3027] of Judah[^h3063] unto this day[^h3117]. Then Libnah[^h3841] revolted[^h6586] at the same[^h1931] time[^h6256].
###### 23
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Joram[^h3141], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 24
And Joram[^h3141] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Ahaziah[^h274] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 25
In the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Joram[^h3141] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] did Ahaziah[^h274] the son[^h1121] of Jehoram[^h3088] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] begin to reign[^h4427].
###### 26
Two[^h8147] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was Ahaziah[^h274] when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] one[^h259] year[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Athaliah[^h6271], the daughter[^h1323] of Omri[^h6018] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 27
And he walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256], and did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], as did the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for he was the son in law[^h2860] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256].
###### 28
And he went[^h3212] with Joram[^h3141] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] to the war[^h4421] against Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] in Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]; and the Syrians[^h761] wounded[^h5221] Joram[^h3141].
###### 29
And king[^h4428] Joram[^h3141] went back[^h7725] to be healed[^h7495] in Jezreel[^h3157] of the wounds[^h4347] which the Syrians[^h761] had given[^h5221] him at Ramah[^h7414], when he fought[^h3898] against Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758]. And Ahaziah[^h274] the son[^h1121] of Jehoram[^h3088] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went down[^h3381] to see[^h7200] Joram[^h3141] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] in Jezreel[^h3157], because he was sick[^h2470].

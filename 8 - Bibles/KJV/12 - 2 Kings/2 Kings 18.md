###### 1
Now it came to pass in the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of Hoshea[^h1954] son[^h1121] of Elah[^h425] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that Hezekiah[^h2396] the son[^h1121] of Ahaz[^h271] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began to reign[^h4427]. 
###### 2
Twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was he when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] twenty[^h6242] and nine[^h8672] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Abi[^h21], the daughter[^h1323] of Zachariah[^h2148].
###### 3
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that David[^h1732] his father[^h1] did[^h6213].
###### 4
He removed[^h5493] the high places[^h1116], and brake[^h7665] the images[^h4676], and cut down[^h3772] the groves[^h842], and brake in pieces[^h3807] the brasen[^h5178] serpent[^h5175] that Moses[^h4872] had made[^h6213]: for unto those days[^h3117] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did burn incense[^h6999] to it: and he called[^h7121] it Nehushtan[^h5180].  
###### 5
He trusted[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; so that after[^h310] him was none like him among all the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], nor any that were before[^h6440] him.
###### 6
For he clave[^h1692] to the LORD[^h3068], and departed[^h5493] not from following[^h310] him, but kept[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687], which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872]. 
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] was with him; and he prospered[^h7919] whithersoever he went forth[^h3318]: and he rebelled[^h4775] against the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and served[^h5647] him not.
###### 8
He smote[^h5221] the Philistines[^h6430], even unto Gaza[^h5804], and the borders[^h1366] thereof, from the tower[^h4026] of the watchmen[^h5341] to the fenced[^h4013] city[^h5892]. 
###### 9
And it came to pass in the fourth[^h7243] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396], which was the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141] of Hoshea[^h1954] son[^h1121] of Elah[^h425] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that Shalmaneser[^h8022] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] came up[^h5927] against Samaria[^h8111], and besieged[^h6696] it.
###### 10
And at the end[^h7097] of three[^h7969] years[^h8141] they took[^h3920] it: even in the sixth[^h8337] year[^h8141] of Hezekiah[^h2396], that is the ninth[^h8672] year[^h8141] of Hoshea[^h1954] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Samaria[^h8111] was taken[^h3920].
###### 11
And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] did carry away[^h1540] Israel[^h3478] unto Assyria[^h804], and put[^h5148] them in Halah[^h2477] and in Habor[^h2249] by the river[^h5104] of Gozan[^h1470], and in the cities[^h5892] of the Medes[^h4074]:
###### 12
Because they obeyed[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], but transgressed[^h5674] his covenant[^h1285], and all that Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680], and would not hear[^h8085] them, nor do[^h6213] them.
###### 13
Now in the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396] did Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] come up[^h5927] against all the fenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and took[^h8610] them. 
###### 14
And Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] sent[^h7971] to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] to Lachish[^h3923], saying[^h559], I have offended[^h2398]; return[^h7725] from me: that which thou puttest[^h5414] on me will I bear[^h5375]. And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] appointed[^h7760] unto Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701] and thirty[^h7970] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091].
###### 15
And Hezekiah[^h2396] gave[^h5414] him all the silver[^h3701] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004].
###### 16
At that time[^h6256] did Hezekiah[^h2396] cut off[^h7112] the gold from the doors[^h1817] of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], and from the pillars[^h547] which Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had overlaid[^h6823], and gave[^h5414] it to the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]. 
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] sent[^h7971] Tartan[^h8661] and Rabsaris[^h7249] and Rabshakeh[^h7262] from Lachish[^h3923] to king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396] with a great[^h3515] host[^h2426] against Jerusalem[^h3389]. And they went up[^h5927] and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389]. And when they were come up[^h5927], they came[^h935] and stood[^h5975] by the conduit[^h8585] of the upper[^h5945] pool[^h1295], which is in the highway[^h4546] of the fuller's[^h3526] field[^h7704]. 
###### 18
And when they had called[^h7121] to the king[^h4428], there came out[^h3318] to them Eliakim[^h471] the son[^h1121] of Hilkiah[^h2518], which was over the household[^h1004], and Shebna[^h7644] the scribe[^h5608], and Joah[^h3098] the son[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623] the recorder[^h2142]. 
###### 19
And Rabshakeh[^h7262] said[^h559] unto them, Speak[^h559] ye now to Hezekiah[^h2396], Thus saith[^h559] the great[^h1419] king[^h4428], the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], What confidence[^h986] is this wherein thou trustest[^h982]?
###### 20
Thou sayest[^h559], (but they are but vain[^h8193] words[^h1697],) I have counsel[^h6098] and strength[^h1369] for the war[^h4421]. Now on whom dost thou trust[^h982], that thou rebellest[^h4775] against me?   
###### 21
Now, behold, thou trustest[^h982] upon the staff[^h4938] of this bruised[^h7533] reed[^h7070], even upon Egypt[^h4714], on which if a man[^h376] lean[^h5564], it will go[^h935] into his hand[^h3709], and pierce[^h5344] it: so is Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] unto all that trust[^h982] on him. 
###### 22
But if ye say[^h559] unto me, We trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]: is not that he, whose high places[^h1116] and whose altars[^h4196] Hezekiah[^h2396] hath taken away[^h5493], and hath said[^h559] to Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], Ye shall worship[^h7812] before[^h6440] this altar[^h4196] in Jerusalem[^h3389]?
###### 23
Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges[^h6148] to my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and I will deliver[^h5414] thee two thousand[^h505] horses[^h5483], if thou be able[^h3201] on thy part to set[^h5414] riders[^h7392] upon them. 
###### 24
How then wilt thou turn away[^h7725] the face[^h6440] of one[^h259] captain[^h6346] of the least[^h6996] of my master's[^h113] servants[^h5650], and put thy trust[^h982] on Egypt[^h4714] for chariots[^h7393] and for horsemen[^h6571]?
###### 25
Am I now come up[^h5927] without[^h1107] the LORD[^h3068] against this place[^h4725] to destroy[^h7843] it? The LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to me, Go up[^h5927] against this land[^h776], and destroy[^h7843] it.
###### 26
Then said[^h559] Eliakim[^h471] the son[^h1121] of Hilkiah[^h2518], and Shebna[^h7644], and Joah[^h3098], unto Rabshakeh[^h7262], Speak[^h1696], I pray thee, to thy servants[^h5650] in the Syrian language[^h762]; for we understand[^h8085] it: and talk[^h1696] not with us in the Jews' language[^h3066] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971] that are on the wall[^h2346].
###### 27
But Rabshakeh[^h7262] said[^h559] unto them, Hath my master[^h113] sent[^h7971] me to thy master[^h113], and to thee, to speak[^h1696] these words[^h1697]? hath he not sent me to the men[^h582] which sit[^h3427] on the wall[^h2346], that they may eat[^h398] their own dung[^h6675] [^h2755], and drink[^h8354] their own piss[^h4325] [^h7272] [^h7890] with you? 
###### 28
Then Rabshakeh[^h7262] stood[^h5975] and cried[^h7121] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963] in the Jews' language[^h3066], and spake[^h1696], saying[^h559], Hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the great[^h1419] king[^h4428], the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]:
###### 29
Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Let not Hezekiah[^h2396] deceive[^h5377] you: for he shall not be able[^h3201] to deliver[^h5337] you out of his hand[^h3027]:
###### 30
Neither let Hezekiah[^h2396] make you trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] will surely[^h5337] deliver[^h5337] us, and this city[^h5892] shall not be delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804].
###### 31
Hearken[^h8085] not to Hezekiah[^h2396]: for thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], Make[^h6213] an agreement with me by a present[^h1293], and come out[^h3318] to me, and then eat[^h398] ye every man[^h376] of his own vine[^h1612], and every one[^h376] of his fig tree[^h8384], and drink[^h8354] ye every one[^h376] the waters[^h4325] of his cistern[^h953]:  
###### 32
Until I come[^h935] and take you away[^h3947] to a land[^h776] like your own land[^h776], a land[^h776] of corn[^h1715] and wine[^h8492], a land[^h776] of bread[^h3899] and vineyards[^h3754], a land[^h776] of oil[^h3323] olive[^h2132] and of honey[^h1706], that ye may live[^h2421], and not die[^h4191]: and hearken[^h8085] not unto Hezekiah[^h2396], when he persuadeth[^h5496] you, saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] will deliver[^h5337] us. 
###### 33
Hath any[^h376] of the gods[^h430] of the nations[^h1471] delivered[^h5337] at all[^h5337] his land[^h776] out of the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]?
###### 34
Where are the gods[^h430] of Hamath[^h2574], and of Arpad[^h774]? where are the gods[^h430] of Sepharvaim[^h5617], Hena[^h2012], and Ivah[^h5755]? have they delivered[^h5337] Samaria[^h8111] out of mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 35
Who are they among all the gods[^h430] of the countries[^h776], that have delivered[^h5337] their country[^h776] out of mine hand[^h3027], that the LORD[^h3068] should deliver[^h5337] Jerusalem[^h3389] out of mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 36
But the people[^h5971] held their peace[^h2790], and answered[^h6030] him not a word[^h1697]: for the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h4687] was, saying[^h559], Answer[^h6030] him not.
###### 37
Then came[^h935] Eliakim[^h471] the son[^h1121] of Hilkiah[^h2518], which was over the household[^h1004], and Shebna[^h7644] the scribe[^h5608], and Joah[^h3098] the son[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623] the recorder[^h2142], to Hezekiah[^h2396] with their clothes[^h899] rent[^h7167], and told[^h5046] him the words[^h1697] of Rabshakeh[^h7262].

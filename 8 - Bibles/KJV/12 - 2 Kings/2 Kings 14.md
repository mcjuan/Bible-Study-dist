###### 1
In the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Joash[^h3101] son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3099] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] reigned[^h4427] Amaziah[^h558] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 2
He was twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] twenty[^h6242] and nine[^h8672] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Jehoaddan[^h3086] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], yet[^h7535] not like David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: he did[^h6213] according to all things as Joash[^h3101] his father[^h1] did[^h6213].
###### 4
Howbeit the high places[^h1116] were not taken away[^h5493]: as yet[^h5750] the people[^h5971] did sacrifice[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] on the high places[^h1116].
###### 5
And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom[^h4467] was confirmed[^h2388] in his hand[^h3027], that he slew[^h5221] his servants[^h5650] which had slain[^h5221] the king[^h4428] his father[^h1].
###### 6
But the children[^h1121] of the murderers[^h5221] he slew[^h4191] not: according unto that which is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], wherein the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680], saying[^h559], The fathers[^h1] shall not be put to death[^h4191] for the children[^h1121], nor the children[^h1121] be put to death[^h4191] for the fathers[^h1]; but every man[^h376] shall be put to death[^h4191] for his own sin[^h2399].
###### 7
He slew[^h5221] of Edom[^h123] in the valley[^h1516] of salt[^h4417] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505], and took[^h8610] Selah[^h5554] by war[^h4421], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of it Joktheel[^h3371] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 8
Then Amaziah[^h558] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to Jehoash[^h3060], the son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] son[^h1121] of Jehu[^h3058], king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Come[^h3212], let us look[^h7200] one another in the face[^h6440].
###### 9
And Jehoash[^h3060] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] to Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], The thistle[^h2336] that was in Lebanon[^h3844] sent[^h7971] to the cedar[^h730] that was in Lebanon[^h3844], saying[^h559], Give[^h5414] thy daughter[^h1323] to my son[^h1121] to wife[^h802]: and there passed[^h5674] by a wild[^h7704] beast[^h2416] that was in Lebanon[^h3844], and trode down[^h7429] the thistle[^h2336].
###### 10
Thou hast indeed[^h5221] smitten[^h5221] Edom[^h123], and thine heart[^h3820] hath lifted thee up[^h5375]: glory[^h3513] of this, and tarry[^h3427] at home[^h1004]: for why shouldest thou meddle[^h1624] to thy hurt[^h7451], that thou shouldest fall[^h5307], even thou, and Judah[^h3063] with thee? 
###### 11
But Amaziah[^h558] would not hear[^h8085]. Therefore Jehoash[^h3060] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927]; and he and Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] looked[^h7200] one another in the face[^h6440] at Bethshemesh[^h1053], which belongeth to Judah[^h3063].
###### 12
And Judah[^h3063] was put to the worse[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478]; and they fled[^h5127] every man[^h376] to their tents[^h168]. 
###### 13
And Jehoash[^h3060] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] took[^h8610] Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], the son[^h1121] of Jehoash[^h3060] the son[^h1121] of Ahaziah[^h274], at Bethshemesh[^h1053], and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and brake down[^h6555] the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] from the gate[^h8179] of Ephraim[^h669] unto the corner[^h6438] gate[^h8179], four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520].
###### 14
And he took[^h3947] all the gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701], and all the vessels[^h3627] that were found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and hostages[^h1121] [^h8594], and returned[^h7725] to Samaria[^h8111].
###### 15
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoash[^h3060] which he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369], and how he fought[^h3898] with Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 16
And Jehoash[^h3060] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in Samaria[^h8111] with the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]; and Jeroboam[^h3379] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 17
And Amaziah[^h558] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] lived[^h2421] after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Jehoash[^h3060] son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] years[^h8141].
###### 18
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Amaziah[^h558], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 19
Now they made[^h7194] a conspiracy[^h7195] against him in Jerusalem[^h3389]: and he fled[^h5127] to Lachish[^h3923]; but they sent[^h7971] after[^h310] him to Lachish[^h3923], and slew[^h4191] him there.
###### 20
And they brought[^h5375] him on horses[^h5483]: and he was buried[^h6912] at Jerusalem[^h3389] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732].
###### 21
And all the people[^h5971] of Judah[^h3063] took[^h3947] Azariah[^h5838], which was sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], and made him king[^h4427] instead of his father[^h1] Amaziah[^h558].
###### 22
He built[^h1129] Elath[^h359], and restored[^h7725] it to Judah[^h3063], after[^h310] that the king[^h4428] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1].
###### 23
In the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Amaziah[^h558] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] began to reign[^h4427] in Samaria[^h8111], and reigned forty[^h705] and one[^h259] years[^h8141].
###### 24
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: he departed[^h5493] not from all the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 25
He restored[^h7725] the coast[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478] from the entering[^h935] of Hamath[^h2574] unto the sea[^h3220] of the plain[^h6160], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], which he spake[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of his servant[^h5650] Jonah[^h3124], the son[^h1121] of Amittai[^h573], the prophet[^h5030], which was of Gathhepher[^h1662].
###### 26
For the LORD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] the affliction[^h6040] of Israel[^h3478], that it was very[^h3966] bitter[^h4784]: for there was not[^h657] any shut up[^h6113], nor any left[^h5800], nor any helper[^h5826] for Israel[^h3478].
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] not that he would blot out[^h4229] the name[^h8034] of Israel[^h3478] from under heaven[^h8064]: but he saved[^h3467] them by the hand[^h3027] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101].
###### 28
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jeroboam[^h3379], and all that he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369], how he warred[^h3898], and how he recovered[^h7725] Damascus[^h1834], and Hamath[^h2574], which belonged to Judah[^h3063], for Israel[^h3478], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 29
And Jeroboam[^h3379] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], even with the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]; and Zachariah[^h2148] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

###### 1
Say[^h559] ye unto your brethren[^h251], Ammi[^h5971]; and to your sisters[^h269], Ruhamah[^h7355].  
###### 2
Plead[^h7378] with your mother[^h517], plead[^h7378]: for she is not my wife[^h802], neither am I her husband[^h376]: let her therefore put away[^h5493] her whoredoms[^h2183] out of her sight[^h6440], and her adulteries[^h5005] from between her breasts[^h7699];
###### 3
Lest I strip[^h6584] her naked[^h6174], and set[^h3322] her as in the day[^h3117] that she was born[^h3205], and make[^h7760] her as a wilderness[^h4057], and set[^h7896] her like a dry[^h6723] land[^h776], and slay[^h4191] her with thirst[^h6772].
###### 4
And I will not have mercy[^h7355] upon her children[^h1121]; for they be the children[^h1121] of whoredoms[^h2183].
###### 5
For their mother[^h517] hath played the harlot[^h2181]: she that conceived[^h2029] them hath done shamefully[^h3001]: for she said[^h559], I will go[^h3212] after[^h310] my lovers[^h157], that give[^h5414] me my bread[^h3899] and my water[^h4325], my wool[^h6785] and my flax[^h6593], mine oil[^h8081] and my drink[^h8250]. 
###### 6
Therefore, behold, I will hedge[^h7753] up thy way[^h1870] with thorns[^h5518], and make[^h1443] a wall[^h1447], that she shall not find[^h4672] her paths[^h5410]. 
###### 7
And she shall follow[^h7291] after her lovers[^h157], but she shall not overtake[^h5381] them; and she shall seek[^h1245] them, but shall not find[^h4672] them: then shall she say[^h559], I will go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] to my first[^h7223] husband[^h376]; for then was it better[^h2896] with me than now[^h6258].
###### 8
For she did not know[^h3045] that I gave[^h5414] her corn[^h1715], and wine[^h8492], and oil[^h3323], and multiplied[^h7235] her silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], which they prepared[^h6213] for Baal[^h1168].  
###### 9
Therefore will I return[^h7725], and take away[^h3947] my corn[^h1715] in the time[^h6256] thereof, and my wine[^h8492] in the season[^h4150] thereof, and will recover[^h5337] my wool[^h6785] and my flax[^h6593] given to cover[^h3680] her nakedness[^h6172]. 
###### 10
And now will I discover[^h1540] her lewdness[^h5040] in the sight[^h5869] of her lovers[^h157], and none[^h376] shall deliver[^h5337] her out of mine hand[^h3027]. 
###### 11
I will also cause all her mirth[^h4885] to cease[^h7673], her feast days[^h2282], her new moons[^h2320], and her sabbaths[^h7676], and all her solemn feasts[^h4150].
###### 12
And I will destroy[^h8074] her vines[^h1612] and her fig trees[^h8384], whereof she hath said[^h559], These are my rewards[^h866] that my lovers[^h157] have given[^h5414] me: and I will make[^h7760] them a forest[^h3293], and the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] shall eat[^h398] them. 
###### 13
And I will visit[^h6485] upon her the days[^h3117] of Baalim[^h1168], wherein she burned incense[^h6999] to them, and she decked[^h5710] herself with her earrings[^h5141] and her jewels[^h2484], and she went[^h3212] after[^h310] her lovers[^h157], and forgat[^h7911] me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
Therefore, behold, I will allure[^h6601] her, and bring[^h3212] her into the wilderness[^h4057], and speak[^h1696] comfortably[^h3820] unto her. 
###### 15
And I will give[^h5414] her her vineyards[^h3754] from thence, and the valley[^h6010] of Achor[^h5911] for a door[^h6607] of hope[^h8615]: and she shall sing[^h6030] there, as in the days[^h3117] of her youth[^h5271], and as in the day[^h3117] when she came up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 16
And it shall be at that day[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that thou shalt call[^h7121] me Ishi[^h376]; and shalt call[^h7121] me no more Baali[^h1180].  
###### 17
For I will take away[^h5493] the names[^h8034] of Baalim[^h1168] out of her mouth[^h6310], and they shall no more be remembered[^h2142] by their name[^h8034].
###### 18
And in that day[^h3117] will I make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] for them with the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], and with the fowls[^h5775] of heaven[^h8064], and with the creeping things[^h7431] of the ground[^h127]: and I will break[^h7665] the bow[^h7198] and the sword[^h2719] and the battle[^h4421] out of the earth[^h776], and will make them to lie down[^h7901] safely[^h983].
###### 19
And I will betroth[^h781] thee unto me for ever[^h5769]; yea, I will betroth[^h781] thee unto me in righteousness[^h6664], and in judgment[^h4941], and in lovingkindness[^h2617], and in mercies[^h7356].
###### 20
I will even betroth[^h781] thee unto me in faithfulness[^h530]: and thou shalt know[^h3045] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], I will hear[^h6030], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], I will hear[^h6030] the heavens[^h8064], and they shall hear[^h6030] the earth[^h776];
###### 22
And the earth[^h776] shall hear[^h6030] the corn[^h1715], and the wine[^h8492], and the oil[^h3323]; and they shall hear[^h6030] Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 23
And I will sow[^h2232] her unto me in the earth[^h776]; and I will have mercy[^h7355] upon her that had not obtained mercy[^h7355] [^h3818]; and I will say[^h559] to them which were not my people[^h5971], Thou art my people[^h5971]; and they shall say[^h559], Thou art my God[^h430].

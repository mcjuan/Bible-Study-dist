###### 1
Ephraim[^h669] feedeth[^h7462] on wind[^h7307], and followeth[^h7291] after the east wind[^h6921]: he daily[^h3117] increaseth[^h7235] lies[^h3577] and desolation[^h7701]; and they do make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the Assyrians[^h804], and oil[^h8081] is carried[^h2986] into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 2
The LORD[^h3068] hath also a controversy[^h7379] with Judah[^h3063], and will punish[^h6485] Jacob[^h3290] according to his ways[^h1870]; according to his doings[^h4611] will he recompense[^h7725] him. 
###### 3
He took his brother[^h251] by the heel[^h6117] in the womb[^h990], and by his strength[^h202] he had power[^h8280] with God[^h430]: 
###### 4
Yea, he had power[^h7786] over the angel[^h4397], and prevailed[^h3201]: he wept[^h1058], and made supplication[^h2603] unto him: he found[^h4672] him in Bethel[^h1008], and there he spake[^h1696] with us;
###### 5
Even the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635]; the LORD[^h3068] is his memorial[^h2143].
###### 6
Therefore turn[^h7725] thou to thy God[^h430]: keep[^h8104] mercy[^h2617] and judgment[^h4941], and wait[^h6960] on thy God[^h430] continually[^h8548].
###### 7
He is a merchant[^h3667], the balances[^h3976] of deceit[^h4820] are in his hand[^h3027]: he loveth[^h157] to oppress[^h6231].  
###### 8
And Ephraim[^h669] said[^h559], Yet I am become rich[^h6238], I have found me out[^h4672] substance[^h202]: in all my labours[^h3018] they shall find[^h4672] none iniquity[^h5771] in me that were sin[^h2399].  
###### 9
And I that am the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] will yet make thee to dwell[^h3427] in tabernacles[^h168], as in the days[^h3117] of the solemn feast[^h4150].
###### 10
I have also spoken[^h1696] by the prophets[^h5030], and I have multiplied[^h7235] visions[^h2377], and used similitudes[^h1819], by the ministry[^h3027] of the prophets[^h5030]. 
###### 11
Is there iniquity[^h205] in Gilead[^h1568]? surely they are vanity[^h7723]: they sacrifice[^h2076] bullocks[^h7794] in Gilgal[^h1537]; yea, their altars[^h4196] are as heaps[^h1530] in the furrows[^h8525] of the fields[^h7704].
###### 12
And Jacob[^h3290] fled[^h1272] into the country[^h7704] of Syria[^h758], and Israel[^h3478] served[^h5647] for a wife[^h802], and for a wife[^h802] he kept[^h8104] sheep.
###### 13
And by a prophet[^h5030] the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h5927] Israel[^h3478] out of Egypt[^h4714], and by a prophet[^h5030] was he preserved[^h8104].
###### 14
Ephraim[^h669] provoked him to anger[^h3707] most bitterly[^h8563]: therefore shall he leave[^h5203] his blood[^h1818] upon him, and his reproach[^h2781] shall his Lord[^h113] return[^h7725] unto him.

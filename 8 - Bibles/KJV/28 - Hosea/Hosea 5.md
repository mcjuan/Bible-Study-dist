###### 1
Hear[^h8085] ye this, O priests[^h3548]; and hearken[^h7181], ye house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; and give ye ear[^h238], O house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428]; for judgment[^h4941] is toward you, because ye have been a snare[^h6341] on Mizpah[^h4709], and a net[^h7568] spread[^h6566] upon Tabor[^h8396].
###### 2
And the revolters[^h7846] are profound[^h6009] to make slaughter[^h7819], though I have been a rebuker[^h4148] of them all.  
###### 3
I know[^h3045] Ephraim[^h669], and Israel[^h3478] is not hid[^h3582] from me: for now, O Ephraim[^h669], thou committest whoredom[^h2181], and Israel[^h3478] is defiled[^h2930].
###### 4
They will not frame[^h5414] their doings[^h4611] to turn[^h7725] unto their God[^h430]: for the spirit[^h7307] of whoredoms[^h2183] is in the midst[^h7130] of them, and they have not known[^h3045] the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 5
And the pride[^h1347] of Israel[^h3478] doth testify[^h6030] to his face[^h6440]: therefore shall Israel[^h3478] and Ephraim[^h669] fall[^h3782] in their iniquity[^h5771]; Judah[^h3063] also shall fall[^h3782] with them.
###### 6
They shall go[^h3212] with their flocks[^h6629] and with their herds[^h1241] to seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068]; but they shall not find[^h4672] him; he hath withdrawn[^h2502] himself from them.
###### 7
They have dealt treacherously[^h898] against the LORD[^h3068]: for they have begotten[^h3205] strange[^h2114] children[^h1121]: now shall a month[^h2320] devour[^h398] them with their portions[^h2506].
###### 8
Blow[^h8628] ye the cornet[^h7782] in Gibeah[^h1390], and the trumpet[^h2689] in Ramah[^h7414]: cry aloud[^h7321] at Bethaven[^h1007], after[^h310] thee, O Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 9
Ephraim[^h669] shall be desolate[^h8047] in the day[^h3117] of rebuke[^h8433]: among the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] have I made known[^h3045] that which shall surely be[^h539].
###### 10
The princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063] were like them that remove[^h5253] the bound[^h1366]: therefore I will pour out[^h8210] my wrath[^h5678] upon them like water[^h4325].
###### 11
Ephraim[^h669] is oppressed[^h6231] and broken[^h7533] in judgment[^h4941], because he willingly[^h2974] walked[^h1980] after[^h310] the commandment[^h6673].
###### 12
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim[^h669] as a moth[^h6211], and to the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] as rottenness[^h7538]. 
###### 13
When Ephraim[^h669] saw[^h7200] his sickness[^h2483], and Judah[^h3063] saw his wound[^h4205], then went[^h3212] Ephraim[^h669] to the Assyrian[^h804], and sent[^h7971] to king[^h4428] Jareb[^h3377] [^h7378]: yet could[^h3201] he not heal[^h7495] you, nor cure[^h1455] you of your wound[^h4205]. 
###### 14
For I will be unto Ephraim[^h669] as a lion[^h7826], and as a young lion[^h3715] to the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063]: I, even I, will tear[^h2963] and go away[^h3212]; I will take away[^h5375], and none shall rescue[^h5337] him.
###### 15
I will go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] to my place[^h4725], till they acknowledge their offence[^h816], and seek[^h1245] my face[^h6440]: in their affliction[^h6862] they will seek me early[^h7836].

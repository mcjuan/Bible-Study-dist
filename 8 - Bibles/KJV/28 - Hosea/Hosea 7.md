###### 1
When I would have healed[^h7495] Israel[^h3478], then the iniquity[^h5771] of Ephraim[^h669] was discovered[^h1540], and the wickedness[^h7451] of Samaria[^h8111]: for they commit[^h6466] falsehood[^h8267]; and the thief[^h1590] cometh in[^h935], and the troop[^h1416] of robbers spoileth[^h6584] without[^h2351].  
###### 2
And they consider[^h559] not in their hearts[^h3824] that I remember[^h2142] all their wickedness[^h7451]: now their own doings[^h4611] have beset them about[^h5437]; they are before my face[^h6440]. 
###### 3
They make the king[^h4428] glad[^h8055] with their wickedness[^h7451], and the princes[^h8269] with their lies[^h3585].
###### 4
They are all adulterers[^h5003], as an oven[^h8574] heated[^h1197] by the baker[^h644], who ceaseth[^h7673] from raising[^h5782] after he hath kneaded[^h3888] the dough[^h1217], until it be leavened[^h2556].  
###### 5
In the day[^h3117] of our king[^h4428] the princes[^h8269] have made him sick[^h2470] with bottles[^h2534] of wine[^h3196]; he stretched out[^h4900] his hand[^h3027] with scorners[^h3945]. 
###### 6
For they have made ready[^h7126] their heart[^h3820] like an oven[^h8574], whiles they lie in wait[^h693]: their baker[^h644] sleepeth[^h3463] all the night[^h3915]; in the morning[^h1242] it burneth[^h1197] as a flaming[^h3852] fire[^h784]. 
###### 7
They are all hot[^h2552] as an oven[^h8574], and have devoured[^h398] their judges[^h8199]; all their kings[^h4428] are fallen[^h5307]: there is none among them that calleth[^h7121] unto me.
###### 8
Ephraim[^h669], he hath mixed[^h1101] himself among the people[^h5971]; Ephraim[^h669] is a cake[^h5692] not turned[^h2015].
###### 9
Strangers[^h2114] have devoured[^h398] his strength[^h3581], and he knoweth[^h3045] it not: yea, gray hairs[^h7872] are here and there[^h2236] upon him, yet he knoweth[^h3045] not. 
###### 10
And the pride[^h1347] of Israel[^h3478] testifieth[^h6030] to his face[^h6440]: and they do not return[^h7725] to the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], nor seek[^h1245] him for all this.
###### 11
Ephraim[^h669] also is like a silly[^h6601] dove[^h3123] without heart[^h3820]: they call[^h7121] to Egypt[^h4714], they go[^h1980] to Assyria[^h804].
###### 12
When they shall go[^h3212], I will spread[^h6566] my net[^h7568] upon them; I will bring them down[^h3381] as the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064]; I will chastise[^h3256] them, as their congregation[^h5712] hath heard[^h8088].
###### 13
Woe[^h188] unto them! for they have fled[^h5074] from me: destruction[^h7701] unto them! because they have transgressed[^h6586] against me: though I have redeemed[^h6299] them, yet they have spoken[^h1696] lies[^h3577] against me. 
###### 14
And they have not cried[^h2199] unto me with their heart[^h3820], when they howled[^h3213] upon their beds[^h4904]: they assemble[^h1481] themselves for corn[^h1715] and wine[^h8492], and they rebel[^h5493] against me.
###### 15
Though I have bound[^h3256] and strengthened[^h2388] their arms[^h2220], yet do they imagine[^h2803] mischief[^h7451] against me. 
###### 16
They return[^h7725], but not to the most High[^h5920]: they are like a deceitful[^h7423] bow[^h7198]: their princes[^h8269] shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719] for the rage[^h2195] of their tongue[^h3956]: this[^h2097] shall be their derision[^h3933] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].

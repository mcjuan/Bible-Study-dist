###### 1
When Ephraim[^h669] spake[^h1696] trembling[^h7578], he exalted[^h5375] himself in Israel[^h3478]; but when he offended[^h816] in Baal[^h1168], he died[^h4191].
###### 2
And now they sin[^h2398] more and more[^h3254], and have made[^h6213] them molten images[^h4541] of their silver[^h3701], and idols[^h6091] according to their own understanding[^h8394], all of it the work[^h4639] of the craftsmen[^h2796]: they say[^h559] of them, Let the men[^h120] that sacrifice[^h2076] kiss[^h5401] the calves[^h5695].  
###### 3
Therefore they shall be as the morning[^h1242] cloud[^h6051], and as the early[^h7925] dew[^h2919] that passeth away[^h1980], as the chaff[^h4671] that is driven with the whirlwind[^h5590] out of the floor[^h1637], and as the smoke[^h6227] out of the chimney[^h699].
###### 4
Yet I am the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and thou shalt know[^h3045] no god[^h430] but me[^h2108]: for there is no saviour[^h3467] beside me[^h1115].
###### 5
I did know[^h3045] thee in the wilderness[^h4057], in the land[^h776] of great drought[^h8514]. 
###### 6
According to their pasture[^h4830], so were they filled[^h7646]; they were filled[^h7646], and their heart[^h3820] was exalted[^h7311]; therefore have they forgotten[^h7911] me.
###### 7
Therefore I will be unto them as a lion[^h7826]: as a leopard[^h5246] by the way[^h1870] will I observe[^h7789] them:
###### 8
I will meet[^h6298] them as a bear[^h1677] that is bereaved[^h7909] of her whelps, and will rend[^h7167] the caul[^h5458] of their heart[^h3820], and there will I devour[^h398] them like a lion[^h3833]: the wild[^h7704] beast[^h2416] shall tear[^h1234] them. 
###### 9
O Israel[^h3478], thou hast destroyed[^h7843] thyself; but in me is thine help[^h5828]. 
###### 10
I will[^h165] be thy king[^h4428]: where[^h645] is any other that may save[^h3467] thee in all thy cities[^h5892]? and thy judges[^h8199] of whom thou saidst[^h559], Give[^h5414] me a king[^h4428] and princes[^h8269]? 
###### 11
I gave[^h5414] thee a king[^h4428] in mine anger[^h639], and took[^h3947] him away in my wrath[^h5678].
###### 12
The iniquity[^h5771] of Ephraim[^h669] is bound up[^h6887]; his sin[^h2403] is hid[^h6845].
###### 13
The sorrows[^h2256] of a travailing woman[^h3205] shall come[^h935] upon him: he is an unwise[^h2450] son[^h1121]; for he should not stay[^h5975] long[^h6256] in the place of the breaking forth[^h4866] of children[^h1121]. 
###### 14
I will ransom[^h6299] them from the power[^h3027] of the grave[^h7585]; I will redeem[^h1350] them from death[^h4194]: O death[^h4194], I will[^h165] be thy plagues[^h1698]; O grave[^h7585], I will[^h165] be thy destruction[^h6987]: repentance[^h5164] shall be hid[^h5641] from mine eyes[^h5869]. 
###### 15
Though he be fruitful[^h6500] among his brethren[^h251], an east wind[^h6921] shall come[^h935], the wind[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] shall come up[^h5927] from the wilderness[^h4057], and his spring[^h4726] shall become dry[^h954], and his fountain[^h4599] shall be dried up[^h2717]: he shall spoil[^h8154] the treasure[^h214] of all pleasant[^h2532] vessels[^h3627]. 
###### 16
Samaria[^h8111] shall become desolate[^h816]; for she hath rebelled[^h4784] against her God[^h430]: they shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]: their infants[^h5768] shall be dashed in pieces[^h7376], and their women with child[^h2030] shall be ripped up[^h1234].

###### 1
How hath the Lord[^h136] covered[^h5743] the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726] with a cloud[^h5743] in his anger[^h639], and cast down[^h7993] from heaven[^h8064] unto the earth[^h776] the beauty[^h8597] of Israel[^h3478], and remembered[^h2142] not his footstool[^h1916] [^h7272] in the day[^h3117] of his anger[^h639]!
###### 2
The Lord[^h136] hath swallowed up[^h1104] all the habitations[^h4999] of Jacob[^h3290], and hath not pitied[^h2550]: he hath thrown down[^h2040] in his wrath[^h5678] the strong holds[^h4013] of the daughter[^h1323] of Judah[^h3063]; he hath brought them down[^h5060] to the ground[^h776]: he hath polluted[^h2490] the kingdom[^h4467] and the princes[^h8269] thereof. 
###### 3
He hath cut off[^h1438] in his fierce[^h2750] anger[^h639] all the horn[^h7161] of Israel[^h3478]: he hath drawn[^h7725] back[^h268] his right hand[^h3225] from before[^h6440] the enemy[^h341], and he burned[^h1197] against Jacob[^h3290] like a flaming[^h3852] fire[^h784], which devoureth[^h398] round about[^h5439].
###### 4
He hath bent[^h1869] his bow[^h7198] like an enemy[^h341]: he stood[^h5324] with his right hand[^h3225] as an adversary[^h6862], and slew[^h2026] all that were pleasant[^h4261] to the eye[^h5869] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726]: he poured out[^h8210] his fury[^h2534] like fire[^h784]. 
###### 5
The Lord[^h136] was as an enemy[^h341]: he hath swallowed up[^h1104] Israel[^h3478], he hath swallowed up[^h1104] all her palaces[^h759]: he hath destroyed[^h7843] his strong holds[^h4013], and hath increased[^h7235] in the daughter[^h1323] of Judah[^h3063] mourning[^h8386] and lamentation[^h592].
###### 6
And he hath violently taken away[^h2554] his tabernacle[^h7900], as if it were of a garden[^h1588]: he hath destroyed[^h7843] his places of the assembly[^h4150]: the LORD[^h3068] hath caused the solemn feasts[^h4150] and sabbaths[^h7676] to be forgotten[^h7911] in Zion[^h6726], and hath despised[^h5006] in the indignation[^h2195] of his anger[^h639] the king[^h4428] and the priest[^h3548]. 
###### 7
The Lord[^h136] hath cast off[^h2186] his altar[^h4196], he hath abhorred[^h5010] his sanctuary[^h4720], he hath given up[^h5462] into the hand[^h3027] of the enemy[^h341] the walls[^h2346] of her palaces[^h759]; they have made[^h5414] a noise[^h6963] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], as in the day[^h3117] of a solemn feast[^h4150]. 
###### 8
The LORD[^h3068] hath purposed[^h2803] to destroy[^h7843] the wall[^h2346] of the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726]: he hath stretched out[^h5186] a line[^h6957], he hath not withdrawn[^h7725] his hand[^h3027] from destroying[^h1104]: therefore he made the rampart[^h2426] and the wall[^h2346] to lament[^h56]; they languished[^h535] together[^h3162]. 
###### 9
Her gates[^h8179] are sunk[^h2883] into the ground[^h776]; he hath destroyed[^h6] and broken[^h7665] her bars[^h1280]: her king[^h4428] and her princes[^h8269] are among the Gentiles[^h1471]: the law[^h8451] is no more; her prophets[^h5030] also find[^h4672] no vision[^h2377] from the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
The elders[^h2205] of the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726] sit[^h3427] upon the ground[^h776], and keep silence[^h1826]: they have cast up[^h5927] dust[^h6083] upon their heads[^h7218]; they have girded[^h2296] themselves with sackcloth[^h8242]: the virgins[^h1330] of Jerusalem[^h3389] hang down[^h3381] their heads[^h7218] to the ground[^h776].
###### 11
Mine eyes[^h5869] do fail[^h3615] with tears[^h1832], my bowels[^h4578] are troubled[^h2560], my liver[^h3516] is poured[^h8210] upon the earth[^h776], for the destruction[^h7667] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971]; because the children[^h5768] and the sucklings[^h3243] swoon[^h5848] in the streets[^h7339] of the city[^h7151]. 
###### 12
They say[^h559] to their mothers[^h517], Where is corn[^h1715] and wine[^h3196]? when they swooned[^h5848] as the wounded[^h2491] in the streets[^h7339] of the city[^h5892], when their soul[^h5315] was poured out[^h8210] into their mothers'[^h517] bosom[^h2436].
###### 13
What thing shall I take to witness[^h5749] [^h5749] for thee? what thing[^h4100] shall I liken[^h1819] to thee, O daughter[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389]? what shall I equal[^h7737] to thee, that I may comfort[^h5162] thee, O virgin[^h1330] daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726]? for thy breach[^h7667] is great[^h1419] like the sea[^h3220]: who can heal[^h7495] thee?
###### 14
Thy prophets[^h5030] have seen[^h2372] vain[^h7723] and foolish things[^h8602] for thee: and they have not discovered[^h1540] thine iniquity[^h5771], to turn away[^h7725] thy captivity[^h7622] [^h7622]; but have seen[^h2372] for thee false[^h7723] burdens[^h4864] and causes of banishment[^h4065].
###### 15
All that pass[^h5674] by clap[^h5606] their hands[^h3709] at thee[^h1870]; they hiss[^h8319] and wag[^h5128] their head[^h7218] at the daughter[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389], saying, Is this the city[^h5892] that men call[^h559] The perfection[^h3632] of beauty[^h3308], The joy[^h4885] of the whole earth[^h776]? 
###### 16
All thine enemies[^h341] have opened[^h6475] their mouth[^h6310] against thee: they hiss[^h8319] and gnash[^h2786] the teeth[^h8127]: they say[^h559], We have swallowed her up[^h1104]: certainly[^h389] this is the day[^h3117] that we looked for[^h6960]; we have found[^h4672], we have seen[^h7200] it.
###### 17
The LORD[^h3068] hath done[^h6213] that which he had devised[^h2161]; he hath fulfilled[^h1214] his word[^h565] that he had commanded[^h6680] in the days[^h3117] of old[^h6924]: he hath thrown down[^h2040], and hath not pitied[^h2550]: and he hath caused thine enemy[^h341] to rejoice[^h8055] over thee, he hath set up[^h7311] the horn[^h7161] of thine adversaries[^h6862].
###### 18
Their heart[^h3820] cried[^h6817] unto the Lord[^h136], O wall[^h2346] of the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726], let tears[^h1832] run down[^h3381] like a river[^h5158] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915]: give[^h5414] thyself no rest[^h6314]; let not the apple[^h1323] of thine eye[^h5869] cease[^h1826].
###### 19
Arise[^h6965], cry out[^h7442] in the night[^h3915]: in the beginning[^h7218] of the watches[^h821] pour out[^h8210] thine heart[^h3820] like water[^h4325] before[^h5227] the face[^h6440] of the Lord[^h136]: lift up[^h5375] thy hands[^h3709] toward him for the life[^h5315] of thy young children[^h5768], that faint[^h5848] for hunger[^h7458] in the top[^h7218] of every street[^h2351].
###### 20
Behold[^h7200], O LORD[^h3068], and consider[^h5027] to whom thou hast done[^h5953] this[^h3541]. Shall the women[^h802] eat[^h398] their fruit[^h6529], and children[^h5768] of a span long[^h2949]? shall the priest[^h3548] and the prophet[^h5030] be slain[^h2026] in the sanctuary[^h4720] of the Lord[^h136]? 
###### 21
The young[^h5288] and the old[^h2205] lie[^h7901] on the ground[^h776] in the streets[^h2351]: my virgins[^h1330] and my young men[^h970] are fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]; thou hast slain[^h2026] them in the day[^h3117] of thine anger[^h639]; thou hast killed[^h2873], and not pitied[^h2550].
###### 22
Thou hast called[^h7121] as in a solemn[^h4150] day[^h3117] my terrors[^h4032] round about[^h5439], so that in the day[^h3117] of the LORD'S[^h3068] anger[^h639] none escaped[^h6412] nor remained[^h8300]: those that I have swaddled[^h2946] and brought up[^h7235] hath mine enemy[^h341] consumed[^h3615].

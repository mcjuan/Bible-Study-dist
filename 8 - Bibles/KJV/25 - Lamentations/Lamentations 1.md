###### 1
How doth the city[^h5892] sit[^h3427] solitary[^h910], that was full[^h7227] of people[^h5971]! how is she become as a widow[^h490]! she that was great[^h7227] among the nations[^h1471], and princess[^h8282] among the provinces[^h4082], how is she become tributary[^h4522]!
###### 2
She weepeth[^h1058] sore[^h1058] in the night[^h3915], and her tears[^h1832] are on her cheeks[^h3895]: among all her lovers[^h157] she hath none to comfort[^h5162] her: all her friends[^h7453] have dealt treacherously[^h898] with her, they are become her enemies[^h341].
###### 3
Judah[^h3063] is gone into captivity[^h1540] because of affliction[^h6040], and because of great[^h7230] servitude[^h5656]: she dwelleth[^h3427] among the heathen[^h1471], she findeth[^h4672] no rest[^h4494]: all her persecutors[^h7291] overtook[^h5381] her between the straits[^h4712]. 
###### 4
The ways[^h1870] of Zion[^h6726] do mourn[^h57], because none come[^h935] to the solemn feasts[^h4150]: all her gates[^h8179] are desolate[^h8074]: her priests[^h3548] sigh[^h584], her virgins[^h1330] are afflicted[^h3013], and she is in bitterness[^h4843].
###### 5
Her adversaries[^h6862] are the chief[^h7218], her enemies[^h341] prosper[^h7951]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath afflicted[^h3013] her for the multitude[^h7230] of her transgressions[^h6588]: her children[^h5768] are gone[^h1980] into captivity[^h7628] before[^h6440] the enemy[^h6862].
###### 6
And from the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726] all her beauty[^h1926] is departed[^h3318]: her princes[^h8269] are become like harts[^h354] that find[^h4672] no pasture[^h4829], and they are gone[^h3212] without strength[^h3581] before[^h6440] the pursuer[^h7291].
###### 7
Jerusalem[^h3389] remembered[^h2142] in the days[^h3117] of her affliction[^h6040] and of her miseries[^h4788] all her pleasant things[^h4262] that she had in the days[^h3117] of old[^h6924], when her people[^h5971] fell[^h5307] into the hand[^h3027] of the enemy[^h6862], and none did help[^h5826] her: the adversaries[^h6862] saw[^h7200] her, and did mock[^h7832] at her sabbaths[^h4868]. 
###### 8
Jerusalem[^h3389] hath grievously[^h2399] sinned[^h2398]; therefore she is removed[^h5206]: all that honoured[^h3513] her despise[^h2107] her, because they have seen[^h7200] her nakedness[^h6172]: yea, she sigheth[^h584], and turneth[^h7725] backward[^h268]. 
###### 9
Her filthiness[^h2932] is in her skirts[^h7757]; she remembereth[^h2142] not her last end[^h319]; therefore she came down[^h3381] wonderfully[^h6382]: she had no comforter[^h5162]. O LORD[^h3068], behold[^h7200] my affliction[^h6040]: for the enemy[^h341] hath magnified[^h1431] himself.
###### 10
The adversary[^h6862] hath spread out[^h6566] his hand[^h3027] upon all her pleasant things[^h4261]: for she hath seen[^h7200] that the heathen[^h1471] entered[^h935] into her sanctuary[^h4720], whom thou didst command[^h6680] that they should not enter[^h935] into thy congregation[^h6951]. 
###### 11
All her people[^h5971] sigh[^h584], they seek[^h1245] bread[^h3899]; they have given[^h5414] their pleasant things[^h4261] [^h4262] for meat[^h400] to relieve[^h7725] the soul[^h5315]: see[^h7200], O LORD[^h3068], and consider[^h5027]; for I am become vile[^h2151]. 
###### 12
Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass[^h5674] by[^h1870]? behold[^h5027], and see[^h7200] if there be[^h3426] any sorrow[^h4341] like unto my sorrow[^h4341], which is done[^h5953] unto me, wherewith the LORD[^h3068] hath afflicted[^h3013] me in the day[^h3117] of his fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639].  
###### 13
From above[^h4791] hath he sent[^h7971] fire[^h784] into my bones[^h6106], and it prevaileth[^h7287] against them: he hath spread[^h6566] a net[^h7568] for my feet[^h7272], he hath turned[^h7725] me back[^h268]: he hath made[^h5414] me desolate[^h8074] and faint[^h1739] all the day[^h3117].
###### 14
The yoke[^h5923] of my transgressions[^h6588] is bound[^h8244] by his hand[^h3027]: they are wreathed[^h8276], and come up[^h5927] upon my neck[^h6677]: he hath made my strength[^h3581] to fall[^h3782], the Lord[^h136] hath delivered[^h5414] me into their hands[^h3027], from whom I am not able[^h3201] to rise up[^h6965].
###### 15
The Lord[^h136] hath trodden under foot[^h5541] all my mighty[^h47] men in the midst[^h7130] of me: he hath called[^h7121] an assembly[^h4150] against me to crush[^h7665] my young men[^h970]: the Lord[^h136] hath trodden[^h1869] the virgin[^h1330], the daughter[^h1323] of Judah[^h3063], as in a winepress[^h1660]. 
###### 16
For these things I weep[^h1058]; mine eye[^h5869], mine eye[^h5869] runneth down[^h3381] with water[^h4325], because the comforter[^h5162] that should relieve[^h7725] my soul[^h5315] is far[^h7368] from me: my children[^h1121] are desolate[^h8074], because the enemy[^h341] prevailed[^h1396]. 
###### 17
Zion[^h6726] spreadeth forth[^h6566] her hands[^h3027], and there is none to comfort[^h5162] her: the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680] concerning Jacob[^h3290], that his adversaries[^h6862] should be round about[^h5439] him: Jerusalem[^h3389] is as a menstruous woman[^h5079] among them.
###### 18
The LORD[^h3068] is righteous[^h6662]; for I have rebelled[^h4784] against his commandment[^h6310]: hear[^h8085], I pray you, all people[^h5971], and behold[^h7200] my sorrow[^h4341]: my virgins[^h1330] and my young men[^h970] are gone[^h1980] into captivity[^h7628]. 
###### 19
I called[^h7121] for my lovers[^h157], but they deceived[^h7411] me: my priests[^h3548] and mine elders[^h2205] gave up the ghost[^h1478] in the city[^h5892], while they sought[^h1245] their meat[^h400] to relieve[^h7725] their souls[^h5315].
###### 20
Behold[^h7200], O LORD[^h3068]; for I am in distress[^h6887]: my bowels[^h4578] are troubled[^h2560]; mine heart[^h3820] is turned[^h2015] within[^h7130] me; for I have grievously[^h4784] rebelled[^h4784]: abroad[^h2351] the sword[^h2719] bereaveth[^h7921], at home[^h1004] there is as death[^h4194].
###### 21
They have heard[^h8085] that I sigh[^h584]: there is none to comfort[^h5162] me: all mine enemies[^h341] have heard[^h8085] of my trouble[^h7451]; they are glad[^h7797] that thou hast done[^h6213] it: thou wilt bring[^h935] the day[^h3117] that thou hast called[^h7121], and they shall be like[^h3644] unto me. 
###### 22
Let all their wickedness[^h7451] come[^h935] before[^h6440] thee; and do[^h5953] unto them, as thou hast done[^h5953] unto me for all my transgressions[^h6588]: for my sighs[^h585] are many[^h7227], and my heart[^h3820] is faint[^h1742].

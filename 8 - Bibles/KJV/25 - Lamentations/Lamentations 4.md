###### 1
How is the gold[^h2091] become dim[^h6004]! how is the most[^h2896] fine gold[^h3800] changed[^h8132]! the stones[^h68] of the sanctuary[^h6944] are poured out[^h8210] in the top[^h7218] of every street[^h2351].
###### 2
The precious[^h3368] sons[^h1121] of Zion[^h6726], comparable[^h5537] to fine gold[^h6337], how are they esteemed[^h2803] as earthen[^h2789] pitchers[^h5035], the work[^h4639] of the hands[^h3027] of the potter[^h3335]!
###### 3
Even the sea monsters[^h8577] draw out[^h2502] the breast[^h7699], they give suck[^h3243] to their young ones[^h1482]: the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] is become cruel[^h393], like the ostriches[^h3283] in the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 4
The tongue[^h3956] of the sucking child[^h3243] cleaveth[^h1692] to the roof of his mouth[^h2441] for thirst[^h6772]: the young children[^h5768] ask[^h7592] bread[^h3899], and no man breaketh[^h6566] it unto them.
###### 5
They that did feed[^h398] delicately[^h4574] are desolate[^h8074] in the streets[^h2351]: they that were brought up[^h539] in scarlet[^h8438] embrace[^h2263] dunghills[^h830].
###### 6
For the punishment of the iniquity[^h5771] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] is greater[^h1431] than the punishment[^h2403] of the sin of Sodom[^h5467], that was overthrown[^h2015] as in a moment[^h7281], and no hands[^h3027] stayed[^h2342] on her. 
###### 7
Her Nazarites[^h5139] were purer[^h2141] than snow[^h7950], they were whiter[^h6705] than milk[^h2461], they were more ruddy[^h119] in body[^h6106] than rubies[^h6443], their polishing[^h1508] was of sapphire[^h5601]:
###### 8
Their visage[^h8389] is blacker[^h2821] than a coal[^h7815]; they are not known[^h5234] in the streets[^h2351]: their skin[^h5785] cleaveth[^h6821] to their bones[^h6106]; it is withered[^h3001], it is become like a stick[^h6086]. 
###### 9
They that be slain[^h2491] with the sword[^h2719] are better[^h2896] than they that be slain[^h2491] with hunger[^h7458]: for these[^h1992] pine away[^h2100], stricken[^h1856] through for want of the fruits[^h8570] of the field[^h7704]. 
###### 10
The hands[^h3027] of the pitiful[^h7362] women[^h802] have sodden[^h1310] their own children[^h3206]: they were their meat[^h1262] in the destruction[^h7667] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971].
###### 11
The LORD[^h3068] hath accomplished[^h3615] his fury[^h2534]; he hath poured out[^h8210] his fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639], and hath kindled[^h3341] a fire[^h784] in Zion[^h6726], and it hath devoured[^h398] the foundations[^h3247] thereof.
###### 12
The kings[^h4428] of the earth[^h776], and all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the world[^h8398], would not have believed[^h539] that the adversary[^h6862] and the enemy[^h341] should have entered[^h935] into the gates[^h8179] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 13
For the sins[^h2403] of her prophets[^h5030], and the iniquities[^h5771] of her priests[^h3548], that have shed[^h8210] the blood[^h1818] of the just[^h6662] in the midst[^h7130] of her,
###### 14
They have wandered[^h5128] as blind[^h5787] men in the streets[^h2351], they have polluted[^h1351] themselves with blood[^h1818], so that men could[^h3201] not[^h3808] touch[^h5060] their garments[^h3830]. 
###### 15
They cried[^h7121] unto them, Depart[^h5493] ye; it is unclean[^h2931]; depart[^h5493], depart[^h5493], touch[^h5060] not: when they fled away[^h5132] and wandered[^h5128], they said[^h559] among the heathen[^h1471], They shall no more[^h3254] sojourn[^h1481] there. 
###### 16
The anger[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068] hath divided[^h2505] them; he will no more[^h3254] regard[^h5027] them: they respected[^h5375] not the persons[^h6440] of the priests[^h3548], they favoured[^h2603] not the elders[^h2205]. 
###### 17
As for us, our eyes[^h5869] as yet failed[^h3615] for our vain[^h1892] help[^h5833]: in our watching[^h6836] we have watched[^h6822] for a nation[^h1471] that could not save[^h3467] us.
###### 18
They hunt[^h6679] our steps[^h6806], that we cannot go[^h3212] in our streets[^h7339]: our end[^h7093] is near[^h7126], our days[^h3117] are fulfilled[^h4390]; for our end[^h7093] is come[^h935].
###### 19
Our persecutors[^h7291] are swifter[^h7031] than the eagles[^h5404] of the heaven[^h8064]: they pursued[^h1814] us upon the mountains[^h2022], they laid wait[^h693] for us in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 20
The breath[^h7307] of our nostrils[^h639], the anointed[^h4899] of the LORD[^h3068], was taken[^h3920] in their pits[^h7825], of whom we said[^h559], Under his shadow[^h6738] we shall live[^h2421] among the heathen[^h1471].
###### 21
Rejoice[^h7797] and be glad[^h8055], O daughter[^h1323] of Edom[^h123], that dwellest[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Uz[^h5780]; the cup[^h3563] also shall pass[^h5674] through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken[^h7937], and shalt make thyself naked[^h6168].
###### 22
The punishment of thine iniquity[^h5771] is accomplished[^h8552], O daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726]; he will no more[^h3254] carry thee away into captivity[^h1540]: he will visit[^h6485] thine iniquity[^h5771], O daughter[^h1323] of Edom[^h123]; he will discover[^h1540] thy sins[^h2403].

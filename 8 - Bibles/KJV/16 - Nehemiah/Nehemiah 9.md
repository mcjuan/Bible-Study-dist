###### 1
Now in the twenty[^h6242] and fourth[^h702] day[^h3117] of this month[^h2320] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were assembled[^h622] with fasting[^h6685], and with sackclothes[^h8242], and earth[^h127] upon them.
###### 2
And the seed[^h2233] of Israel[^h3478] separated[^h914] themselves from all strangers[^h1121] [^h5236], and stood[^h5975] and confessed[^h3034] their sins[^h2403], and the iniquities[^h5771] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 3
And they stood up[^h6965] in their place[^h5977], and read[^h7121] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430] one fourth part[^h7243] of the day[^h3117]; and another fourth part[^h7243] they confessed[^h3034], and worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].
###### 4
Then stood up[^h6965] upon the stairs[^h4608], of the Levites[^h3881], Jeshua[^h3442], and Bani[^h1137], Kadmiel[^h6934], Shebaniah[^h7645], Bunni[^h1138], Sherebiah[^h8274], Bani[^h1137], and Chenani[^h3662], and cried[^h2199] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963] unto the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430]. 
###### 5
Then the Levites[^h3881], Jeshua[^h3442], and Kadmiel[^h6934], Bani[^h1137], Hashabniah[^h2813], Sherebiah[^h8274], Hodijah[^h1941], Shebaniah[^h7645], and Pethahiah[^h6611], said[^h559], Stand up[^h6965] and bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] for ever[^h5769] and ever[^h5769]: and blessed[^h1288] be thy glorious[^h3519] name[^h8034], which is exalted[^h7311] above all blessing[^h1293] and praise[^h8416].
###### 6
Thou, even thou, art LORD[^h3068] alone; thou hast made[^h6213] heaven[^h8064], the heaven[^h8064] of heavens[^h8064], with all their host[^h6635], the earth[^h776], and all things that are therein, the seas[^h3220], and all that is therein, and thou preservest[^h2421] them all; and the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064] worshippeth[^h7812] thee.
###### 7
Thou art the LORD[^h3068] the God[^h430], who didst choose[^h977] Abram[^h87], and broughtest him forth[^h3318] out of Ur[^h218] of the Chaldees[^h3778], and gavest[^h7760] him the name[^h8034] of Abraham[^h85];
###### 8
And foundest[^h4672] his heart[^h3824] faithful[^h539] before[^h6440] thee, and madest[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with him to give[^h5414] the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], the Hittites[^h2850], the Amorites[^h567], and the Perizzites[^h6522], and the Jebusites[^h2983], and the Girgashites[^h1622], to give[^h5414] it, I say, to his seed[^h2233], and hast performed[^h6965] thy words[^h1697]; for thou art righteous[^h6662]:
###### 9
And didst see[^h7200] the affliction[^h6040] of our fathers[^h1] in Egypt[^h4714], and heardest[^h8085] their cry[^h2201] by the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220];
###### 10
And shewedst[^h5414] signs[^h226] and wonders[^h4159] upon Pharaoh[^h6547], and on all his servants[^h5650], and on all the people[^h5971] of his land[^h776]: for thou knewest[^h3045] that they dealt proudly[^h2102] against them. So didst thou get[^h6213] thee a name[^h8034], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 11
And thou didst divide[^h1234] the sea[^h3220] before[^h6440] them, so that they went through[^h5674] the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220] on the dry land[^h3004]; and their persecutors[^h7291] thou threwest[^h7993] into the deeps[^h4688], as a stone[^h68] into the mighty[^h5794] waters[^h4325].
###### 12
Moreover thou leddest[^h5148] them in the day[^h3119] by a cloudy[^h6051] pillar[^h5982]; and in the night[^h3915] by a pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784], to give them light[^h215] in the way[^h1870] wherein they should go[^h3212].
###### 13
Thou camest down[^h3381] also upon mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514], and spakest[^h1696] with them from heaven[^h8064], and gavest[^h5414] them right[^h3477] judgments[^h4941], and true[^h571] laws[^h8451], good[^h2896] statutes[^h2706] and commandments[^h4687]: 
###### 14
And madest known[^h3045] unto them thy holy[^h6944] sabbath[^h7676], and commandedst[^h6680] them precepts[^h4687], statutes[^h2706], and laws[^h8451], by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872] thy servant[^h5650]:
###### 15
And gavest[^h5414] them bread[^h3899] from heaven[^h8064] for their hunger[^h7458], and broughtest forth[^h3318] water[^h4325] for them out of the rock[^h5553] for their thirst[^h6772], and promisedst[^h559] them that they should go in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which thou hadst sworn[^h3027] [^h5375] to give[^h5414] them. 
###### 16
But they and our fathers[^h1] dealt proudly[^h2102], and hardened[^h7185] their necks[^h6203], and hearkened[^h8085] not to thy commandments[^h4687],
###### 17
And refused[^h3985] to obey[^h8085], neither were mindful[^h2142] of thy wonders[^h6381] that thou didst[^h6213] among them; but hardened[^h7185] their necks[^h6203], and in their rebellion[^h4805] appointed[^h5414] a captain[^h7218] to return[^h7725] to their bondage[^h5659]: but thou art a God[^h433] ready to pardon[^h5547], gracious[^h2587] and merciful[^h7349], slow[^h750] to anger[^h639], and of great[^h7227] kindness[^h2617], and forsookest[^h5800] them not. 
###### 18
Yea, when they had made[^h6213] them a molten[^h4541] calf[^h5695], and said[^h559], This is thy God[^h430] that brought thee up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], and had wrought[^h6213] great[^h1419] provocations[^h5007];
###### 19
Yet thou in thy manifold[^h7227] mercies[^h7356] forsookest[^h5800] them not in the wilderness[^h4057]: the pillar[^h5982] of the cloud[^h6051] departed[^h5493] not from them by day[^h3119], to lead[^h5148] them in the way[^h1870]; neither the pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784] by night[^h3915], to shew them light[^h215], and the way[^h1870] wherein they should go[^h3212].
###### 20
Thou gavest[^h5414] also thy good[^h2896] spirit[^h7307] to instruct[^h7919] them, and withheldest[^h4513] not thy manna[^h4478] from their mouth[^h6310], and gavest[^h5414] them water[^h4325] for their thirst[^h6772].
###### 21
Yea, forty[^h705] years[^h8141] didst thou sustain[^h3557] them in the wilderness[^h4057], so that they lacked[^h2637] nothing; their clothes[^h8008] waxed not old[^h1086], and their feet[^h7272] swelled[^h1216] not.
###### 22
Moreover thou gavest[^h5414] them kingdoms[^h4467] and nations[^h5971], and didst divide[^h2505] them into corners[^h6285]: so they possessed[^h3423] the land[^h776] of Sihon[^h5511], and the land[^h776] of the king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], and the land[^h776] of Og[^h5747] king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316].
###### 23
Their children[^h1121] also multipliedst[^h7235] thou as the stars[^h3556] of heaven[^h8064], and broughtest[^h935] them into the land[^h776], concerning which thou hadst promised[^h559] to their fathers[^h1], that they should go in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 24
So the children[^h1121] went in[^h935] and possessed[^h3423] the land[^h776], and thou subduedst[^h3665] before[^h6440] them the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776], the Canaanites[^h3669], and gavest[^h5414] them into their hands[^h3027], with their kings[^h4428], and the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], that they might do[^h6213] with them as they would[^h7522]. 
###### 25
And they took[^h3920] strong[^h1219] cities[^h5892], and a fat[^h8082] land[^h127], and possessed[^h3423] houses[^h1004] full[^h4392] of all goods[^h2898], wells[^h953] digged[^h2672], vineyards[^h3754], and oliveyards[^h2132], and fruit[^h3978] trees[^h6086] in abundance[^h7230]: so they did eat[^h398], and were filled[^h7646], and became fat[^h8080], and delighted[^h5727] themselves in thy great[^h1419] goodness[^h2898].  
###### 26
Nevertheless they were disobedient[^h4784], and rebelled[^h4775] against thee, and cast[^h7993] thy law[^h8451] behind[^h310] their backs[^h1458], and slew[^h2026] thy prophets[^h5030] which testified[^h5749] against them to turn[^h7725] them to thee, and they wrought[^h6213] great[^h1419] provocations[^h5007].
###### 27
Therefore thou deliveredst[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h6862], who vexed[^h6887] them: and in the time[^h6256] of their trouble[^h6869], when they cried[^h6817] unto thee, thou heardest[^h8085] them from heaven[^h8064]; and according to thy manifold[^h7227] mercies[^h7356] thou gavest[^h5414] them saviours[^h3467], who saved[^h3467] them out of the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h6862].
###### 28
But after they had rest[^h5117], they did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] again[^h7725] before[^h6440] thee: therefore leftest[^h5800] thou them in the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341], so that they had the dominion[^h7287] over them: yet when they returned[^h7725], and cried[^h2199] unto thee, thou heardest[^h8085] them from heaven[^h8064]; and many[^h7227] times[^h6256] didst thou deliver[^h5337] them according to thy mercies[^h7356]; 
###### 29
And testifiedst[^h5749] against them, that thou mightest bring them again[^h7725] unto thy law[^h8451]: yet they dealt proudly[^h2102], and hearkened[^h8085] not unto thy commandments[^h4687], but sinned[^h2398] against thy judgments[^h4941], (which if a man[^h120] do[^h6213], he shall live[^h2421] in them;) and withdrew[^h5414] [^h5637] the shoulder[^h3802], and hardened[^h7185] their neck[^h6203], and would not hear[^h8085]. 
###### 30
Yet many[^h7227] years[^h8141] didst thou forbear[^h4900] them, and testifiedst[^h5749] against them by thy spirit[^h7307] in[^h3027] thy prophets[^h5030]: yet would they not give ear[^h238]: therefore gavest[^h5414] thou them into the hand[^h3027] of the people[^h5971] of the lands[^h776].  
###### 31
Nevertheless for thy great[^h7227] mercies'[^h7356] sake thou didst[^h6213] not utterly consume[^h3617] them, nor forsake[^h5800] them; for thou art a gracious[^h2587] and merciful[^h7349] God[^h410].
###### 32
Now therefore, our God[^h430], the great[^h1419], the mighty[^h1368], and the terrible[^h3372] God[^h410], who keepest[^h8104] covenant[^h1285] and mercy[^h2617], let not all the trouble[^h8513] seem little[^h4591] before[^h6440] thee, that hath come[^h4672] upon us, on our kings[^h4428], on our princes[^h8269], and on our priests[^h3548], and on our prophets[^h5030], and on our fathers[^h1], and on all thy people[^h5971], since the time[^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] unto this day[^h3117].  
###### 33
Howbeit thou art just[^h6662] in all that is brought[^h935] upon us; for thou hast done[^h6213] right[^h571], but we have done wickedly[^h7561]:
###### 34
Neither have our kings[^h4428], our princes[^h8269], our priests[^h3548], nor our fathers[^h1], kept[^h6213] thy law[^h8451], nor hearkened[^h7181] unto thy commandments[^h4687] and thy testimonies[^h5715], wherewith thou didst testify[^h5749] against them.
###### 35
For they have not served[^h5647] thee in their kingdom[^h4438], and in thy great[^h7227] goodness[^h2898] that thou gavest[^h5414] them, and in the large[^h7342] and fat[^h8082] land[^h776] which thou gavest[^h5414] before[^h6440] them, neither turned[^h7725] they from their wicked[^h7451] works[^h4611].
###### 36
Behold, we are servants[^h5650] this day[^h3117], and for the land[^h776] that thou gavest[^h5414] unto our fathers[^h1] to eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] thereof and the good[^h2898] thereof, behold, we are servants[^h5650] in it:
###### 37
And it yieldeth much[^h7235] increase[^h8393] unto the kings[^h4428] whom thou hast set[^h5414] over us because of our sins[^h2403]: also they have dominion[^h4910] over our bodies[^h1472], and over our cattle[^h929], at their pleasure[^h7522], and we are in great[^h1419] distress[^h6869].
###### 38
And because of all this we make[^h3772] a sure[^h548] covenant, and write[^h3789] it; and our princes[^h8269], Levites[^h3881], and priests[^h3548], seal[^h2856] unto it.

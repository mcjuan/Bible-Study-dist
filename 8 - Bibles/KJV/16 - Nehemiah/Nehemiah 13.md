###### 1
On that day[^h3117] they read[^h7121] in the book[^h5612] of Moses[^h4872] in the audience[^h241] of the people[^h5971]; and therein was found[^h4672] written[^h3789], that the Ammonite[^h5984] and the Moabite[^h4125] should not come[^h935] into the congregation[^h6951] of God[^h430] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769];  
###### 2
Because they met[^h6923] not the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] with bread[^h3899] and with water[^h4325], but hired[^h7936] Balaam[^h1109] against them, that he should curse[^h7043] them: howbeit our God[^h430] turned[^h2015] the curse[^h7045] into a blessing[^h1293].
###### 3
Now it came to pass, when they had heard[^h8085] the law[^h8451], that they separated[^h914] from Israel[^h3478] all the mixed multitude[^h6154].
###### 4
And before[^h6440] this, Eliashib[^h475] the priest[^h3548], having the oversight[^h5414] of the chamber[^h3957] of the house[^h1004] of our God[^h430], was allied[^h7138] unto Tobiah[^h2900]: 
###### 5
And he had prepared[^h6213] for him a great[^h1419] chamber[^h3957], where aforetime[^h6440] they laid[^h5414] the meat offerings[^h4503], the frankincense[^h3828], and the vessels[^h3627], and the tithes[^h4643] of the corn[^h1715], the new wine[^h8492], and the oil[^h3323], which was commanded[^h4687] to be given to the Levites[^h3881], and the singers[^h7891], and the porters[^h7778]; and the offerings[^h8641] of the priests[^h3548]. 
###### 6
But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem[^h3389]: for in the two[^h8147] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of Artaxerxes[^h783] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came[^h935] I unto the king[^h4428], and after[^h7093] certain days[^h3117] obtained I leave[^h7592] of the king[^h4428]:  
###### 7
And I came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and understood[^h995] of the evil[^h7451] that Eliashib[^h475] did[^h6213] for Tobiah[^h2900], in preparing[^h6213] him a chamber[^h5393] in the courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].
###### 8
And it grieved[^h3415] me sore[^h3966]: therefore I cast forth[^h7993] all the household[^h1004] stuff[^h3627] of Tobiah[^h2900] out of[^h2351] the chamber[^h3957].
###### 9
Then I commanded[^h559], and they cleansed[^h2891] the chambers[^h3957]: and thither brought I again[^h7725] the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], with the meat offering[^h4503] and the frankincense[^h3828].
###### 10
And I perceived[^h3045] that the portions[^h4521] of the Levites[^h3881] had not been given[^h5414] them: for the Levites[^h3881] and the singers[^h7891], that did[^h6213] the work[^h4399], were fled[^h1272] every one[^h376] to his field[^h7704].
###### 11
Then contended[^h7378] I with the rulers[^h5461], and said[^h559], Why is the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] forsaken[^h5800]? And I gathered them together[^h6908], and set[^h5975] them in their place[^h5977]. 
###### 12
Then brought[^h935] all Judah[^h3063] the tithe[^h4643] of the corn[^h1715] and the new wine[^h8492] and the oil[^h3323] unto the treasuries[^h214]. 
###### 13
And I made treasurers[^h686] over the treasuries[^h214], Shelemiah[^h8018] the priest[^h3548], and Zadok[^h6659] the scribe[^h5608], and of the Levites[^h3881], Pedaiah[^h6305]: and next to them[^h3027] was Hanan[^h2605] the son[^h1121] of Zaccur[^h2139], the son[^h1121] of Mattaniah[^h4983]: for they were counted[^h2803] faithful[^h539], and their office was to distribute[^h2505] unto their brethren[^h251].   
###### 14
Remember[^h2142] me, O my God[^h430], concerning this, and wipe not out[^h4229] my good[^h2617] deeds that I have done[^h6213] for the house[^h1004] of my God[^h430], and for the offices[^h4929] thereof.  
###### 15
In those days[^h3117] saw[^h7200] I in Judah[^h3063] some treading[^h1869] wine presses[^h1660] on the sabbath[^h7676], and bringing in[^h935] sheaves[^h6194], and lading[^h6006] asses[^h2543]; as also wine[^h3196], grapes[^h6025], and figs[^h8384], and all manner of burdens[^h4853], which they brought[^h935] into Jerusalem[^h3389] on the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117]: and I testified[^h5749] against them in the day[^h3117] wherein they sold[^h4376] victuals[^h6718].
###### 16
There dwelt[^h3427] men of Tyre[^h6876] also therein, which brought[^h935] fish[^h1709] [^h1709], and all manner of ware[^h4377], and sold[^h4376] on the sabbath[^h7676] unto the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063], and in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 17
Then I contended[^h7378] with the nobles[^h2715] of Judah[^h3063], and said[^h559] unto them, What evil[^h7451] thing[^h1697] is this that ye do[^h6213], and profane[^h2490] the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117]?
###### 18
Did[^h6213] not your fathers[^h1] thus, and did[^h935] not our God[^h430] bring[^h935] all this evil[^h7451] upon us, and upon this city[^h5892]? yet ye bring[^h935] more[^h3254] wrath[^h2740] upon Israel[^h3478] by profaning[^h2490] the sabbath[^h7676].
###### 19
And it came to pass, that when the gates[^h8179] of Jerusalem[^h3389] began to be dark[^h6751] before[^h6440] the sabbath[^h7676], I commanded[^h559] that the gates[^h1817] should be shut[^h5462], and charged[^h559] that they should not be opened[^h6605] till after[^h310] the sabbath[^h7676]: and some of my servants[^h5288] set[^h5975] I at the gates[^h8179], that there should no burden[^h4853] be brought in[^h935] on the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117].
###### 20
So the merchants[^h7402] and sellers[^h4376] of all kind of ware[^h4465] lodged[^h3885] without[^h2351] Jerusalem[^h3389] once[^h6471] or twice[^h8147].
###### 21
Then I testified[^h5749] against them, and said[^h559] unto them, Why lodge[^h3885] ye about[^h5048] the wall[^h2346]? if ye do so again[^h8138], I will lay[^h7971] hands[^h3027] on you. From that time[^h6256] forth came[^h935] they no more on the sabbath[^h7676]. 
###### 22
And I commanded[^h559] the Levites[^h3881] that they should cleanse[^h2891] themselves, and that they should come[^h935] and keep[^h8104] the gates[^h8179], to sanctify[^h6942] the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117]. Remember[^h2142] me, O my God[^h430], concerning this also, and spare[^h2347] me according to the greatness[^h7230] of thy mercy[^h2617]. 
###### 23
In those days[^h3117] also saw[^h7200] I Jews[^h3064] that had married[^h3427] wives[^h802] of Ashdod[^h796], of Ammon[^h5984], and of Moab[^h4125]: 
###### 24
And their children[^h1121] spake[^h1696] half[^h2677] in the speech of Ashdod[^h797], and could[^h5234] not speak[^h1696] in the Jews' language[^h3066], but according to the language[^h3956] of each[^h5971] people[^h5971].  
###### 25
And I contended[^h7378] with them, and cursed[^h7043] them, and smote[^h5221] certain[^h582] of them, and plucked off their hair[^h4803], and made them swear[^h7650] by God[^h430], saying, Ye shall not give[^h5414] your daughters[^h1323] unto their sons[^h1121], nor take[^h5375] their daughters[^h1323] unto your sons[^h1121], or for yourselves. 
###### 26
Did not Solomon[^h8010] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] sin[^h2398] by these things? yet among many[^h7227] nations[^h1471] was there no king[^h4428] like him, who was beloved[^h157] of his God[^h430], and God[^h430] made[^h5414] him king[^h4428] over all Israel[^h3478]: nevertheless even him[^h1571] did outlandish[^h5237] women[^h802] cause to sin[^h2398].
###### 27
Shall we then hearken[^h8085] unto you to do[^h6213] all this great[^h1419] evil[^h7451], to transgress[^h4603] against our God[^h430] in marrying[^h3427] strange[^h5237] wives[^h802]?
###### 28
And one of the sons[^h1121] of Joiada[^h3111], the son[^h1121] of Eliashib[^h475] the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548], was son in law[^h2860] to Sanballat[^h5571] the Horonite[^h2772]: therefore I chased[^h1272] him from me.
###### 29
Remember[^h2142] them, O my God[^h430], because they have defiled[^h1352] the priesthood[^h3550], and the covenant[^h1285] of the priesthood[^h3550], and of the Levites[^h3881]. 
###### 30
Thus cleansed[^h2891] I them from all strangers[^h5236], and appointed[^h5975] the wards[^h4931] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], every one[^h376] in his business[^h4399];
###### 31
And for the wood[^h6086] offering[^h7133], at times[^h6256] appointed[^h2163], and for the firstfruits[^h1061]. Remember[^h2142] me, O my God[^h430], for good[^h2896].

###### 1
And it came to pass in the month[^h2320] Nisan[^h5212], in the twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of Artaxerxes[^h783] the king[^h4428], that wine[^h3196] was before[^h6440] him: and I took up[^h5375] the wine[^h3196], and gave[^h5414] it unto the king[^h4428]. Now I had not been beforetime sad[^h7451] in his presence[^h6440].
###### 2
Wherefore the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto me, Why is thy countenance[^h6440] sad[^h7451], seeing thou art not sick[^h2470]? this is nothing else but sorrow[^h7455] of heart[^h3820]. Then I was very[^h3966] sore[^h7235] afraid[^h3372],
###### 3
And said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Let the king[^h4428] live[^h2421] for ever[^h5769]: why should not my countenance[^h6440] be sad[^h3415], when the city[^h5892], the place[^h1004] of my fathers'[^h1] sepulchres[^h6913], lieth waste[^h2720], and the gates[^h8179] thereof are consumed[^h398] with fire[^h784]?
###### 4
Then the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto me, For what dost thou make request[^h1245]? So I prayed[^h6419] to the God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064].
###### 5
And I said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], If it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428], and if thy servant[^h5650] have found favour[^h3190] in thy sight[^h6440], that thou wouldest send[^h7971] me unto Judah[^h3063], unto the city[^h5892] of my fathers'[^h1] sepulchres[^h6913], that I may build[^h1129] it.
###### 6
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto me, (the queen[^h7694] also sitting[^h3427] by him[^h681],) For how long shall thy journey[^h4109] be? and when wilt thou return[^h7725]? So it pleased[^h3190] [^h6440] the king[^h4428] to send[^h7971] me; and I set[^h5414] him a time[^h2165]. 
###### 7
Moreover I said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], If it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428], let letters[^h107] be given[^h5414] me to the governors[^h6346] beyond[^h5676] the river[^h5104], that they may convey me over[^h5674] till I come[^h935] into Judah[^h3063];
###### 8
And a letter[^h107] unto Asaph[^h623] the keeper[^h8104] of the king's[^h4428] forest[^h6508], that he may give[^h5414] me timber[^h6086] to make beams[^h7136] for the gates[^h8179] of the palace[^h1002] which appertained to the house[^h1004], and for the wall[^h2346] of the city[^h5892], and for the house[^h1004] that I shall enter into[^h935]. And the king[^h4428] granted[^h5414] me, according to the good[^h2896] hand[^h3027] of my God[^h430] upon me.
###### 9
Then I came[^h935] to the governors[^h6346] beyond[^h5676] the river[^h5104], and gave[^h5414] them the king's[^h4428] letters[^h107]. Now the king[^h4428] had sent[^h7971] captains[^h8269] of the army[^h2428] and horsemen[^h6571] with me.
###### 10
When Sanballat[^h5571] the Horonite[^h2772], and Tobiah[^h2900] the servant[^h5650], the Ammonite[^h5984], heard[^h8085] of it, it grieved[^h3415] them exceedingly[^h7451] [^h1419] that there was come[^h935] a man[^h120] to seek[^h1245] the welfare[^h2896] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
So I came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and was there three[^h7969] days[^h3117].
###### 12
And I arose[^h6965] in the night[^h3915], I and some[^h4592] few[^h4592] men[^h582] with me; neither told[^h5046] I any man[^h120] what my God[^h430] had put[^h5414] in my heart[^h3820] to do[^h6213] at Jerusalem[^h3389]: neither was there any beast[^h929] with me, save the beast[^h929] that I rode upon[^h7392].
###### 13
And I went out[^h3318] by night[^h3915] by the gate[^h8179] of the valley[^h1516], even before[^h6440] the dragon[^h8577] well[^h5869] [^h5886], and to the dung[^h830] port[^h8179], and viewed[^h7663] [^h7665] the walls[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389], which were broken down[^h6555], and the gates[^h8179] thereof were consumed[^h398] with fire[^h784].
###### 14
Then I went on[^h5674] to the gate[^h8179] of the fountain[^h5869], and to the king's[^h4428] pool[^h1295]: but there was no place[^h4725] for the beast[^h929] that was under me to pass[^h5674].
###### 15
Then went I up[^h5927] in the night[^h3915] by the brook[^h5158], and viewed[^h7663] [^h7665] the wall[^h2346], and turned back[^h7725], and entered[^h935] by the gate[^h8179] of the valley[^h1516], and so returned[^h7725].
###### 16
And the rulers[^h5461] knew[^h3045] not whither I went[^h1980], or what I did[^h6213]; neither had I as yet[^h3651] told[^h5046] it to the Jews[^h3064], nor to the priests[^h3548], nor to the nobles[^h2715], nor to the rulers[^h5461], nor to the rest[^h3499] that did[^h6213] the work[^h4399].
###### 17
Then said[^h559] I unto them, Ye see[^h7200] the distress[^h7451] that we are in, how Jerusalem[^h3389] lieth waste[^h2720], and the gates[^h8179] thereof are burned[^h3341] with fire[^h784]: come[^h3212], and let us build up[^h1129] the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389], that we be no more a reproach[^h2781].
###### 18
Then I told[^h5046] them of the hand[^h3027] of my God[^h430] which was good[^h2896] upon me; as also the king's[^h4428] words[^h1697] that he had spoken[^h559] unto me. And they said[^h559], Let us rise up[^h6965] and build[^h1129]. So they strengthened[^h2388] their hands[^h3027] for this good[^h2896] work.
###### 19
But when Sanballat[^h5571] the Horonite[^h2772], and Tobiah[^h2900] the servant[^h5650], the Ammonite[^h5984], and Geshem[^h1654] the Arabian[^h6163], heard[^h8085] it, they laughed us to scorn[^h3932], and despised[^h959] us, and said[^h559], What is this thing[^h1697] that ye do[^h6213]? will ye rebel[^h4775] against the king[^h4428]?
###### 20
Then answered[^h7725] [^h1697] I them, and said[^h559] unto them, The God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064], he will prosper[^h6743] us; therefore we his servants[^h5650] will arise[^h6965] and build[^h1129]: but ye have no portion[^h2506], nor right[^h6666], nor memorial[^h2146], in Jerusalem[^h3389].

###### 1
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat[^h5571] heard[^h8085] that we builded[^h1129] the wall[^h2346], he was wroth[^h2734], and took great[^h7235] indignation[^h3707], and mocked[^h3932] the Jews[^h3064].
###### 2
And he spake[^h559] before[^h6440] his brethren[^h251] and the army[^h2428] of Samaria[^h8111], and said[^h559], What do[^h6213] these feeble[^h537] Jews[^h3064]? will they fortify[^h5800] themselves? will they sacrifice[^h2076]? will they make an end[^h3615] in a day[^h3117]? will they revive[^h2421] the stones[^h68] out of the heaps[^h6194] of the rubbish[^h6083] which are burned[^h8313]? 
###### 3
Now Tobiah[^h2900] the Ammonite[^h5984] was by him[^h681], and he said[^h559], Even that which they build[^h1129], if a fox[^h7776] go up[^h5927], he shall even break down[^h6555] their stone[^h68] wall[^h2346].
###### 4
Hear[^h8085], O our God[^h430]; for we are despised[^h939]: and turn[^h7725] their reproach[^h2781] upon their own head[^h7218], and give[^h5414] them for a prey[^h961] in the land[^h776] of captivity[^h7633]: 
###### 5
And cover[^h3680] not their iniquity[^h5771], and let not their sin[^h2403] be blotted out[^h4229] from before[^h6440] thee: for they have provoked thee to anger[^h3707] before the builders[^h1129].
###### 6
So built[^h1129] we the wall[^h2346]; and all the wall[^h2346] was joined together[^h7194] unto the half[^h2677] thereof: for the people[^h5971] had a mind[^h3820] to work[^h6213].
###### 7
But it came to pass, that when Sanballat[^h5571], and Tobiah[^h2900], and the Arabians[^h6163], and the Ammonites[^h5984], and the Ashdodites[^h796], heard[^h8085] that the walls[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] were made up[^h724] [^h5927], and that the breaches[^h6555] began[^h2490] to be stopped[^h5640], then they were very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734], 
###### 8
And conspired[^h7194] all of them together[^h3162] to come[^h935] and to fight[^h3898] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and to hinder[^h6213] [^h8442] it. 
###### 9
Nevertheless we made our prayer[^h6419] unto our God[^h430], and set[^h5975] a watch[^h4929] against them day[^h3119] and night[^h3915], because[^h6440] of them.
###### 10
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559], The strength[^h3581] of the bearers of burdens[^h5449] is decayed[^h3782], and there is much[^h7235] rubbish[^h6083]; so that we are not able[^h3201] to build[^h1129] the wall[^h2346].
###### 11
And our adversaries[^h6862] said[^h559], They shall not know[^h3045], neither see[^h7200], till we come[^h935] in the midst[^h8432] among[^h8432] them, and slay[^h2026] them, and cause the work[^h4399] to cease[^h7673].
###### 12
And it came to pass, that when the Jews[^h3064] which dwelt[^h3427] by them[^h681] came[^h935], they said[^h559] unto us ten[^h6235] times[^h6471], From all places[^h4725] whence ye shall return[^h7725] unto us they will be upon you. 
###### 13
Therefore set[^h5975] I in the lower[^h8482] places[^h4725] behind[^h310] the wall[^h2346], and on the higher places[^h6706] [^h6708], I even set[^h5975] the people[^h5971] after their families[^h4940] with their swords[^h2719], their spears[^h7420], and their bows[^h7198]. 
###### 14
And I looked[^h7200], and rose up[^h6965], and said[^h559] unto the nobles[^h2715], and to the rulers[^h5461], and to the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971], Be not ye afraid[^h3372] of them[^h6440]: remember[^h2142] the Lord[^h136], which is great[^h1419] and terrible[^h3372], and fight[^h3898] for your brethren[^h251], your sons[^h1121], and your daughters[^h1323], your wives[^h802], and your houses[^h1004].
###### 15
And it came to pass, when our enemies[^h341] heard[^h8085] that it was known[^h3045] unto us, and God[^h430] had brought[^h6565] their counsel[^h6098] to nought[^h6565], that we returned[^h7725] all of us to the wall[^h2346], every one[^h376] unto his work[^h4399].
###### 16
And it came to pass from that time[^h3117] forth, that the half[^h2677] of my servants[^h5288] wrought[^h6213] in the work[^h4399], and the other half[^h2677] of them held[^h2388] both the spears[^h7420], the shields[^h4043], and the bows[^h7198], and the habergeons[^h8302]; and the rulers[^h8269] were behind[^h310] all the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 17
They which builded[^h1129] on the wall[^h2346], and they that bare[^h5375] burdens[^h5447], with those that laded[^h6006], every one with one[^h259] of his hands[^h3027] wrought[^h6213] in the work[^h4399], and with the other[^h259] hand held[^h2388] a weapon[^h7973].
###### 18
For the builders[^h1129], every one[^h376] had his sword[^h2719] girded[^h631] by his side[^h4975], and so builded[^h1129]. And he that sounded[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782] was by me[^h681]. 
###### 19
And I said[^h559] unto the nobles[^h2715], and to the rulers[^h5461], and to the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971], The work[^h4399] is great[^h7235] and large[^h7342], and we are separated[^h6504] upon the wall[^h2346], one[^h376] far from[^h7350] another[^h251].
###### 20
In what place[^h4725] therefore ye hear[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], resort[^h6908] ye thither unto us: our God[^h430] shall fight[^h3898] for us.
###### 21
So we laboured[^h6213] in the work[^h4399]: and half[^h2677] of them held[^h2388] the spears[^h7420] from the rising[^h5927] of the morning[^h7837] till the stars[^h3556] appeared[^h3318].
###### 22
Likewise at the same time[^h6256] said[^h559] I unto the people[^h5971], Let every one[^h376] with his servant[^h5288] lodge[^h3885] within[^h8432] Jerusalem[^h3389], that in the night[^h3915] they may be a guard[^h4929] to us, and labour[^h4399] on the day[^h3117].
###### 23
So neither I, nor my brethren[^h251], nor my servants[^h5288], nor the men[^h582] of the guard[^h4929] which followed[^h310] me, none of us[^h587] put off[^h6584] our clothes[^h899], saving that every one[^h376] put them off[^h7973] for washing[^h4325].

###### 1
And all the people[^h5971] gathered themselves together[^h622] as one[^h259] man[^h376] into the street[^h7339] that was before[^h6440] the water[^h4325] gate[^h8179]; and they spake[^h559] unto Ezra[^h5830] the scribe[^h5608] to bring[^h935] the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], which the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] to Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And Ezra[^h5830] the priest[^h3548] brought[^h935] the law[^h8451] before[^h6440] the congregation[^h6951] both of men[^h376] and women[^h802], and all that could hear[^h8085] with understanding[^h995], upon the first[^h259] day[^h3117] of the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320]. 
###### 3
And he read[^h7121] therein before[^h6440] the street[^h7339] that was before[^h6440] the water[^h4325] gate[^h8179] from the morning[^h216] until midday[^h4276] [^h3117], before the men[^h582] and the women[^h802], and those that could understand[^h995]; and the ears[^h241] of all the people[^h5971] were attentive unto the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451]. 
###### 4
And Ezra[^h5830] the scribe[^h5608] stood[^h5975] upon a pulpit[^h4026] of wood[^h6086], which they had made[^h6213] for the purpose[^h1697]; and beside[^h681] him stood[^h5975] Mattithiah[^h4993], and Shema[^h8087], and Anaiah[^h6043], and Urijah[^h223], and Hilkiah[^h2518], and Maaseiah[^h4641], on his right hand[^h3225]; and on his left hand[^h8040], Pedaiah[^h6305], and Mishael[^h4332], and Malchiah[^h4441], and Hashum[^h2828], and Hashbadana[^h2806], Zechariah[^h2148], and Meshullam[^h4918]. 
###### 5
And Ezra[^h5830] opened[^h6605] the book[^h5612] in the sight[^h5869] of all the people[^h5971]; (for he was above all the people[^h5971];) and when he opened[^h6605] it, all the people[^h5971] stood up[^h5975]: 
###### 6
And Ezra[^h5830] blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], the great[^h1419] God[^h430]. And all the people[^h5971] answered[^h6030], Amen[^h543], Amen[^h543], with lifting up[^h4607] their hands[^h3027]: and they bowed[^h6915] their heads, and worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068] with their faces[^h639] to the ground[^h776].
###### 7
Also Jeshua[^h3442], and Bani[^h1137], and Sherebiah[^h8274], Jamin[^h3226], Akkub[^h6126], Shabbethai[^h7678], Hodijah[^h1941], Maaseiah[^h4641], Kelita[^h7042], Azariah[^h5838], Jozabad[^h3107], Hanan[^h2605], Pelaiah[^h6411], and the Levites[^h3881], caused the people[^h5971] to understand[^h995] the law[^h8451]: and the people[^h5971] stood in their place[^h5977].
###### 8
So they read[^h7121] in the book[^h5612] in the law[^h8451] of God[^h430] distinctly[^h6567], and gave[^h7760] the sense[^h7922], and caused them to understand[^h995] the reading[^h4744].
###### 9
And Nehemiah[^h5166], which is the Tirshatha[^h8660], and Ezra[^h5830] the priest[^h3548] the scribe[^h5608], and the Levites[^h3881] that taught[^h995] the people[^h5971], said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], This day[^h3117] is holy[^h6918] unto the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; mourn[^h56] not, nor weep[^h1058]. For all the people[^h5971] wept[^h1058], when they heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the law[^h8451]. 
###### 10
Then he said[^h559] unto them, Go your way[^h3212], eat[^h398] the fat[^h4924], and drink[^h8354] the sweet[^h4477], and send[^h7971] portions[^h4490] unto them for whom nothing is prepared[^h3559]: for this day[^h3117] is holy[^h6918] unto our Lord[^h113]: neither be ye sorry[^h6087]; for the joy[^h2304] of the LORD[^h3068] is your strength[^h4581].
###### 11
So the Levites[^h3881] stilled[^h2814] all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Hold your peace[^h2013], for the day[^h3117] is holy[^h6918]; neither be ye grieved[^h6087].
###### 12
And all the people[^h5971] went their way[^h3212] to eat[^h398], and to drink[^h8354], and to send[^h7971] portions[^h4490], and to make[^h6213] great[^h1419] mirth[^h8057], because they had understood[^h995] the words[^h1697] that were declared[^h3045] unto them.
###### 13
And on the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] were gathered together[^h622] the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of all the people[^h5971], the priests[^h3548], and the Levites[^h3881], unto Ezra[^h5830] the scribe[^h5608], even to understand[^h7919] the words[^h1697] of the law[^h8451]. 
###### 14
And they found[^h4672] written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] which the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] by[^h3027] Moses[^h4872], that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] should dwell[^h3427] in booths[^h5521] in the feast[^h2282] of the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320]: 
###### 15
And that they should publish[^h8085] and proclaim[^h5674] [^h6963] in all their cities[^h5892], and in Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], Go forth[^h3318] unto the mount[^h2022], and fetch[^h935] olive[^h2132] branches[^h5929], and pine[^h8081] branches[^h6086] [^h5929], and myrtle[^h1918] branches[^h5929], and palm[^h8558] branches[^h5929], and branches[^h5929] of thick[^h5687] trees[^h6086], to make[^h6213] booths[^h5521], as it is written[^h3789].
###### 16
So the people[^h5971] went forth[^h3318], and brought[^h935] them, and made[^h6213] themselves booths[^h5521], every one[^h376] upon the roof of his house[^h1406], and in their courts[^h2691], and in the courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and in the street[^h7339] of the water[^h4325] gate[^h8179], and in the street[^h7339] of the gate[^h8179] of Ephraim[^h669].
###### 17
And all the congregation[^h6951] of them that were come again[^h7725] out of the captivity[^h7628] made[^h6213] booths[^h5521], and sat[^h3427] under the booths[^h5521]: for since the days[^h3117] of Jeshua[^h3442] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126] unto that day[^h3117] had not the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] done so[^h6213]. And there was very[^h3966] great[^h1419] gladness[^h8057].
###### 18
Also day[^h3117] by day[^h3117], from the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] unto the last[^h314] day[^h3117], he read[^h7121] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of God[^h430]. And they kept[^h6213] the feast[^h2282] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]; and on the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117] was a solemn assembly[^h6116], according unto the manner[^h4941].

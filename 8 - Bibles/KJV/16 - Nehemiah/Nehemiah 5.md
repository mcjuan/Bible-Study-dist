###### 1
And there was a great[^h1419] cry[^h6818] of the people[^h5971] and of their wives[^h802] against their brethren[^h251] the Jews[^h3064].
###### 2
For there were[^h3426] that said[^h559], We, our sons[^h1121], and our daughters[^h1323], are many[^h7227]: therefore we take up[^h3947] corn[^h1715] for them, that we may eat[^h398], and live[^h2421].
###### 3
Some also there were[^h3426] that said[^h559], We have mortgaged[^h6148] our lands[^h7704], vineyards[^h3754], and houses[^h1004], that we might buy[^h3947] corn[^h1715], because of the dearth[^h7458].
###### 4
There were[^h3426] also that said[^h559], We have borrowed[^h3867] money[^h3701] for the king's[^h4428] tribute[^h4060], and that upon our lands[^h7704] and vineyards[^h3754].
###### 5
Yet now our flesh[^h1320] is as the flesh[^h1320] of our brethren[^h251], our children[^h1121] as their children[^h1121]: and, lo, we bring into bondage[^h3533] our sons[^h1121] and our daughters[^h1323] to be servants[^h5650], and some of our daughters[^h1323] are[^h3426] brought unto bondage[^h3533] already: neither is it in our power[^h410] [^h3027] to redeem them; for other men[^h312] have our lands[^h7704] and vineyards[^h3754].
###### 6
And I was very[^h3966] angry[^h2734] when I heard[^h8085] their cry[^h2201] and these words[^h1697].
###### 7
Then I consulted[^h4427] with myself[^h3820], and I rebuked[^h7378] the nobles[^h2715], and the rulers[^h5461], and said[^h559] unto them, Ye exact[^h5378] [^h5383] [^h5375] usury[^h4855], every one[^h376] of his brother[^h251]. And I set[^h5414] a great[^h1419] assembly[^h6952] against them. 
###### 8
And I said[^h559] unto them, We after our ability[^h1767] have redeemed[^h7069] our brethren[^h251] the Jews[^h3064], which were sold[^h4376] unto the heathen[^h1471]; and will ye even sell[^h4376] your brethren[^h251]? or shall they be sold[^h4376] unto us? Then held they their peace[^h2790], and found[^h4672] nothing[^h1697] to answer.
###### 9
Also I said[^h559], It is not good[^h2896] that[^h1697] ye do[^h6213]: ought ye not to walk[^h3212] in the fear[^h3374] of our God[^h430] because of the reproach[^h2781] of the heathen[^h1471] our enemies[^h341]?
###### 10
I likewise, and my brethren[^h251], and my servants[^h5288], might exact[^h5383] of them money[^h3701] and corn[^h1715]: I pray you, let us leave off[^h5800] this usury[^h4855].
###### 11
Restore[^h7725], I pray you, to them, even this day[^h3117], their lands[^h7704], their vineyards[^h3754], their oliveyards[^h2132], and their houses[^h1004], also the hundredth[^h3967] part of the money[^h3701], and of the corn[^h1715], the wine[^h8492], and the oil[^h3323], that ye exact[^h5383] of them.
###### 12
Then said[^h559] they, We will restore[^h7725] them, and will require[^h1245] nothing of them; so will we do[^h6213] as thou sayest[^h559]. Then I called[^h7121] the priests[^h3548], and took an oath[^h7650] of them, that they should do[^h6213] according to this promise[^h1697].
###### 13
Also I shook[^h5287] my lap[^h2684], and said[^h559], So God[^h430] shake out[^h5287] every man[^h376] from his house[^h1004], and from his labour[^h3018], that performeth[^h6965] not this promise[^h1697], even thus be he shaken out[^h5287], and emptied[^h7386]. And all the congregation[^h6951] said[^h559], Amen[^h543], and praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068]. And the people[^h5971] did[^h6213] according to this promise[^h1697]. 
###### 14
Moreover from the time[^h3117] that I was appointed[^h6680] to be their governor[^h6346] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], from the twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] even unto the two[^h8147] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of Artaxerxes[^h783] the king[^h4428], that is, twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] years[^h8141], I and my brethren[^h251] have not eaten[^h398] the bread[^h3899] of the governor[^h6346].
###### 15
But the former[^h7223] governors[^h6346] that had been before[^h6440] me were chargeable[^h3513] unto the people[^h5971], and had taken[^h3947] of them bread[^h3899] and wine[^h3196], beside[^h310] forty[^h705] shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701]; yea, even[^h1571] their servants[^h5288] bare rule[^h7980] over the people[^h5971]: but so did[^h6213] not I, because[^h6440] of the fear[^h3374] of God[^h430].
###### 16
Yea, also I continued[^h2388] in the work[^h4399] of this wall[^h2346], neither bought[^h7069] we any land[^h7704]: and all my servants[^h5288] were gathered[^h6908] thither unto the work[^h4399].
###### 17
Moreover there were at my table[^h7979] an hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] [^h376] of the Jews[^h3064] and rulers[^h5461], beside those that came[^h935] unto us from among the heathen[^h1471] that are about us[^h5439].
###### 18
Now that which was prepared[^h6213] for me daily[^h3117] was one[^h259] ox[^h7794] and six[^h8337] choice[^h1305] sheep[^h6629]; also fowls[^h6833] were prepared[^h6213] for me, and once in ten[^h6235] days[^h3117] store[^h7235] of all sorts of wine[^h3196]: yet for all[^h5973] this required[^h1245] not I the bread[^h3899] of the governor[^h6346], because the bondage[^h5656] was heavy[^h3513] upon this people[^h5971].
###### 19
Think[^h2142] upon me, my God[^h430], for good[^h2896], according to all that I have done[^h6213] for this people[^h5971].

###### 1
Now it came to pass, when Sanballat[^h5571], and Tobiah[^h2900], and Geshem[^h1654] the Arabian[^h6163], and the rest[^h3499] of our enemies[^h341], heard[^h8085] that I had builded[^h1129] the wall[^h2346], and that there was no breach[^h6556] left[^h3498] therein; (though[^h1571] [^h5704] at that time[^h6256] I had not set up[^h5975] the doors[^h1817] upon the gates[^h8179];)
###### 2
That Sanballat[^h5571] and Geshem[^h1654] sent[^h7971] unto me, saying[^h559], Come[^h3212], let us meet[^h3259] together[^h3162] in some one of the villages[^h3715] in the plain[^h1237] of Ono[^h207]. But they thought[^h2803] to do[^h6213] me mischief[^h7451].
###### 3
And I sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto them, saying[^h559], I am doing[^h6213] a great[^h1419] work[^h4399], so that I cannot[^h3201] come down[^h3381]: why should the work[^h4399] cease[^h7673], whilst[^h834] I leave[^h7503] it, and come down[^h3381] to you?
###### 4
Yet they sent[^h7971] unto me four[^h702] times[^h6471] after this sort[^h1697]; and I answered[^h7725] them after the same manner[^h1697].
###### 5
Then sent[^h7971] Sanballat[^h5571] his servant[^h5288] unto me in like manner[^h1697] the fifth[^h2549] time[^h6471] with an open[^h6605] letter[^h107] in his hand[^h3027];
###### 6
Wherein was written[^h3789], It is reported[^h8085] among the heathen[^h1471], and Gashmu[^h1654] saith[^h559] it, that thou and the Jews[^h3064] think[^h2803] to rebel[^h4775]: for which cause[^h3651] thou buildest[^h1129] the wall[^h2346], that thou mayest be[^h1933] their king[^h4428], according to these words[^h1697]. 
###### 7
And thou hast also appointed[^h5975] prophets[^h5030] to preach[^h7121] of thee at Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], There is a king[^h4428] in Judah[^h3063]: and now shall it be reported[^h8085] to the king[^h4428] according to these words[^h1697]. Come[^h3212] now therefore, and let us take counsel[^h3289] together[^h3162].
###### 8
Then I sent[^h7971] unto him, saying[^h559], There are[^h1961] no such things[^h1697] done[^h1961] as thou sayest[^h559], but thou feignest[^h908] them out of thine own heart[^h3820].
###### 9
For they all made us afraid[^h3372], saying[^h559], Their hands[^h3027] shall be weakened[^h7503] from the work[^h4399], that it be not done[^h6213]. Now therefore, O God, strengthen[^h2388] my hands[^h3027].
###### 10
Afterward I came[^h935] unto the house[^h1004] of Shemaiah[^h8098] the son[^h1121] of Delaiah[^h1806] the son[^h1121] of Mehetabeel[^h4105], who was shut up[^h6113]; and he said[^h559], Let us meet together[^h3259] in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], within[^h8432] the temple[^h1964], and let us shut[^h5462] the doors[^h1817] of the temple[^h1964]: for they will come[^h935] to slay[^h2026] thee; yea, in the night[^h3915] will they come[^h935] to slay[^h2026] thee.
###### 11
And I said[^h559], Should such[^h3644] a man[^h376] as I flee[^h1272]? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go[^h935] into the temple[^h1964] to save his life[^h2425]? I will not go in[^h935].
###### 12
And, lo, I perceived[^h5234] that God[^h430] had not sent[^h7971] him; but that he pronounced[^h1696] this prophecy[^h5016] against me: for Tobiah[^h2900] and Sanballat[^h5571] had hired[^h7936] him.
###### 13
Therefore was he hired[^h7936], that I should be afraid[^h3372], and do so[^h6213], and sin[^h2398], and that they might have matter for an evil[^h7451] report[^h8034], that they might reproach[^h2778] me.
###### 14
My God[^h430], think[^h2142] thou upon Tobiah[^h2900] and Sanballat[^h5571] according to these their works[^h4639], and on the prophetess[^h5031] Noadiah[^h5129], and the rest[^h3499] of the prophets[^h5030], that would have put me in fear[^h3372].
###### 15
So the wall[^h2346] was finished[^h7999] in the twenty[^h6242] and fifth[^h2568] day of the month Elul[^h435], in fifty[^h2572] and two[^h8147] days[^h3117].
###### 16
And it came to pass, that when all our enemies[^h341] heard[^h8085] thereof, and all the heathen[^h1471] that were about us[^h5439] saw[^h7200] these things, they were much[^h3966] cast down[^h5307] in their own eyes[^h5869]: for they perceived[^h3045] that this work[^h4399] was wrought[^h6213] of our God[^h430].
###### 17
Moreover in those days[^h3117] the nobles[^h2715] of Judah[^h3063] sent[^h1980] many[^h7235] letters[^h107] unto Tobiah[^h2900], and the letters of Tobiah[^h2900] came[^h935] unto them. 
###### 18
For there were many[^h7227] in Judah[^h3063] sworn[^h1167] [^h7621] unto him, because he was the son in law[^h2860] of Shechaniah[^h7935] the son[^h1121] of Arah[^h733]; and his son[^h1121] Johanan[^h3076] had taken[^h3947] the daughter[^h1323] of Meshullam[^h4918] the son[^h1121] of Berechiah[^h1296].
###### 19
Also they reported[^h559] his good deeds[^h2896] before[^h6440] me, and uttered[^h3318] my words[^h1697] to him. And Tobiah[^h2900] sent[^h7971] letters[^h107] to put me in fear[^h3372].

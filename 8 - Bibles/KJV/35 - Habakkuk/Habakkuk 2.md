###### 1
I will stand[^h5975] upon my watch[^h4931], and set[^h3320] me upon the tower[^h4692], and will watch[^h6822] to see[^h7200] what he will say[^h1696] unto me, and what I shall answer[^h7725] when I am reproved[^h8433].   
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] me, and said[^h559], Write[^h3789] the vision[^h2377], and make it plain[^h874] upon tables[^h3871], that he may run[^h7323] that readeth[^h7121] it.
###### 3
For the vision[^h2377] is yet for an appointed time[^h4150], but at the end[^h7093] it shall speak[^h6315], and not lie[^h3576]: though it tarry[^h4102], wait[^h2442] for it; because it will surely[^h935] come[^h935], it will not tarry[^h309].
###### 4
Behold, his soul[^h5315] which is lifted up[^h6075] is not upright[^h3474] in him: but the just[^h6662] shall live[^h2421] by his faith[^h530].
###### 5
Yea also, because he transgresseth[^h898] by wine[^h3196], he is a proud[^h3093] man[^h1397], neither keepeth at home[^h5115], who enlargeth[^h7337] his desire[^h5315] as hell[^h7585], and is as death[^h4194], and cannot be satisfied[^h7646], but gathereth[^h622] unto him all nations[^h1471], and heapeth[^h6908] unto him all people[^h5971]: 
###### 6
Shall not all these take up[^h5375] a parable[^h4912] against him, and a taunting[^h4426] proverb[^h2420] against him, and say[^h559], Woe[^h1945] to him that increaseth[^h7235] that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth[^h3513] himself with thick clay[^h5671]! 
###### 7
Shall they not rise up[^h6965] suddenly[^h6621] that shall bite[^h5391] thee, and awake[^h3364] that shall vex[^h2111] thee, and thou shalt be for booties[^h4933] unto them?
###### 8
Because thou hast spoiled[^h7997] many[^h7227] nations[^h1471], all the remnant[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] shall spoil[^h7997] thee; because of men's[^h120] blood[^h1818], and for the violence[^h2555] of the land[^h776], of the city[^h7151], and of all that dwell[^h3427] therein. 
###### 9
Woe[^h1945] to him that coveteth[^h1214] an evil[^h7451] covetousness[^h1215] to his house[^h1004], that he may set[^h7760] his nest[^h7064] on high[^h4791], that he may be delivered[^h5337] from the power[^h3709] of evil[^h7451]!  
###### 10
Thou hast consulted[^h3289] shame[^h1322] to thy house[^h1004] by cutting off[^h7096] many[^h7227] people[^h5971], and hast sinned[^h2398] against thy soul[^h5315].
###### 11
For the stone[^h68] shall cry out[^h2199] of the wall[^h7023], and the beam out[^h3714] of the timber[^h6086] shall answer[^h6030] it.  
###### 12
Woe[^h1945] to him that buildeth[^h1129] a town[^h5892] with blood[^h1818], and stablisheth[^h3559] a city[^h7151] by iniquity[^h5766]! 
###### 13
Behold, is it not of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] that the people[^h5971] shall labour[^h3021] in the very[^h1767] fire[^h784], and the people[^h3816] shall weary[^h3286] themselves for very[^h1767] vanity[^h7385]? 
###### 14
For the earth[^h776] shall be filled[^h4390] with the knowledge[^h3045] of the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068], as the waters[^h4325] cover[^h3680] the sea[^h3220]. 
###### 15
Woe[^h1945] unto him that giveth his neighbour[^h7453] drink[^h8248], that puttest[^h5596] thy bottle[^h2573] to him, and makest him drunken[^h7937] also, that thou mayest look[^h5027] on their nakedness[^h4589]!
###### 16
Thou art filled[^h7646] with shame[^h7036] for glory[^h3519]: drink[^h8354] thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered[^h6188]: the cup[^h3563] of the LORD'S[^h3068] right hand[^h3225] shall be turned[^h5437] unto thee, and shameful spewing[^h7022] shall be on thy glory[^h3519]. 
###### 17
For the violence[^h2555] of Lebanon[^h3844] shall cover[^h3680] thee, and the spoil[^h7701] of beasts[^h929], which made them afraid[^h2865], because of men's[^h120] blood[^h1818], and for the violence[^h2555] of the land[^h776], of the city[^h7151], and of all that dwell[^h3427] therein.
###### 18
What profiteth[^h3276] the graven image[^h6459] that the maker[^h3335] thereof hath graven[^h6458] it; the molten image[^h4541], and a teacher[^h3384] of lies[^h8267], that the maker[^h3335] of his work[^h3336] trusteth[^h982] therein, to make[^h6213] dumb[^h483] idols[^h457]? 
###### 19
Woe[^h1945] unto him that saith[^h559] to the wood[^h6086], Awake[^h6974]; to the dumb[^h1748] stone[^h68], Arise[^h5782], it shall teach[^h3384]! Behold, it is laid[^h8610] over with gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701], and there is no breath[^h7307] at all in the midst[^h7130] of it.
###### 20
But the LORD[^h3068] is in his holy[^h6944] temple[^h1964]: let all the earth[^h776] keep silence[^h2013] before[^h6440] him.

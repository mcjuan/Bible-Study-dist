###### 1
So Abijah[^h29] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Asa[^h609] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead. In his days[^h3117] the land[^h776] was quiet[^h8252] ten[^h6235] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And Asa[^h609] did[^h6213] that which was good[^h2896] and right[^h3477] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430]:
###### 3
For he took away[^h5493] the altars[^h4196] of the strange[^h5236] gods, and the high places[^h1116], and brake down[^h7665] the images[^h4676], and cut down[^h1438] the groves[^h842]: 
###### 4
And commanded[^h559] Judah[^h3063] to seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], and to do[^h6213] the law[^h8451] and the commandment[^h4687].
###### 5
Also he took away[^h5493] out of all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] the high places[^h1116] and the images[^h2553]: and the kingdom[^h4467] was quiet[^h8252] before[^h6440] him. 
###### 6
And he built[^h1129] fenced[^h4694] cities[^h5892] in Judah[^h3063]: for the land[^h776] had rest[^h8252], and he had no war[^h4421] in those years[^h8141]; because the LORD[^h3068] had given him rest[^h5117].
###### 7
Therefore he said[^h559] unto Judah[^h3063], Let us build[^h1129] these cities[^h5892], and make about[^h5437] them walls[^h2346], and towers[^h4026], gates[^h1817], and bars[^h1280], while the land[^h776] is yet before[^h6440] us; because we have sought[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], we have sought[^h1875] him, and he hath given us rest[^h5117] on every side[^h5439]. So they built[^h1129] and prospered[^h6743].
###### 8
And Asa[^h609] had an army[^h2428] of men that bare[^h5375] targets[^h6793] and spears[^h7420], out of Judah[^h3063] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505]; and out of Benjamin[^h1144], that bare[^h5375] shields[^h4043] and drew[^h1869] bows[^h7198], two hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505]: all these were mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428].
###### 9
And there came out[^h3318] against them Zerah[^h2226] the Ethiopian[^h3569] with an host[^h2428] of a thousand[^h505] thousand[^h505], and three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h4818]; and came[^h935] unto Mareshah[^h4762].
###### 10
Then Asa[^h609] went out[^h3318] against[^h6440] him, and they set the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] in the valley[^h1516] of Zephathah[^h6859] at Mareshah[^h4762].
###### 11
And Asa[^h609] cried[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and said[^h559], LORD[^h3068], it is nothing with thee to help[^h5826], whether[^h996] with many[^h7227], or with them that have no power[^h3581]: help[^h5826] us, O LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]; for we rest[^h8172] on thee, and in thy name[^h8034] we go[^h935] against this multitude[^h1995]. O LORD[^h3068], thou art our God[^h430]; let not man[^h582] prevail[^h6113] against thee. 
###### 12
So the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5062] the Ethiopians[^h3569] before[^h6440] Asa[^h609], and before[^h6440] Judah[^h3063]; and the Ethiopians[^h3569] fled[^h5127].
###### 13
And Asa[^h609] and the people[^h5971] that were with him pursued[^h7291] them unto Gerar[^h1642]: and the Ethiopians[^h3569] were overthrown[^h5307], that they could not recover[^h4241] themselves; for they were destroyed[^h7665] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and before[^h6440] his host[^h4264]; and they carried away[^h5375] very[^h3966] much[^h7235] spoil[^h7998]. 
###### 14
And they smote[^h5221] all the cities[^h5892] round about[^h5439] Gerar[^h1642]; for the fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068] came upon them: and they spoiled[^h962] all the cities[^h5892]; for there was exceeding much[^h7227] spoil[^h961] in them.
###### 15
They smote[^h5221] also the tents[^h168] of cattle[^h4735], and carried away[^h7617] sheep[^h6629] and camels[^h1581] in abundance[^h7230], and returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389].

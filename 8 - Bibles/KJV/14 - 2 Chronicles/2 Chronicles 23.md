###### 1
And in the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141] Jehoiada[^h3077] strengthened[^h2388] himself, and took[^h3947] the captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Jeroham[^h3395], and Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Jehohanan[^h3076], and Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Obed[^h5744], and Maaseiah[^h4641] the son[^h1121] of Adaiah[^h5718], and Elishaphat[^h478] the son[^h1121] of Zichri[^h2147], into covenant[^h1285] with him.
###### 2
And they went about[^h5437] in Judah[^h3063], and gathered[^h6908] the Levites[^h3881] out of all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of Israel[^h3478], and they came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And all the congregation[^h6951] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the king[^h4428] in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]. And he said[^h559] unto them, Behold, the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121] shall reign[^h4427], as the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696] of the sons[^h1121] of David[^h1732].
###### 4
This is the thing[^h1697] that ye shall do[^h6213]; A third part[^h7992] of you entering[^h935] on the sabbath[^h7676], of the priests[^h3548] and of the Levites[^h3881], shall be porters[^h7778] of the doors[^h5592]; 
###### 5
And a third part[^h7992] shall be at the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]; and a third part[^h7992] at the gate[^h8179] of the foundation[^h3247]: and all the people[^h5971] shall be in the courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
But let none come[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], save the priests[^h3548], and they that minister[^h8334] of the Levites[^h3881]; they shall go in[^h935], for they are holy[^h6944]: but all the people[^h5971] shall keep[^h8104] the watch[^h4931] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
And the Levites[^h3881] shall compass[^h5362] the king[^h4428] round about[^h5439], every man[^h376] with his weapons[^h3627] in his hand[^h3027]; and whosoever else cometh[^h935] into the house[^h1004], he shall be put to death[^h4191]: but be ye with the king[^h4428] when he cometh in[^h935], and when he goeth out[^h3318].
###### 8
So the Levites[^h3881] and all Judah[^h3063] did[^h6213] according to all things that Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] had commanded[^h6680], and took[^h3947] every man[^h376] his men[^h582] that were to come in[^h935] on the sabbath[^h7676], with them that were to go[^h3318] out on the sabbath[^h7676]: for Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] dismissed[^h6358] not the courses[^h4256].
###### 9
Moreover Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] delivered[^h5414] to the captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967] spears[^h2595], and bucklers[^h4043], and shields[^h7982], that had been king[^h4428] David's[^h1732], which were in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].
###### 10
And he set[^h5975] all the people[^h5971], every man[^h376] having his weapon[^h7973] in his hand[^h3027], from the right[^h3233] side[^h3802] of the temple[^h1004] to the left[^h8042] side[^h3802] of the temple[^h1004], along by the altar[^h4196] and the temple[^h1004], by the king[^h4428] round about[^h5439].  
###### 11
Then they brought out[^h3318] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121], and put[^h5414] upon him the crown[^h5145], and gave him the testimony[^h5715], and made him king[^h4427]. And Jehoiada[^h3077] and his sons[^h1121] anointed[^h4886] him, and said[^h559], God save[^h2421] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 12
Now when Athaliah[^h6271] heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of the people[^h5971] running[^h7323] and praising[^h1984] the king[^h4428], she came[^h935] to the people[^h5971] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 13
And she looked[^h7200], and, behold, the king[^h4428] stood[^h5975] at his pillar[^h5982] at the entering in[^h3996], and the princes[^h8269] and the trumpets[^h2689] by the king[^h4428]: and all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] rejoiced[^h8056], and sounded[^h8628] with trumpets[^h2689], also the singers[^h7891] with instruments[^h3627] of musick[^h7892], and such as taught[^h3045] to sing praise[^h1984]. Then Athaliah[^h6271] rent[^h7167] her clothes[^h899], and said[^h559], Treason[^h7195], Treason[^h7195]. 
###### 14
Then Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548] brought out[^h3318] the captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967] that were set over[^h6485] the host[^h2428], and said[^h559] unto them, Have her forth[^h3318] of the ranges[^h1004] [^h7713]: and whoso followeth[^h935] [^h310] her, let him be slain[^h4191] with the sword[^h2719]. For the priest[^h3548] said[^h559], Slay[^h4191] her not in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
So they laid[^h7760] hands[^h3027] on her; and when she was come[^h935] to the entering[^h3996] of the horse[^h5483] gate[^h8179] by the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], they slew[^h4191] her there.
###### 16
And Jehoiada[^h3077] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] between him, and between all the people[^h5971], and between the king[^h4428], that they should be the LORD'S[^h3068] people[^h5971].
###### 17
Then all the people[^h5971] went[^h935] to the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], and brake it down[^h5422], and brake[^h7665] his altars[^h4196] and his images[^h6754] in pieces[^h7665], and slew[^h2026] Mattan[^h4977] the priest[^h3548] of Baal[^h1168] before[^h6440] the altars[^h4196].
###### 18
Also Jehoiada[^h3077] appointed[^h7760] the offices[^h6486] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] by the hand[^h3027] of the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881], whom David[^h1732] had distributed[^h2505] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], to offer[^h5927] the burnt offerings[^h5930] of the LORD[^h3068], as it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], with rejoicing[^h8057] and with singing[^h7892], as it was ordained by[^h3027] David[^h1732]. 
###### 19
And he set[^h5975] the porters[^h7778] at the gates[^h8179] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], that none which was unclean[^h2931] in any thing[^h1697] should enter in[^h935].
###### 20
And he took[^h3947] the captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], and the nobles[^h117], and the governors[^h4910] of the people[^h5971], and all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], and brought down[^h3381] the king[^h4428] from the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and they came[^h935] through[^h8432] the high[^h5945] gate[^h8179] into the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and set[^h3427] the king[^h4428] upon the throne[^h3678] of the kingdom[^h4467].
###### 21
And all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] rejoiced[^h8055]: and the city[^h5892] was quiet[^h8252], after that they had slain[^h4191] Athaliah[^h6271] with the sword[^h2719].

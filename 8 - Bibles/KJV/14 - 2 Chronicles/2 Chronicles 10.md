###### 1
And Rehoboam[^h7346] went[^h3212] to Shechem[^h7927]: for to Shechem[^h7927] were all Israel[^h3478] come[^h935] to make him king[^h4427].
###### 2
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who was in Egypt[^h4714], whither he had fled[^h1272] from the presence[^h6440] of Solomon[^h8010] the king[^h4428], heard[^h8085] it, that Jeroboam[^h3379] returned[^h7725] out of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 3
And they sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] him. So Jeroboam[^h3379] and all Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] and spake[^h1696] to Rehoboam[^h7346], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Thy father[^h1] made our yoke[^h5923] grievous[^h7185]: now therefore ease[^h7043] thou somewhat the grievous[^h7186] servitude[^h5656] of thy father[^h1], and his heavy[^h3515] yoke[^h5923] that he put[^h5414] upon us, and we will serve[^h5647] thee.
###### 5
And he said[^h559] unto them, Come again[^h7725] unto me after three[^h7969] days[^h3117]. And the people[^h5971] departed[^h3212].
###### 6
And king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] took counsel[^h3289] with the old[^h2205] men that had stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Solomon[^h8010] his father[^h1] while he yet lived[^h2416], saying[^h559], What[^h349] counsel give[^h3289] ye me to return[^h7725] answer[^h1697] to this people[^h5971]?
###### 7
And they spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], If thou be kind[^h2896] to this people[^h5971], and please[^h7521] them, and speak[^h1696] good[^h2896] words[^h1697] to them, they will be thy servants[^h5650] for ever[^h3117].
###### 8
But he forsook[^h5800] the counsel[^h6098] which the old men[^h2205] gave[^h3289] him, and took counsel[^h3289] with the young men[^h3206] that were brought up[^h1431] with him, that stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him.
###### 9
And he said[^h559] unto them, What advice[^h3289] give ye that we may return[^h7725] answer[^h1697] to this people[^h5971], which have spoken[^h1696] to me, saying[^h559], Ease[^h7043] somewhat the yoke[^h5923] that thy father[^h1] did put[^h5414] upon us?
###### 10
And the young men[^h3206] that were brought up[^h1431] with him spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], Thus shalt thou answer[^h559] the people[^h5971] that spake[^h1696] unto thee, saying[^h559], Thy father[^h1] made[^h3513] our yoke[^h5923] heavy[^h3513], but make thou it somewhat lighter[^h7043] for us; thus shalt thou say[^h559] unto them, My little[^h6995] finger shall be thicker[^h5666] than my father's[^h1] loins[^h4975].
###### 11
For whereas[^h6258] my father[^h1] put[^h6006] a heavy[^h3515] yoke[^h5923] upon you, I will put more[^h3254] to your yoke[^h5923]: my father[^h1] chastised[^h3256] you with whips[^h7752], but I will chastise you with scorpions[^h6137]. 
###### 12
So Jeroboam[^h3379] and all the people[^h5971] came[^h935] to Rehoboam[^h7346] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], as the king[^h4428] bade[^h1696], saying[^h559], Come again[^h7725] to me on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117].
###### 13
And the king[^h4428] answered[^h6030] them roughly[^h7186]; and king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] forsook[^h5800] the counsel[^h6098] of the old men[^h2205],
###### 14
And answered[^h1696] them after the advice[^h6098] of the young men[^h3206], saying[^h559], My father[^h1] made your yoke[^h5923] heavy[^h3513], but I will add[^h3254] thereto: my father[^h1] chastised[^h3256] you with whips[^h7752], but I will chastise you with scorpions[^h6137].
###### 15
So the king[^h4428] hearkened[^h8085] not unto the people[^h5971]: for the cause[^h5252] was of God[^h430], that the LORD[^h3068] might perform[^h6965] his word[^h1697], which he spake[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of Ahijah[^h281] the Shilonite[^h7888] to Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028].
###### 16
And when all Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that the king[^h4428] would not hearken[^h8085] unto them, the people[^h5971] answered[^h7725] the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], What portion[^h2506] have we in David[^h1732]? and we have none inheritance[^h5159] in the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448]: every man[^h376] to your tents[^h168], O Israel[^h3478]: and now, David[^h1732], see[^h7200] to thine own house[^h1004]. So all Israel[^h3478] went[^h3212] to their tents[^h168].
###### 17
But as for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] that dwelt[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], Rehoboam[^h7346] reigned[^h4427] over them.
###### 18
Then king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] sent[^h7971] Hadoram[^h1913] that was over the tribute[^h4522]; and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] stoned[^h7275] him with stones[^h68], that he died[^h4191]. But king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] made speed[^h553] to get him up[^h5927] to his chariot[^h4818], to flee[^h5127] to Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 19
And Israel[^h3478] rebelled[^h6586] against the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] unto this day[^h3117].

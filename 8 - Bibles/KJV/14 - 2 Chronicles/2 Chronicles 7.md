###### 1
Now when Solomon[^h8010] had made an end[^h3615] of praying[^h6419], the fire[^h784] came down[^h3381] from heaven[^h8064], and consumed[^h398] the burnt offering[^h5930] and the sacrifices[^h2077]; and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004].
###### 2
And the priests[^h3548] could[^h3201] not enter[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], because the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] had filled[^h4390] the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004].
###### 3
And when all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] how the fire[^h784] came down[^h3381], and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] upon the house[^h1004], they bowed[^h3766] themselves with their faces[^h639] to the ground[^h776] upon the pavement[^h7531], and worshipped[^h7812], and praised[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068], saying, For he is good[^h2896]; for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769].
###### 4
Then the king[^h4428] and all the people[^h5971] offered[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] offered[^h2076] a sacrifice[^h2077] of twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] thousand[^h505] oxen[^h1241], and an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629]: so the king[^h4428] and all the people[^h5971] dedicated[^h2596] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].
###### 6
And the priests[^h3548] waited[^h5975] on their offices[^h4931]: the Levites[^h3881] also with instruments[^h3627] of musick[^h7892] of the LORD[^h3068], which David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] had made[^h6213] to praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068], because his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769], when David[^h1732] praised[^h1984] by their ministry[^h3027]; and the priests[^h3548] sounded trumpets[^h2690] [^h2690] before them, and all Israel[^h3478] stood[^h5975]. 
###### 7
Moreover Solomon[^h8010] hallowed[^h6942] the middle[^h8432] of the court[^h2691] that was before[^h6440] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: for there he offered[^h6213] burnt offerings[^h5930], and the fat[^h2459] of the peace offerings[^h8002], because the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196] which Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213] was not able[^h3201] to receive[^h3557] the burnt offerings[^h5930], and the meat offerings[^h4503], and the fat[^h2459].
###### 8
Also at the same time[^h6256] Solomon[^h8010] kept[^h6213] the feast[^h2282] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] congregation[^h6951], from the entering in[^h935] of Hamath[^h2574] unto the river[^h5158] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 9
And in the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117] they made[^h6213] a solemn assembly[^h6116]: for they kept[^h6213] the dedication[^h2598] of the altar[^h4196] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], and the feast[^h2282] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]. 
###### 10
And on the three[^h7969] and twentieth[^h6242] day[^h3117] of the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320] he sent[^h7971] the people[^h5971] away[^h7971] into their tents[^h168], glad[^h8056] and merry[^h2896] in heart[^h3820] for the goodness[^h2896] that the LORD[^h3068] had shewed[^h6213] unto David[^h1732], and to Solomon[^h8010], and to Israel[^h3478] his people[^h5971].
###### 11
Thus Solomon[^h8010] finished[^h3615] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]: and all that came[^h935] into Solomon's[^h8010] heart[^h3820] to make[^h6213] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in his own house[^h1004], he prosperously effected[^h6743].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] to Solomon[^h8010] by night[^h3915], and said[^h559] unto him, I have heard[^h8085] thy prayer[^h8605], and have chosen[^h977] this place[^h4725] to myself for an house[^h1004] of sacrifice[^h2077].
###### 13
If[^h2005] I shut up[^h6113] heaven[^h8064] that there be no rain[^h4306], or if I command[^h6680] the locusts[^h2284] to devour[^h398] the land[^h776], or if I send[^h7971] pestilence[^h1698] among my people[^h5971];
###### 14
If my people[^h5971], which are called[^h7121] by my name[^h8034], shall humble[^h3665] themselves, and pray[^h6419], and seek[^h1245] my face[^h6440], and turn[^h7725] from their wicked[^h7451] ways[^h1870]; then will I hear[^h8085] from heaven[^h8064], and will forgive[^h5545] their sin[^h2403], and will heal[^h7495] their land[^h776]. 
###### 15
Now mine eyes[^h5869] shall be open[^h6605], and mine ears[^h241] attent[^h7183] unto the prayer[^h8605] that is made in this place[^h4725]. 
###### 16
For now have I chosen[^h977] and sanctified[^h6942] this house[^h1004], that my name[^h8034] may be there for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]: and mine eyes[^h5869] and mine heart[^h3820] shall be there perpetually[^h3117].
###### 17
And as for thee, if thou wilt walk[^h3212] before[^h6440] me, as David[^h1732] thy father[^h1] walked[^h1980], and do[^h6213] according to all that I have commanded[^h6680] thee, and shalt observe[^h8104] my statutes[^h2706] and my judgments[^h4941];
###### 18
Then will I stablish[^h6965] the throne[^h3678] of thy kingdom[^h4438], according as I have covenanted[^h3772] with David[^h1732] thy father[^h1], saying[^h559], There shall not fail[^h3772] thee a man[^h376] to be ruler[^h4910] in Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 19
But if ye turn away[^h7725], and forsake[^h5800] my statutes[^h2708] and my commandments[^h4687], which I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you, and shall go[^h1980] and serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worship[^h7812] them;
###### 20
Then will I pluck them up by the roots[^h5428] out of my land[^h127] which I have given[^h5414] them; and this house[^h1004], which I have sanctified[^h6942] for my name[^h8034], will I cast out[^h7993] of my sight[^h6440], and will make[^h5414] it to be a proverb[^h4912] and a byword[^h8148] among all nations[^h5971].
###### 21
And this house[^h1004], which is high[^h5945], shall be an astonishment[^h8074] to every one that passeth[^h5674] by it; so that he shall say[^h559], Why hath the LORD[^h3068] done[^h6213] thus unto this land[^h776], and unto this house[^h1004]?
###### 22
And it shall be answered[^h559], Because they forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], which brought them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and laid hold[^h2388] on other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worshipped[^h7812] them, and served[^h5647] them: therefore hath he brought[^h935] all this evil[^h7451] upon them.

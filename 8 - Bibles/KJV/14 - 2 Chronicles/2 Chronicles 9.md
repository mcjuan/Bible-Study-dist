###### 1
And when the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] heard[^h8085] of the fame[^h8088] of Solomon[^h8010], she came[^h935] to prove[^h5254] Solomon[^h8010] with hard questions[^h2420] at Jerusalem[^h3389], with a very[^h3966] great[^h3515] company[^h2428], and camels[^h1581] that bare[^h5375] spices[^h1314], and gold[^h2091] in abundance[^h7230], and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68]: and when she was come[^h935] to Solomon[^h8010], she communed[^h1696] with him of all that was in her heart[^h3824].
###### 2
And Solomon[^h8010] told[^h5046] her all her questions[^h1697]: and there was nothing hid[^h5956] from Solomon[^h8010] which he told[^h5046] her not.
###### 3
And when the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] had seen[^h7200] the wisdom[^h2451] of Solomon[^h8010], and the house[^h1004] that he had built[^h1129],
###### 4
And the meat[^h3978] of his table[^h7979], and the sitting[^h4186] of his servants[^h5650], and the attendance[^h4612] of his ministers[^h8334], and their apparel[^h4403]; his cupbearers[^h8248] also, and their apparel[^h4403]; and his ascent[^h5944] by which he went up[^h5927] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; there was no more spirit[^h7307] in her. 
###### 5
And she said[^h559] to the king[^h4428], It was a true[^h571] report[^h1697] which I heard[^h8085] in mine own land[^h776] of thine acts[^h1697], and of thy wisdom[^h2451]:  
###### 6
Howbeit I believed[^h539] not their words[^h1697], until I came[^h935], and mine eyes[^h5869] had seen[^h7200] it: and, behold, the one half[^h2677] of the greatness[^h4768] of thy wisdom[^h2451] was not told[^h5046] me: for thou exceedest[^h3254] the fame[^h8052] that I heard[^h8085].
###### 7
Happy[^h835] are thy men[^h582], and happy[^h835] are these thy servants[^h5650], which stand[^h5975] continually[^h8548] before[^h6440] thee, and hear[^h8085] thy wisdom[^h2451].
###### 8
Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], which delighted[^h2654] in thee to set[^h5414] thee on his throne[^h3678], to be king[^h4428] for the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]: because thy God[^h430] loved[^h160] Israel[^h3478], to establish[^h5975] them for ever[^h5769], therefore made[^h5414] he thee king[^h4428] over them, to do[^h6213] judgment[^h4941] and justice[^h6666].
###### 9
And she gave[^h5414] the king[^h4428] an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], and of spices[^h1314] great[^h3966] abundance[^h7230], and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68]: neither was there any such spice[^h1314] as the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] gave[^h5414] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].
###### 10
And the servants[^h5650] also of Huram[^h2361], and the servants[^h5650] of Solomon[^h8010], which brought[^h935] gold[^h2091] from Ophir[^h211], brought[^h935] algum[^h418] trees[^h6086] and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68].
###### 11
And the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] of the algum[^h418] trees[^h6086] terraces[^h4546] to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and to the king's[^h4428] palace[^h1004], and harps[^h3658] and psalteries[^h5035] for singers[^h7891]: and there were none such[^h1992] seen[^h7200] before[^h6440] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063]. 
###### 12
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] gave[^h5414] to the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] all her desire[^h2656], whatsoever she asked[^h7592], beside that which she had brought[^h935] unto the king[^h4428]. So she turned[^h2015], and went away[^h3212] to her own land[^h776], she and her servants[^h5650].
###### 13
Now the weight[^h4948] of gold[^h2091] that came[^h935] to Solomon[^h8010] in one[^h259] year[^h8141] was six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] and threescore[^h8346] and six[^h8337] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091];
###### 14
Beside that which chapmen[^h582] [^h8446] and merchants[^h5503] brought[^h935]. And all the kings[^h4428] of Arabia[^h6152] and governors[^h6346] of the country[^h776] brought[^h935] gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701] to Solomon[^h8010]. 
###### 15
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] two hundred[^h3967] targets[^h6793] of beaten[^h7820] gold[^h2091]: six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels of beaten[^h7820] gold[^h2091] went[^h5927] to one[^h259] target[^h6793].
###### 16
And three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] shields[^h4043] made he of beaten[^h7820] gold[^h2091]: three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] shekels of gold[^h2091] went[^h5927] to one[^h259] shield[^h4043]. And the king[^h4428] put[^h5414] them in the house[^h1004] of the forest[^h3293] of Lebanon[^h3844].
###### 17
Moreover the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] a great[^h1419] throne[^h3678] of ivory[^h8127], and overlaid[^h6823] it with pure[^h2889] gold[^h2091].
###### 18
And there were six[^h8337] steps[^h4609] to the throne[^h3678], with a footstool[^h3534] of gold[^h2091], which were fastened[^h270] to the throne[^h3678], and stays[^h3027] on each side of the sitting[^h3427] place[^h4725], and two[^h8147] lions[^h738] standing[^h5975] by[^h681] the stays[^h3027]: 
###### 19
And twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] lions[^h738] stood[^h5975] there on the one side and on the other upon the six[^h8337] steps[^h4609]. There was not the like made[^h6213] in any kingdom[^h4467].
###### 20
And all the drinking[^h4945] vessels[^h3627] of king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] were of gold[^h2091], and all the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of the forest[^h3293] of Lebanon[^h3844] were of pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091]: none were of silver[^h3701]; it was not any[^h3972] thing accounted[^h2803] of in the days[^h3117] of Solomon[^h8010].  
###### 21
For the king's[^h4428] ships[^h591] went[^h1980] to Tarshish[^h8659] with the servants[^h5650] of Huram[^h2361]: every three[^h7969] years[^h8141] once[^h259] came[^h935] the ships[^h591] of Tarshish[^h8659] bringing[^h5375] gold[^h2091], and silver[^h3701], ivory[^h8143], and apes[^h6971], and peacocks[^h8500]. 
###### 22
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] passed[^h1431] all the kings[^h4428] of the earth[^h776] in riches[^h6239] and wisdom[^h2451].
###### 23
And all the kings[^h4428] of the earth[^h776] sought[^h1245] the presence[^h6440] of Solomon[^h8010], to hear[^h8085] his wisdom[^h2451], that God[^h430] had put[^h5414] in his heart[^h3820].
###### 24
And they brought[^h935] every man[^h376] his present[^h4503], vessels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], and vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], and raiment[^h8008], harness[^h5402], and spices[^h1314], horses[^h5483], and mules[^h6505], a rate[^h1697] year[^h8141] by year[^h8141].
###### 25
And Solomon[^h8010] had four[^h702] thousand[^h505] stalls[^h723] for horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h4818], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571]; whom he bestowed[^h3240] in the chariot[^h7393] cities[^h5892], and with the king[^h4428] at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 26
And he reigned[^h4910] over all the kings[^h4428] from the river[^h5104] even unto the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430], and to the border[^h1366] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 27
And the king[^h4428] made[^h5414] silver[^h3701] in Jerusalem[^h3389] as stones[^h68], and cedar trees[^h730] made[^h5414] he as the sycomore trees[^h8256] that are in the low plains[^h8219] in abundance[^h7230]. 
###### 28
And they brought[^h3318] unto Solomon[^h8010] horses[^h5483] out of Egypt[^h4714], and out of all lands[^h776].
###### 29
Now the rest[^h7605] of the acts[^h1697] of Solomon[^h8010], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h1697] of Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and in the prophecy[^h5016] of Ahijah[^h281] the Shilonite[^h7888], and in the visions[^h2378] of Iddo[^h3260] the seer[^h2374] against Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028]? 
###### 30
And Solomon[^h8010] reigned[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] over all Israel[^h3478] forty[^h705] years[^h8141].
###### 31
And Solomon[^h8010] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and he was buried[^h6912] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: and Rehoboam[^h7346] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

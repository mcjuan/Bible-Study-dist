###### 1
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141], wherein Solomon[^h8010] had built[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and his own house[^h1004],
###### 2
That the cities[^h5892] which Huram[^h2361] had restored[^h5414] to Solomon[^h8010], Solomon[^h8010] built[^h1129] them, and caused the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] to dwell[^h3427] there.
###### 3
And Solomon[^h8010] went[^h3212] to Hamathzobah[^h2578], and prevailed[^h2388] against it.
###### 4
And he built[^h1129] Tadmor[^h8412] in the wilderness[^h4057], and all the store[^h4543] cities[^h5892], which he built[^h1129] in Hamath[^h2574].
###### 5
Also he built[^h1129] Bethhoron[^h1032] the upper[^h5945], and Bethhoron[^h1032] the nether[^h8481], fenced[^h4692] cities[^h5892], with walls[^h2346], gates[^h1817], and bars[^h1280];
###### 6
And Baalath[^h1191], and all the store[^h4543] cities[^h5892] that Solomon[^h8010] had, and all the chariot[^h7393] cities[^h5892], and the cities[^h5892] of the horsemen[^h6571], and all that Solomon[^h8010] desired[^h2836] [^h2837] to build[^h1129] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and in Lebanon[^h3844], and throughout all the land[^h776] of his dominion[^h4475]. 
###### 7
As for all the people[^h5971] that were left[^h3498] of the Hittites[^h2850], and the Amorites[^h567], and the Perizzites[^h6522], and the Hivites[^h2340], and the Jebusites[^h2983], which were not of Israel[^h3478],
###### 8
But of their children[^h1121], who were left[^h3498] after[^h310] them in the land[^h776], whom the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] consumed[^h3615] not, them did Solomon[^h8010] make to pay[^h5927] tribute[^h4522] until this day[^h3117].
###### 9
But of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did Solomon[^h8010] make[^h5414] no servants[^h5650] for his work[^h4399]; but they were men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and chief[^h8269] of his captains[^h7991], and captains[^h8269] of his chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571].
###### 10
And these were the chief[^h8269] of king[^h4428] Solomon's[^h8010] officers[^h5324] [^h5333], even two hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572], that bare rule[^h7287] over the people[^h5971].
###### 11
And Solomon[^h8010] brought up[^h5927] the daughter[^h1323] of Pharaoh[^h6547] out of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] unto the house[^h1004] that he had built[^h1129] for her: for he said[^h559], My wife[^h802] shall not dwell[^h3427] in the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], because the places are holy[^h6944], whereunto the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] hath come[^h935]. 
###### 12
Then Solomon[^h8010] offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068] on the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], which he had built[^h1129] before[^h6440] the porch[^h197],
###### 13
Even after a certain rate[^h1697] every day[^h3117], offering[^h5927] according to the commandment[^h4687] of Moses[^h4872], on the sabbaths[^h7676], and on the new moons[^h2320], and on the solemn feasts[^h4150], three[^h7969] times[^h6471] in the year[^h8141], even in the feast[^h2282] of unleavened bread[^h4682], and in the feast[^h2282] of weeks[^h7620], and in the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521].
###### 14
And he appointed[^h5975], according to the order[^h4941] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1], the courses[^h4256] of the priests[^h3548] to their service[^h5656], and the Levites[^h3881] to their charges[^h4931], to praise[^h1984] and minister[^h8334] before the priests[^h3548], as the duty[^h1697] of every day[^h3117] required[^h3117]: the porters[^h7778] also by their courses[^h4256] at every gate[^h8179]: for so had David[^h1732] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] commanded[^h4687]. 
###### 15
And they departed[^h5493] not from the commandment[^h4687] of the king[^h4428] unto the priests[^h3548] and Levites[^h3881] concerning any matter[^h1697], or concerning the treasures[^h214].
###### 16
Now all the work[^h4399] of Solomon[^h8010] was prepared[^h3559] unto the day[^h3117] of the foundation[^h4143] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and until it was finished[^h3615]. So the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] was perfected[^h8003].
###### 17
Then went[^h1980] Solomon[^h8010] to Eziongeber[^h6100], and to Eloth[^h359], at the sea[^h3220] side[^h8193] in the land[^h776] of Edom[^h123]. 
###### 18
And Huram[^h2361] sent[^h7971] him by the hands[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650] ships[^h591] [^h591], and servants[^h5650] that had knowledge[^h3045] of the sea[^h3220]; and they went[^h935] with the servants[^h5650] of Solomon[^h8010] to Ophir[^h211], and took[^h3947] thence four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], and brought[^h935] them to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].

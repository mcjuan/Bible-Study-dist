###### 1
And Solomon[^h8010] determined[^h559] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], and an house[^h1004] for his kingdom[^h4438].
###### 2
And Solomon[^h8010] told out[^h5608] threescore and ten[^h7657] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] to bear burdens[^h5449], and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] [^h376] to hew[^h2672] in the mountain[^h2022], and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] to oversee[^h5329] them.
###### 3
And Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971] to Huram[^h2361] the king[^h4428] of Tyre[^h6865], saying[^h559], As thou didst deal[^h6213] with David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and didst send[^h7971] him cedars[^h730] to build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004] to dwell[^h3427] therein, even so deal with me. 
###### 4
Behold, I build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] to the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], to dedicate[^h6942] it to him, and to burn[^h6999] before[^h6440] him sweet[^h5561] incense[^h7004], and for the continual[^h8548] shewbread[^h4635], and for the burnt offerings[^h5930] morning[^h1242] and evening[^h6153], on the sabbaths[^h7676], and on the new moons[^h2320], and on the solemn feasts[^h4150] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]. This is an ordinance for ever[^h5769] to Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 5
And the house[^h1004] which I build[^h1129] is great[^h1419]: for great[^h1419] is our God[^h430] above all gods[^h430].
###### 6
But who is able[^h6113] [^h3581] to build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004], seeing the heaven[^h8064] and heaven[^h8064] of heavens[^h8064] cannot contain[^h3557] him? who am I then, that I should build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004], save only[^h518] to burn sacrifice[^h6999] before[^h6440] him? 
###### 7
Send[^h7971] me now therefore a man[^h376] cunning[^h2450] to work[^h6213] in gold[^h2091], and in silver[^h3701], and in brass[^h5178], and in iron[^h1270], and in purple[^h710], and crimson[^h3758], and blue[^h8504], and that can skill[^h3045] to grave[^h6605] [^h6603] with the cunning men[^h2450] that are with me in Judah[^h3063] and in Jerusalem[^h3389], whom David[^h1732] my father[^h1] did provide[^h3559]. 
###### 8
Send[^h7971] me also cedar[^h730] trees[^h6086], fir trees[^h1265], and algum trees[^h418], out of Lebanon[^h3844]: for I know[^h3045] that thy servants[^h5650] can skill[^h3045] to cut[^h3772] timber[^h6086] in Lebanon[^h3844]; and, behold, my servants[^h5650] shall be with thy servants[^h5650], 
###### 9
Even to prepare[^h3559] me timber[^h6086] in abundance[^h7230]: for the house[^h1004] which I am about to build[^h1129] shall be wonderful[^h6381] great[^h1419]. 
###### 10
And, behold, I will give[^h5414] to thy servants[^h5650], the hewers[^h2404] that cut[^h3772] timber[^h6086], twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] measures[^h3734] of beaten[^h4347] wheat[^h2406], and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] measures[^h3734] of barley[^h8184], and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] baths[^h1324] of wine[^h3196], and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] baths[^h1324] of oil[^h8081].
###### 11
Then Huram[^h2361] the king[^h4428] of Tyre[^h6865] answered[^h559] in writing[^h3791], which he sent[^h7971] to Solomon[^h8010], Because the LORD[^h3068] hath loved[^h160] his people[^h5971], he hath made[^h5414] thee king[^h4428] over them.
###### 12
Huram[^h2361] said[^h559] moreover, Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], that made[^h6213] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776], who hath given[^h5414] to David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] a wise[^h2450] son[^h1121], endued[^h3045] with prudence[^h7922] and understanding[^h998], that might build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the LORD[^h3068], and an house[^h1004] for his kingdom[^h4438]. 
###### 13
And now I have sent[^h7971] a cunning[^h2450] man[^h376], endued[^h3045] with understanding[^h998], of Huram[^h2361] my father's[^h1],
###### 14
The son[^h1121] of a woman[^h802] of the daughters[^h1323] of Dan[^h1835], and his father[^h1] was a man[^h376] of Tyre[^h6876], skilful[^h3045] to work[^h6213] in gold[^h2091], and in silver[^h3701], in brass[^h5178], in iron[^h1270], in stone[^h68], and in timber[^h6086], in purple[^h713], in blue[^h8504], and in fine linen[^h948], and in crimson[^h3758]; also to grave[^h6605] any manner of graving[^h6603], and to find out[^h2803] every device[^h4284] which shall be put[^h5414] to him, with thy cunning men[^h2450], and with the cunning men[^h2450] of my lord[^h113] David[^h1732] thy father[^h1].
###### 15
Now therefore the wheat[^h2406], and the barley[^h8184], the oil[^h8081], and the wine[^h3196], which my lord[^h113] hath spoken[^h559] of, let him send[^h7971] unto his servants[^h5650]:
###### 16
And we will cut[^h3772] wood[^h6086] out of Lebanon[^h3844], as much as thou shalt need[^h6878]: and we will bring[^h935] it to thee in floats[^h7513] by sea[^h3220] to Joppa[^h3305]; and thou shalt carry it up[^h5927] to Jerusalem[^h3389].  
###### 17
And Solomon[^h8010] numbered[^h5608] all the strangers[^h582] [^h1616] that were in the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478], after[^h310] the numbering[^h5610] wherewith David[^h1732] his father[^h1] had numbered[^h5608] them; and they were found[^h4672] an hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] thousand[^h505] and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967]. 
###### 18
And he set[^h6213] threescore and ten[^h7657] thousand[^h505] of them to be bearers of burdens[^h5449], and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] to be hewers[^h2672] in the mountain[^h2022], and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] overseers[^h5329] to set[^h5647] the people[^h5971] a work[^h5647].

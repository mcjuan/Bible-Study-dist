###### 1
After[^h310] these things[^h1697], and the establishment[^h571] thereof, Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] came[^h935], and entered[^h935] into Judah[^h3063], and encamped[^h2583] against the fenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892], and thought[^h559] to win[^h1234] them for himself. 
###### 2
And when Hezekiah[^h3169] saw[^h7200] that Sennacherib[^h5576] was come[^h935], and that he was purposed[^h6440] to fight[^h4421] against Jerusalem[^h3389], 
###### 3
He took counsel[^h3289] with his princes[^h8269] and his mighty men[^h1368] to stop[^h5640] the waters[^h4325] of the fountains[^h5869] which were without[^h2351] the city[^h5892]: and they did help[^h5826] him.
###### 4
So there was gathered[^h6908] much[^h7227] people[^h5971] together[^h6908], who stopped[^h5640] all the fountains[^h4599], and the brook[^h5158] that ran[^h7857] through the midst[^h8432] of the land[^h776], saying[^h559], Why should the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] come[^h935], and find[^h4672] much[^h7227] water[^h4325]? 
###### 5
Also he strengthened[^h2388] himself, and built up[^h1129] all the wall[^h2346] that was broken[^h6555], and raised it up[^h5927] to the towers[^h4026], and another[^h312] wall[^h2346] without[^h2351], and repaired[^h2388] Millo[^h4407] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], and made[^h6213] darts[^h7973] and shields[^h4043] in abundance[^h7230]. 
###### 6
And he set[^h5414] captains[^h8269] of war[^h4421] over the people[^h5971], and gathered them together[^h6908] to him in the street[^h7339] of the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892], and spake[^h1696] comfortably[^h3824] to them, saying[^h559], 
###### 7
Be strong[^h2388] and courageous[^h553], be not afraid[^h3372] nor dismayed[^h2865] for[^h6440] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], nor for all the multitude[^h1995] that is with him: for there be more[^h7227] with us than with him:
###### 8
With him is an arm[^h2220] of flesh[^h1320]; but with us is the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] to help[^h5826] us, and to fight[^h3898] our battles[^h4421]. And the people[^h5971] rested[^h5564] themselves upon the words[^h1697] of Hezekiah[^h3169] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]. 
###### 9
After[^h310] this did Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] send[^h7971] his servants[^h5650] to Jerusalem[^h3389], (but he himself laid siege against Lachish[^h3923], and all his power[^h4475] with him,) unto Hezekiah[^h3169] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and unto all Judah[^h3063] that were at Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], 
###### 10
Thus saith[^h559] Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], Whereon do ye trust[^h982], that ye abide[^h3427] in the siege[^h4692] in Jerusalem[^h3389]? 
###### 11
Doth not Hezekiah[^h3169] persuade[^h5496] you to give[^h5414] over yourselves to die[^h4191] by famine[^h7458] and by thirst[^h6772], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] shall deliver[^h5337] us out of the hand[^h3709] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]?
###### 12
Hath not the same Hezekiah[^h3169] taken away[^h5493] his high places[^h1116] and his altars[^h4196], and commanded[^h559] Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], Ye shall worship[^h7812] before[^h6440] one[^h259] altar[^h4196], and burn incense[^h6999] upon it?
###### 13
Know[^h3045] ye not what I and my fathers[^h1] have done[^h6213] unto all the people[^h5971] of other lands[^h776]? were the gods[^h430] of the nations[^h1471] of those lands[^h776] any ways[^h3201] able[^h3201] to deliver[^h5337] their lands[^h776] out of mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 14
Who was there among all the gods[^h430] of those nations[^h1471] that my fathers[^h1] utterly destroyed[^h2763], that could[^h3201] deliver[^h5337] his people[^h5971] out of mine hand[^h3027], that your God[^h430] should be able[^h3201] to deliver[^h5337] you out of mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 15
Now therefore let not[^h3808] Hezekiah[^h2396] deceive[^h5377] you, nor persuade[^h5496] you on this manner, neither yet believe[^h539] him: for no god[^h433] of any nation[^h1471] or kingdom[^h4467] was able[^h3201] to deliver[^h5337] his people[^h5971] out of mine hand[^h3027], and out of the hand[^h3027] of my fathers[^h1]: how much less shall your God[^h430] deliver[^h5337] you out of mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 16
And his servants[^h5650] spake[^h1696] yet more against the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], and against his servant[^h5650] Hezekiah[^h3169].
###### 17
He wrote[^h3789] also letters[^h5612] to rail[^h2778] on the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], and to speak[^h559] against him, saying[^h559], As the gods[^h430] of the nations[^h1471] of other lands[^h776] have not delivered[^h5337] their people[^h5971] out of mine hand[^h3027], so shall not the God[^h430] of Hezekiah[^h3169] deliver[^h5337] his people[^h5971] out of mine hand[^h3027].
###### 18
Then they cried[^h7121] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963] in the Jews' speech[^h3066] unto the people[^h5971] of Jerusalem[^h3389] that were on the wall[^h2346], to affright[^h3372] them, and to trouble[^h926] them; that they might take[^h3920] the city[^h5892].
###### 19
And they spake[^h1696] against[^h5921] the God[^h430] of Jerusalem[^h3389], as against the gods[^h430] of the people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776], which were the work[^h4639] of the hands[^h3027] of man[^h120].
###### 20
And for this cause Hezekiah[^h3169] the king[^h4428], and the prophet[^h5030] Isaiah[^h3470] the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531], prayed[^h6419] and cried[^h2199] to heaven[^h8064].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] an angel[^h4397], which cut off[^h3582] all the mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], and the leaders[^h5057] and captains[^h8269] in the camp[^h4264] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]. So he returned[^h7725] with shame[^h1322] of face[^h6440] to his own land[^h776]. And when he was come[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of his god[^h430], they that came forth[^h3329] of his own bowels[^h4578] slew[^h5307] him there with the sword[^h2719]. 
###### 22
Thus the LORD[^h3068] saved[^h3467] Hezekiah[^h3169] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] from the hand[^h3027] of Sennacherib[^h5576] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and from the hand[^h3027] of all other, and guided[^h5095] them on every side[^h5439].
###### 23
And many[^h7227] brought[^h935] gifts[^h4503] unto the LORD[^h3068] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and presents[^h4030] to Hezekiah[^h3169] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]: so that he was magnified[^h5375] in the sight[^h5869] of all nations[^h1471] from thenceforth[^h310]. 
###### 24
In those days[^h3117] Hezekiah[^h3169] was sick[^h2470] to the death[^h4191], and prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and he spake[^h559] unto him, and he gave[^h5414] him a sign[^h4159]. 
###### 25
But Hezekiah[^h3169] rendered not again[^h7725] according to the benefit[^h1576] done unto him; for his heart[^h3820] was lifted up[^h1361]: therefore there was wrath[^h7110] upon him, and upon Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 26
Notwithstanding Hezekiah[^h3169] humbled[^h3665] himself for the pride[^h1363] of his heart[^h3820], both he and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], so that the wrath[^h7110] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h935] not upon them in the days[^h3117] of Hezekiah[^h3169]. 
###### 27
And Hezekiah[^h3169] had exceeding[^h3966] much[^h7235] riches[^h6239] and honour[^h3519]: and he made[^h6213] himself treasuries[^h214] for silver[^h3701], and for gold[^h2091], and for precious[^h3368] stones[^h68], and for spices[^h1314], and for shields[^h4043], and for all manner of pleasant[^h2532] jewels[^h3627]; 
###### 28
Storehouses[^h4543] also for the increase[^h8393] of corn[^h1715], and wine[^h8492], and oil[^h3323]; and stalls[^h723] for all manner of beasts[^h929], and cotes[^h220] for flocks[^h5739].
###### 29
Moreover he provided[^h6213] him cities[^h5892], and possessions[^h4735] of flocks[^h6629] and herds[^h1241] in abundance[^h7230]: for God[^h430] had given[^h5414] him substance[^h7399] very[^h3966] much[^h7227].
###### 30
This same Hezekiah[^h3169] also stopped[^h5640] the upper[^h5945] watercourse[^h4161] [^h4325] of Gihon[^h1521], and brought it straight[^h3474] down[^h4295] to the west side[^h4628] of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]. And Hezekiah[^h3169] prospered[^h6743] in all his works[^h4639].
###### 31
Howbeit[^h3651] in the business of the ambassadors[^h3887] of the princes[^h8269] of Babylon[^h894], who sent[^h7971] unto him to enquire[^h1875] of the wonder[^h4159] that was done in the land[^h776], God[^h430] left[^h5800] him, to try[^h5254] him, that he might know[^h3045] all that was in his heart[^h3824]. 
###### 32
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Hezekiah[^h3169], and his goodness[^h2617], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the vision[^h2377] of Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030], the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531], and in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 33
And Hezekiah[^h3169] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him in the chiefest[^h4608] of the sepulchres[^h6913] of the sons[^h1121] of David[^h1732]: and all Judah[^h3063] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] did him[^h6213] honour[^h3519] at his death[^h4194]. And Manasseh[^h4519] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

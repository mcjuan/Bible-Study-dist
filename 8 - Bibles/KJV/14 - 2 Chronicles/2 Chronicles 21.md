###### 1
Now Jehoshaphat[^h3092] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]. And Jehoram[^h3088] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 2
And he had brethren[^h251] the sons[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Azariah[^h5838], and Jehiel[^h3171], and Zechariah[^h2148], and Azariah[^h5838], and Michael[^h4317], and Shephatiah[^h8203]: all these were the sons[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
And their father[^h1] gave[^h5414] them great[^h7227] gifts[^h4979] of silver[^h3701], and of gold[^h2091], and of precious things[^h4030], with fenced[^h4694] cities[^h5892] in Judah[^h3063]: but the kingdom[^h4467] gave[^h5414] he to Jehoram[^h3088]; because he was the firstborn[^h1060].
###### 4
Now when Jehoram[^h3088] was risen up[^h6965] to the kingdom[^h4467] of his father[^h1], he strengthened[^h2388] himself, and slew[^h2026] all his brethren[^h251] with the sword[^h2719], and divers also of the princes[^h8269] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
Jehoram[^h3088] was thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 6
And he walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], like as did[^h6213] the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for he had the daughter[^h1323] of Ahab[^h256] to wife[^h802]: and he wrought[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
Howbeit the LORD[^h3068] would[^h14] not destroy[^h7843] the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], because of the covenant[^h1285] that he had made[^h3772] with David[^h1732], and as he promised[^h559] to give[^h5414] a light[^h5216] to him and to his sons[^h1121] for ever[^h3117]. 
###### 8
In his days[^h3117] the Edomites[^h123] revolted[^h6586] from under the dominion[^h3027] of Judah[^h3063], and made[^h4427] themselves a king[^h4428]. 
###### 9
Then Jehoram[^h3088] went forth[^h5674] with his princes[^h8269], and all his chariots[^h7393] with him: and he rose up[^h6965] by night[^h3915], and smote[^h5221] the Edomites[^h123] which compassed him in[^h5437], and the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393].
###### 10
So the Edomites[^h123] revolted[^h6586] from under the hand[^h3027] of Judah[^h3063] unto this day[^h3117]. The same time[^h6256] also did Libnah[^h3841] revolt[^h6586] from under his hand[^h3027]; because he had forsaken[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1].
###### 11
Moreover he made[^h6213] high places[^h1116] in the mountains[^h2022] of Judah[^h3063], and caused the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] to commit fornication[^h2181], and compelled[^h5080] Judah[^h3063] thereto.
###### 12
And there came[^h935] a writing[^h4385] to him from Elijah[^h452] the prophet[^h5030], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of David[^h1732] thy father[^h1], Because thou hast not walked[^h1980] in the ways[^h1870] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] thy father[^h1], nor in the ways[^h1870] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063],
###### 13
But hast walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and hast made Judah[^h3063] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] to go a whoring[^h2181], like to the whoredoms[^h2181] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256], and also hast slain[^h2026] thy brethren[^h251] of thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], which were better[^h2896] than thyself:
###### 14
Behold, with a great[^h1419] plague[^h4046] will the LORD[^h3068] smite[^h5062] thy people[^h5971], and thy children[^h1121], and thy wives[^h802], and all thy goods[^h7399]: 
###### 15
And thou shalt have great[^h7227] sickness[^h2483] by disease[^h4245] of thy bowels[^h4578], until thy bowels[^h4578] fall out[^h3318] by reason of the sickness[^h2483] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117].
###### 16
Moreover the LORD[^h3068] stirred up[^h5782] against Jehoram[^h3088] the spirit[^h7307] of the Philistines[^h6430], and of the Arabians[^h6163], that were near[^h5921] [^h3027] the Ethiopians[^h3569]:
###### 17
And they came up[^h5927] into Judah[^h3063], and brake[^h1234] into it, and carried away[^h7617] all the substance[^h7399] that was found[^h4672] in the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and his sons[^h1121] also, and his wives[^h802]; so that there was never a son[^h1121] left[^h7604] him, save Jehoahaz[^h3059], the youngest[^h6996] of his sons[^h1121].  
###### 18
And after[^h310] all this the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5062] him in his bowels[^h4578] with an incurable[^h369] [^h4832] disease[^h2483].
###### 19
And it came to pass, that in process of time[^h3117], after[^h3318] [^h6256] the end[^h7093] of two[^h8147] years[^h3117], his bowels[^h4578] fell out[^h3318] by reason[^h5973] of his sickness[^h2483]: so he died[^h4191] of sore[^h7451] diseases[^h8463]. And his people[^h5971] made[^h6213] no burning[^h8316] for him, like the burning[^h8316] of his fathers[^h1].
###### 20
Thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] years old[^h1121] was he when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] eight[^h8083] years[^h8141], and departed[^h3212] without being desired[^h2532]. Howbeit they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], but not in the sepulchres[^h6913] of the kings[^h4428].

###### 1
Manasseh[^h4519] was twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] fifty[^h2572] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]:
###### 2
But did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], like unto the abominations[^h8441] of the heathen[^h1471], whom the LORD[^h3068] had cast out[^h3423] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
For he built[^h1129] again[^h7725] the high places[^h1116] which Hezekiah[^h3169] his father[^h1] had broken down[^h5422], and he reared up[^h6965] altars[^h4196] for Baalim[^h1168], and made[^h6213] groves[^h842], and worshipped[^h7812] all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], and served[^h5647] them. 
###### 4
Also he built[^h1129] altars[^h4196] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], whereof the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h559], In Jerusalem[^h3389] shall my name[^h8034] be for ever[^h5769].
###### 5
And he built[^h1129] altars[^h4196] for all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064] in the two[^h8147] courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And he caused[^h5674] his children[^h1121] to pass through[^h5674] the fire[^h784] in the valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011]: also he observed times[^h6049], and used enchantments[^h5172], and used witchcraft[^h3784], and dealt[^h6213] with a familiar spirit[^h178], and with wizards[^h3049]: he wrought[^h6213] much[^h7235] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], to provoke him to anger[^h3707].
###### 7
And he set[^h7760] a carved image[^h6459], the idol[^h5566] which he had made[^h6213], in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], of which God[^h430] had said[^h559] to David[^h1732] and to Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], In this house[^h1004], and in Jerusalem[^h3389], which I have chosen[^h977] before all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], will I put[^h7760] my name[^h8034] for ever[^h5865]:
###### 8
Neither will I any more[^h3254] remove[^h5493] the foot[^h7272] of Israel[^h3478] from out[^h5921] of the land[^h127] which I have appointed[^h5975] for your fathers[^h1]; so that[^h518] they will take heed[^h8104] to do[^h6213] all that I have commanded[^h6680] them, according to the whole law[^h8451] and the statutes[^h2706] and the ordinances[^h4941] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 9
So Manasseh[^h4519] made[^h8582] Judah[^h3063] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] to err[^h8582], and to do[^h6213] worse[^h7451] than the heathen[^h1471], whom the LORD[^h3068] had destroyed[^h8045] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] to Manasseh[^h4519], and to his people[^h5971]: but they would not hearken[^h7181].
###### 11
Wherefore the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h935] upon them the captains of[^h8269] the host of[^h6635] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], which took[^h3920] Manasseh[^h4519] among the thorns[^h2336], and bound him[^h631] with fetters[^h5178], and carried[^h3212] him to Babylon[^h894].  
###### 12
And when he was in affliction[^h6887], he besought[^h2470] the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and humbled[^h3665] himself greatly[^h3966] before[^h6440] the God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1],
###### 13
And prayed[^h6419] unto him: and he was intreated[^h6279] of him, and heard[^h8085] his supplication[^h8467], and brought him again[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389] into his kingdom[^h4438]. Then Manasseh[^h4519] knew[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] he was God[^h430].
###### 14
Now after this[^h310] he built[^h1129] a wall[^h2346] without[^h2435] the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], on the west side[^h4628] of Gihon[^h1521], in the valley[^h5158], even to the entering in[^h935] at the fish[^h1709] gate[^h8179], and compassed[^h5437] about Ophel[^h6077], and raised it up[^h1361] a very great height[^h3966], and put[^h7760] captains[^h8269] of war[^h2428] in all the fenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063]. 
###### 15
And he took away[^h5493] the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430], and the idol[^h5566] out of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and all the altars[^h4196] that he had built[^h1129] in the mount[^h2022] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in Jerusalem[^h3389], and cast[^h7993] them out[^h2351] of the city[^h5892].
###### 16
And he repaired[^h1129] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], and sacrificed[^h2076] thereon peace[^h8002] offerings[^h2077] and thank offerings[^h8426], and commanded[^h559] Judah[^h3063] to serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 17
Nevertheless[^h61] the people[^h5971] did sacrifice[^h2076] still in the high places[^h1116], yet unto the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430] only.
###### 18
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Manasseh[^h4519], and his prayer[^h8605] unto his God[^h430], and the words[^h1697] of the seers[^h2374] that spake[^h1696] to him in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], behold, they are written in the book[^h1697] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 19
His prayer[^h8605] also, and how God was intreated[^h6279] of him, and all his sin[^h2403], and his trespass[^h4604], and the places[^h4725] wherein he built[^h1129] high places[^h1116], and set up[^h5975] groves[^h842] and graven images[^h6456], before[^h6440] he was humbled[^h3665]: behold, they are written[^h3789] among the sayings[^h1697] of the seers[^h2374] [^h2335]. 
###### 20
So Manasseh[^h4519] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him in his own house[^h1004]: and Amon[^h526] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 21
Amon[^h526] was two[^h8147] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] two[^h8147] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 22
But he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], as did[^h6213] Manasseh[^h4519] his father[^h1]: for Amon[^h526] sacrificed[^h2076] unto all the carved images[^h6456] which Manasseh[^h4519] his father[^h1] had made[^h6213], and served[^h5647] them;
###### 23
And humbled[^h3665] not himself before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], as Manasseh[^h4519] his father[^h1] had humbled[^h3665] himself; but Amon[^h526] trespassed[^h819] more and more[^h7235]. 
###### 24
And his servants[^h5650] conspired[^h7194] against him, and slew[^h4191] him in his own house[^h1004].
###### 25
But the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] slew[^h5221] all them that had conspired[^h7194] against king[^h4428] Amon[^h526]; and the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] made[^h4427] Josiah[^h2977] his son[^h1121] king[^h4427] in his stead.

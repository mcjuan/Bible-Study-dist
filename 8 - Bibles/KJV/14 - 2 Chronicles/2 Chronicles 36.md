###### 1
Then the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] took[^h3947] Jehoahaz[^h3059] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977], and made him king[^h4427] in his father's[^h1] stead in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
Jehoahaz[^h3099] was twenty[^h6242] and three[^h7969] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] three[^h7969] months[^h2320] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] put him down[^h5493] at Jerusalem[^h3389], and condemned[^h6064] the land[^h776] in an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701] and a talent[^h3603] of gold[^h2091]. 
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] made Eliakim[^h471] his brother[^h251] king[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], and turned[^h5437] his name[^h8034] to Jehoiakim[^h3079]. And Necho[^h5224] took[^h3947] Jehoahaz[^h3099] his brother[^h251], and carried[^h935] him to Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
Jehoiakim[^h3079] was twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] eleven[^h259] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: and he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430].
###### 6
Against him came up[^h5927] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and bound[^h631] him in fetters[^h5178], to carry[^h3212] him to Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 7
Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] also carried[^h935] of the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] to Babylon[^h894], and put[^h5414] them in his temple[^h1964] at Babylon[^h894].
###### 8
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoiakim[^h3079], and his abominations[^h8441] which he did[^h6213], and that which was found[^h4672] in him, behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063]: and Jehoiachin[^h3078] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead. 
###### 9
Jehoiachin[^h3078] was eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] three[^h7969] months[^h2320] and ten[^h6235] days[^h3117] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: and he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
And when the year[^h8141] was expired[^h8666], king[^h4428] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] sent[^h7971], and brought[^h935] him to Babylon[^h894], with the goodly[^h2532] vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and made Zedekiah[^h6667] his brother[^h251] king[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389].   
###### 11
Zedekiah[^h6667] was one[^h259] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] eleven[^h259] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 12
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and humbled[^h3665] not himself before[^h6440] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] speaking from the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And he also rebelled[^h4775] against king[^h4428] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019], who had made him swear[^h7650] by God[^h430]: but he stiffened[^h7185] his neck[^h6203], and hardened[^h553] his heart[^h3824] from turning[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
Moreover all the chief[^h8269] of the priests[^h3548], and the people[^h5971], transgressed[^h4603] very[^h4604] much[^h7235] after all the abominations[^h8441] of the heathen[^h1471]; and polluted[^h2930] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] which he had hallowed[^h6942] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1] sent[^h7971] to them by[^h3027] his messengers[^h4397], rising up betimes[^h7925], and sending[^h7971]; because he had compassion[^h2550] on his people[^h5971], and on his dwelling place[^h4583]:  
###### 16
But they mocked[^h3931] the messengers[^h4397] of God[^h430], and despised[^h959] his words[^h1697], and misused[^h8591] his prophets[^h5030], until the wrath[^h2534] of the LORD[^h3068] arose[^h5927] against his people[^h5971], till there was no remedy[^h4832]. 
###### 17
Therefore he brought[^h5927] upon them the king[^h4428] of the Chaldees[^h3778], who slew[^h2026] their young men[^h970] with the sword[^h2719] in the house[^h1004] of their sanctuary[^h4720], and had no compassion[^h2550] upon young man[^h970] or maiden[^h1330], old man[^h2205], or him that stooped for age[^h3486]: he gave[^h5414] them all into his hand[^h3027].
###### 18
And all the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], great[^h1419] and small[^h6996], and the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the treasures[^h214] of the king[^h4428], and of his princes[^h8269]; all these he brought[^h935] to Babylon[^h894].
###### 19
And they burnt[^h8313] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and brake down[^h5422] the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and burnt[^h8313] all the palaces[^h759] thereof with fire[^h784], and destroyed[^h7843] all the goodly[^h4261] vessels[^h3627] thereof.
###### 20
And them that had escaped[^h7611] from the sword[^h2719] carried he away[^h1540] to Babylon[^h894]; where they were servants[^h5650] to him and his sons[^h1121] until the reign[^h4427] of the kingdom[^h4438] of Persia[^h6539]: 
###### 21
To fulfil[^h4390] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] by the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414], until the land[^h776] had enjoyed[^h7521] her sabbaths[^h7676]: for as long as[^h3117] she lay desolate[^h8074] she kept sabbath[^h7673], to fulfil[^h4390] threescore and ten[^h7657] years[^h8141].
###### 22
Now in the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] spoken by the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414] might be accomplished[^h3615], the LORD[^h3068] stirred up[^h5782] the spirit[^h7307] of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], that he made a proclamation[^h5674] [^h6963] throughout all his kingdom[^h4438], and put it also in writing[^h4385], saying[^h559],
###### 23
Thus saith[^h559] Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], All the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776] hath the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064] given[^h5414] me; and he hath charged[^h6485] me to build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004] in Jerusalem[^h3389], which is in Judah[^h3063]. Who is there among you of all his people[^h5971]? The LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] be with him, and let him go up[^h5927].

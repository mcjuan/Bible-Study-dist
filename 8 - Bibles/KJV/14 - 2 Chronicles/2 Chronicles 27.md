###### 1
Jotham[^h3147] was twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Jerushah[^h3388], the daughter[^h1323] of Zadok[^h6659].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his father[^h1] Uzziah[^h5818] did[^h6213]: howbeit he entered[^h935] not into the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068]. And the people[^h5971] did yet corruptly[^h7843].
###### 3
He built[^h1129] the high[^h5945] gate[^h8179] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and on the wall[^h2346] of Ophel[^h6077] he built[^h1129] much[^h7230]. 
###### 4
Moreover he built[^h1129] cities[^h5892] in the mountains[^h2022] of Judah[^h3063], and in the forests[^h2793] he built[^h1129] castles[^h1003] and towers[^h4026].
###### 5
He fought[^h3898] also with the king[^h4428] of the Ammonites[^h5984], and prevailed[^h2388] against them. And the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] gave[^h5414] him the same year[^h8141] an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] measures[^h3734] of wheat[^h2406], and ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] of barley[^h8184]. So much did the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] pay[^h7725] unto[^h2063] him, both the second[^h8145] year[^h8141], and the third[^h7992]. 
###### 6
So Jotham[^h3147] became mighty[^h2388], because he prepared[^h3559] his ways[^h1870] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430]. 
###### 7
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jotham[^h3147], and all his wars[^h4421], and his ways[^h1870], lo, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063].
###### 8
He was five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and reigned[^h4427] sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 9
And Jotham[^h3147] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Ahaz[^h271] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

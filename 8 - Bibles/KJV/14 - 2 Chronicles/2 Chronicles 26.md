###### 1
Then all the people[^h5971] of Judah[^h3063] took[^h3947] Uzziah[^h5818], who was sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], and made him king[^h4427] in the room of his father[^h1] Amaziah[^h558]. 
###### 2
He built[^h1129] Eloth[^h359], and restored[^h7725] it to Judah[^h3063], after[^h310] that the king[^h4428] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1].
###### 3
Sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was Uzziah[^h5818] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] fifty[^h2572] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Jecoliah[^h3203] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 4
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that his father[^h1] Amaziah[^h558] did[^h6213].
###### 5
And he sought[^h1875] God[^h430] in the days[^h3117] of Zechariah[^h2148], who had understanding[^h995] in the visions[^h7200] of God[^h430]: and as long as[^h3117] he sought[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068], God[^h430] made him to prosper[^h6743]. 
###### 6
And he went forth[^h3318] and warred[^h3898] against the Philistines[^h6430], and brake down[^h6555] the wall[^h2346] of Gath[^h1661], and the wall[^h2346] of Jabneh[^h2996], and the wall[^h2346] of Ashdod[^h795], and built[^h1129] cities[^h5892] about Ashdod[^h795], and among the Philistines[^h6430]. 
###### 7
And God[^h430] helped[^h5826] him against the Philistines[^h6430], and against the Arabians[^h6163] that dwelt[^h3427] in Gurbaal[^h1485], and the Mehunims[^h4586].
###### 8
And the Ammonites[^h5984] gave[^h5414] gifts[^h4503] to Uzziah[^h5818]: and his name[^h8034] spread abroad[^h3212] even to the entering[^h935] in of Egypt[^h4714]; for he strengthened[^h2388] himself exceedingly[^h4605]. 
###### 9
Moreover Uzziah[^h5818] built[^h1129] towers[^h4026] in Jerusalem[^h3389] at the corner[^h6438] gate[^h8179], and at the valley[^h1516] gate[^h8179], and at the turning[^h4740] of the wall, and fortified[^h2388] them. 
###### 10
Also he built[^h1129] towers[^h4026] in the desert[^h4057], and digged[^h2672] many[^h7227] wells[^h953]: for he had much[^h7227] cattle[^h4735], both in the low country[^h8219], and in the plains[^h4334]: husbandmen[^h406] also, and vine dressers[^h3755] in the mountains[^h2022], and in Carmel[^h3760]: for he loved[^h157] husbandry[^h127].   
###### 11
Moreover Uzziah[^h5818] had an host[^h2428] of fighting[^h4421] men[^h6213], that went out[^h3318] to war[^h6635] by bands[^h1416], according to the number[^h4557] of their account[^h6486] by the hand[^h3027] of Jeiel[^h3273] the scribe[^h5608] and Maaseiah[^h4641] the ruler[^h7860], under the hand[^h3027] of Hananiah[^h2608], one of the king's[^h4428] captains[^h8269].
###### 12
The whole number[^h4557] of the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of the mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428] were two thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967].
###### 13
And under their hand[^h3027] was an army[^h2428] [^h6635], three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967], that made[^h6213] war[^h4421] with mighty[^h2428] power[^h3581], to help[^h5826] the king[^h4428] against the enemy[^h341]. 
###### 14
And Uzziah[^h5818] prepared[^h3559] for them throughout all the host[^h6635] shields[^h4043], and spears[^h7420], and helmets[^h3553], and habergeons[^h8302], and bows[^h7198], and slings[^h7050] to cast stones[^h68]. 
###### 15
And he made[^h6213] in Jerusalem[^h3389] engines[^h2810], invented[^h4284] by cunning men[^h2803], to be on the towers[^h4026] and upon the bulwarks[^h6438], to shoot[^h3384] arrows[^h2671] and great[^h1419] stones[^h68] withal. And his name[^h8034] spread[^h3318] far abroad[^h7350]; for he was marvellously[^h6381] helped[^h5826], till[^h3588] he was strong[^h2388]. 
###### 16
But when he was strong[^h2393], his heart[^h3820] was lifted up[^h1361] to his destruction[^h7843]: for he transgressed[^h4603] against the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and went[^h935] into the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068] to burn incense[^h6999] upon the altar[^h4196] of incense[^h7004].
###### 17
And Azariah[^h5838] the priest[^h3548] went in[^h935] after[^h310] him, and with him fourscore[^h8084] priests[^h3548] of the LORD[^h3068], that were valiant[^h2428] men[^h1121]:
###### 18
And they withstood[^h5975] Uzziah[^h5818] the king[^h4428], and said[^h559] unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah[^h5818], to burn incense[^h6999] unto the LORD[^h3068], but to the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], that are consecrated[^h6942] to burn incense[^h6999]: go out[^h3318] of the sanctuary[^h4720]; for thou hast trespassed[^h4603]; neither shall it be for thine honour[^h3519] from the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430].
###### 19
Then Uzziah[^h5818] was wroth[^h2196], and had a censer[^h4730] in his hand[^h3027] to burn incense[^h6999]: and while he was wroth[^h2196] with the priests[^h3548], the leprosy[^h6883] even rose up[^h2224] in his forehead[^h4696] before[^h6440] the priests[^h3548] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], from beside the incense[^h7004] altar[^h4196].
###### 20
And Azariah[^h5838] the chief[^h7218] priest[^h3548], and all the priests[^h3548], looked[^h6437] upon him, and, behold, he was leprous[^h6879] in his forehead[^h4696], and they thrust him out[^h926] from thence; yea, himself hasted[^h1765] also to go out[^h3318], because the LORD[^h3068] had smitten[^h5060] him.
###### 21
And Uzziah[^h5818] the king[^h4428] was a leper[^h6879] unto the day[^h3117] of his death[^h4194], and dwelt in[^h3427] a several[^h2669] [^h2669] house[^h1004], being a leper[^h6879]; for he was cut off[^h1504] from the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and Jotham[^h3147] his son[^h1121] was over the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], judging[^h8199] the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776]. 
###### 22
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Uzziah[^h5818], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], did Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030], the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531], write[^h3789].
###### 23
So Uzziah[^h5818] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him with his fathers[^h1] in the field[^h7704] of the burial[^h6900] which belonged to the kings[^h4428]; for they said[^h559], He is a leper[^h6879]: and Jotham[^h3147] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

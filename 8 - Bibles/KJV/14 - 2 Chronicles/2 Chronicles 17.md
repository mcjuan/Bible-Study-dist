###### 1
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead, and strengthened[^h2388] himself against Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And he placed[^h5414] forces[^h2428] in all the fenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and set[^h5414] garrisons[^h5333] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], and in the cities[^h5892] of Ephraim[^h669], which Asa[^h609] his father[^h1] had taken[^h3920].
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] was with Jehoshaphat[^h3092], because he walked[^h1980] in the first[^h7223] ways[^h1870] of his father[^h1] David[^h1732], and sought[^h1875] not unto Baalim[^h1168]; 
###### 4
But sought[^h1875] to the LORD God[^h430] of his father[^h1], and walked[^h1980] in his commandments[^h4687], and not after the doings[^h4639] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] stablished[^h3559] the kingdom[^h4467] in his hand[^h3027]; and all Judah[^h3063] brought[^h5414] to Jehoshaphat[^h3092] presents[^h4503]; and he had riches[^h6239] and honour[^h3519] in abundance[^h7230]. 
###### 6
And his heart[^h3820] was lifted up[^h1361] in the ways[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068]: moreover he took away[^h5493] the high places[^h1116] and groves[^h842] out of Judah[^h3063]. 
###### 7
Also in the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427] he sent[^h7971] to his princes[^h8269], even to Benhail[^h1134], and to Obadiah[^h5662], and to Zechariah[^h2148], and to Nethaneel[^h5417], and to Michaiah[^h4322], to teach[^h3925] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 8
And with them he sent Levites[^h3881], even Shemaiah[^h8098], and Nethaniah[^h5418], and Zebadiah[^h2069], and Asahel[^h6214], and Shemiramoth[^h8070], and Jehonathan[^h3083], and Adonijah[^h138], and Tobijah[^h2900], and Tobadonijah[^h2899], Levites[^h3881]; and with them Elishama[^h476] and Jehoram[^h3088], priests[^h3548].
###### 9
And they taught[^h3925] in Judah[^h3063], and had the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] with them, and went about[^h5437] throughout all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and taught[^h3925] the people[^h5971].
###### 10
And the fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068] fell upon all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the lands[^h776] that were round about[^h5439] Judah[^h3063], so that they made no war[^h3898] against Jehoshaphat[^h3092]. 
###### 11
Also some of the Philistines[^h6430] brought[^h935] Jehoshaphat[^h3092] presents[^h4503], and tribute[^h4853] silver[^h3701]; and the Arabians[^h6163] brought[^h935] him flocks[^h6629], seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] rams[^h352], and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] he goats[^h8495].
###### 12
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] waxed[^h1980] great[^h1432] exceedingly[^h4605]; and he built[^h1129] in Judah[^h3063] castles[^h1003], and cities[^h5892] of store[^h4543]. 
###### 13
And he had much[^h7227] business[^h4399] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063]: and the men[^h582] of war[^h4421], mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], were in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 14
And these are the numbers[^h6486] of them according to the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1]: Of Judah[^h3063], the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505]; Adnah[^h5734] the chief[^h8269], and with him mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505].
###### 15
And next[^h3027] to him was Jehohanan[^h3076] the captain[^h8269], and with him two hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505]. 
###### 16
And next[^h3027] him was Amasiah[^h6007] the son[^h1121] of Zichri[^h2147], who willingly offered[^h5068] himself unto the LORD[^h3068]; and with him two hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428].
###### 17
And of Benjamin[^h1144]; Eliada[^h450] a mighty man[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], and with him armed men[^h5401] with bow[^h7198] and shield[^h4043] two hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505].
###### 18
And next[^h3027] him was Jehozabad[^h3075], and with him an hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] ready prepared[^h2502] for the war[^h6635].
###### 19
These waited[^h8334] on the king[^h4428], beside those whom the king[^h4428] put[^h5414] in the fenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892] throughout all Judah[^h3063].

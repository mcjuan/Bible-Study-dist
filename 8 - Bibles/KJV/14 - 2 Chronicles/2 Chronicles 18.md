###### 1
Now Jehoshaphat[^h3092] had riches[^h6239] and honour[^h3519] in abundance[^h7230], and joined affinity[^h2859] with Ahab[^h256].
###### 2
And after[^h7093] certain years[^h8141] he went down[^h3381] to Ahab[^h256] to Samaria[^h8111]. And Ahab[^h256] killed[^h2076] sheep[^h6629] and oxen[^h1241] for him in abundance[^h7230], and for the people[^h5971] that he had with him, and persuaded[^h5496] him to go up[^h5927] with him to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]. 
###### 3
And Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], Wilt thou go[^h3212] with me to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]? And he answered[^h559] him, I am as thou art, and my people[^h5971] as thy people[^h5971]; and we will be with thee in the war[^h4421].
###### 4
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Enquire[^h1875], I pray thee, at the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] to day[^h3117].
###### 5
Therefore the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] gathered together[^h6908] of prophets[^h5030] four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376], and said[^h559] unto them, Shall we go[^h3212] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568] to battle[^h4421], or shall I forbear[^h2308]? And they said[^h559], Go up[^h5927]; for God[^h430] will deliver[^h5414] it into the king's[^h4428] hand[^h3027].
###### 6
But Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], Is there not here a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068] besides, that we might enquire[^h1875] of him? 
###### 7
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], There is yet one[^h259] man[^h376], by whom we may enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068]: but I hate[^h8130] him; for he never prophesied[^h5012] good[^h2896] unto me, but always[^h3117] evil[^h7451]: the same is Micaiah[^h4321] the son[^h1121] of Imla[^h3229]. And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], Let not the king[^h4428] say[^h559] so.
###### 8
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] called[^h7121] for one[^h259] of his officers[^h5631], and said[^h559], Fetch quickly[^h4116] Micaiah[^h4319] the son[^h1121] of Imla[^h3229].  
###### 9
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] sat[^h3427] either[^h376] of them on his throne[^h3678], clothed[^h3847] in their robes[^h899], and they sat[^h3427] in a void place[^h1637] at the entering in[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of Samaria[^h8111]; and all the prophets[^h5030] prophesied[^h5012] before[^h6440] them. 
###### 10
And Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Chenaanah[^h3668] had made[^h6213] him horns[^h7161] of iron[^h1270], and said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], With these thou shalt push[^h5055] Syria[^h758] until they be consumed[^h3615]. 
###### 11
And all the prophets[^h5030] prophesied[^h5012] so, saying[^h559], Go up[^h5927] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568], and prosper[^h6743]: for the LORD[^h3068] shall deliver[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428].
###### 12
And the messenger[^h4397] that went[^h1980] to call[^h7121] Micaiah[^h4321] spake[^h1696] to him, saying[^h559], Behold, the words[^h1697] of the prophets[^h5030] declare good[^h2896] to the king[^h4428] with one[^h259] assent[^h6310]; let thy word[^h1697] therefore, I pray thee, be like one[^h259] of theirs, and speak[^h1696] thou good[^h2896]. 
###### 13
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], even what my God[^h430] saith[^h559], that will I speak[^h1696].
###### 14
And when he was come[^h935] to the king[^h4428], the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Micaiah[^h4318], shall we go[^h3212] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568] to battle[^h4421], or shall I forbear[^h2308]? And he said[^h559], Go ye up[^h5927], and prosper[^h6743], and they shall be delivered[^h5414] into your hand[^h3027].
###### 15
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to him, How many times[^h6471] shall I adjure[^h7650] thee that thou say[^h1696] nothing but the truth[^h571] to me in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 16
Then he said[^h559], I did see[^h7200] all Israel[^h3478] scattered[^h6327] upon the mountains[^h2022], as sheep[^h6629] that have no shepherd[^h7462]: and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], These have no master[^h113]; let them return[^h7725] therefore every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004] in peace[^h7965].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] to Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Did I not tell[^h559] thee that he would not prophesy[^h5012] good[^h2896] unto me, but evil[^h7451]? 
###### 18
Again he said[^h559], Therefore hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]; I saw[^h7200] the LORD[^h3068] sitting[^h3427] upon his throne[^h3678], and all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064] standing[^h5975] on his right hand[^h3225] and on his left[^h8040].
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Who shall entice[^h6601] Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that he may go up[^h5927] and fall[^h5307] at Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]? And one spake[^h559] saying[^h559] after this manner[^h3602], and another saying[^h559] after that manner[^h3602].
###### 20
Then there came out[^h3318] a spirit[^h7307], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], I will entice[^h6601] him. And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Wherewith?
###### 21
And he said[^h559], I will go out[^h3318], and be a lying[^h8267] spirit[^h7307] in the mouth[^h6310] of all his prophets[^h5030]. And the LORD said[^h559], Thou shalt entice[^h6601] him, and thou shalt also prevail[^h3201]: go out[^h3318], and do[^h6213] even so.
###### 22
Now therefore, behold, the LORD[^h3068] hath put[^h5414] a lying[^h8267] spirit[^h7307] in the mouth[^h6310] of these thy prophets[^h5030], and the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] evil[^h7451] against thee.
###### 23
Then Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Chenaanah[^h3668] came near[^h5066], and smote[^h5221] Micaiah[^h4321] upon the cheek[^h3895], and said[^h559], Which[^h335] way[^h1870] went[^h5674] the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] from me to speak[^h1696] unto thee?
###### 24
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], Behold, thou shalt see[^h7200] on that day[^h3117] when thou shalt go[^h935] into an inner[^h2315] chamber[^h2315] to hide[^h2244] thyself. 
###### 25
Then the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Take[^h3947] ye Micaiah[^h4321], and carry him back[^h7725] to Amon[^h526] the governor[^h8269] of the city[^h5892], and to Joash[^h3101] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121];
###### 26
And say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Put[^h7760] this fellow in the prison[^h1004] [^h3608], and feed[^h398] him with bread[^h3899] of affliction[^h3906] and with water[^h4325] of affliction[^h3906], until I return[^h7725] in peace[^h7965].
###### 27
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], If thou certainly[^h7725] return[^h7725] in peace[^h7965], then hath not the LORD[^h3068] spoken[^h1696] by me. And he said[^h559], Hearken[^h8085], all ye people[^h5971].
###### 28
So the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went up[^h5927] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568].
###### 29
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], I will disguise[^h2664] myself, and will go[^h935] to the battle[^h4421]; but put[^h3847] thou on thy robes[^h899]. So the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] disguised[^h2664] himself; and they went[^h935] to the battle[^h4421].
###### 30
Now the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] had commanded[^h6680] the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393] that were with him, saying[^h559], Fight[^h3898] ye not with small[^h6996] or great[^h1419], save only with the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 31
And it came to pass, when the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393] saw[^h7200] Jehoshaphat[^h3092], that they said[^h559], It is the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]. Therefore they compassed about[^h5437] him to fight[^h3898]: but Jehoshaphat[^h3092] cried out[^h2199], and the LORD[^h3068] helped[^h5826] him; and God[^h430] moved[^h5496] them to depart from him.
###### 32
For it came to pass, that, when the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393] perceived[^h7200] that it was not the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], they turned back again[^h7725] from pursuing[^h310] him. 
###### 33
And a certain man drew[^h4900] a bow[^h7198] at a venture[^h8537], and smote[^h5221] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] between the joints[^h1694] of the harness[^h8302]: therefore he said[^h559] to his chariot[^h7395] man[^h376], Turn[^h2015] thine hand[^h3027], that thou mayest carry me out[^h3318] of the host[^h4264]; for I am wounded[^h2470].   
###### 34
And the battle[^h4421] increased[^h5927] that day[^h3117]: howbeit the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] stayed himself up[^h5975] in his chariot[^h4818] against[^h5227] the Syrians[^h758] until the even[^h6153]: and about the time[^h6256] of the sun[^h8121] going down[^h935] he died[^h4191].

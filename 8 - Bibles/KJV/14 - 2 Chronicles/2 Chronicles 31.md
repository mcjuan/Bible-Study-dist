###### 1
Now when all this was finished[^h3615], all Israel[^h3478] that were present[^h4672] went out[^h3318] to the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and brake[^h7665] the images[^h4676] in pieces[^h7665], and cut down[^h1438] the groves[^h842], and threw down[^h5422] the high places[^h1116] and the altars[^h4196] out of all Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], in Ephraim[^h669] also and Manasseh[^h4519], until they had utterly destroyed[^h3615] them all. Then all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] returned[^h7725], every man[^h376] to his possession[^h272], into their own cities[^h5892].   
###### 2
And Hezekiah[^h3169] appointed[^h5975] the courses[^h4256] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] after their courses[^h4256], every man[^h376] according[^h6310] to his service[^h5656], the priests[^h3548] and Levites[^h3881] for burnt offerings[^h5930] and for peace offerings[^h8002], to minister[^h8334], and to give thanks[^h3034], and to praise[^h1984] in the gates[^h8179] of the tents[^h4264] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
He appointed also the king's[^h4428] portion[^h4521] of his substance[^h7399] for the burnt offerings[^h5930], to wit, for the morning[^h1242] and evening[^h6153] burnt offerings[^h5930], and the burnt offerings[^h5930] for the sabbaths[^h7676], and for the new moons[^h2320], and for the set feasts[^h4150], as it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
Moreover he commanded[^h559] the people[^h5971] that dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] to give[^h5414] the portion[^h4521] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], that they might be encouraged[^h2388] in the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
And as soon as the commandment[^h1697] came abroad[^h6555], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] brought[^h935] in abundance[^h7235] the firstfruits[^h7225] of corn[^h1715], wine[^h8492], and oil[^h3323], and honey[^h1706], and of all the increase[^h8393] of the field[^h7704]; and the tithe[^h4643] of all things brought[^h935] they in abundantly[^h7230].  
###### 6
And concerning the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063], that dwelt[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], they also brought in[^h935] the tithe[^h4643] of oxen[^h1241] and sheep[^h6629], and the tithe[^h4643] of holy things[^h6944] which were consecrated[^h6942] unto the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], and laid[^h5414] them by heaps[^h6194] [^h6194]. 
###### 7
In the third[^h7992] month[^h2320] they began[^h2490] to lay the foundation[^h3245] of the heaps[^h6194], and finished[^h3615] them in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320].
###### 8
And when Hezekiah[^h3169] and the princes[^h8269] came[^h935] and saw[^h7200] the heaps[^h6194], they blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], and his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478].
###### 9
Then Hezekiah[^h3169] questioned[^h1875] with the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] concerning the heaps[^h6194].
###### 10
And Azariah[^h5838] the chief[^h7218] priest[^h3548] of the house[^h1004] of Zadok[^h6659] answered[^h559] him, and said[^h559], Since the people began[^h2490] to bring[^h935] the offerings[^h8641] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], we have had enough[^h7646] to eat[^h398], and have left[^h3498] plenty[^h7230]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] his people[^h5971]; and that which is left[^h3498] is this great store[^h1995].
###### 11
Then Hezekiah[^h3169] commanded[^h559] to prepare[^h3559] chambers[^h3957] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; and they prepared[^h3559] them, 
###### 12
And brought in[^h935] the offerings[^h8641] and the tithes[^h4643] and the dedicated[^h6944] things faithfully[^h530]: over which Cononiah[^h3562] the Levite[^h3881] was ruler[^h5057], and Shimei[^h8096] his brother[^h251] was the next[^h4932].
###### 13
And Jehiel[^h3171], and Azaziah[^h5812], and Nahath[^h5184], and Asahel[^h6214], and Jerimoth[^h3406], and Jozabad[^h3107], and Eliel[^h447], and Ismachiah[^h3253], and Mahath[^h4287], and Benaiah[^h1141], were overseers[^h6496] under the hand[^h3027] of Cononiah[^h3562] and Shimei[^h8096] his brother[^h251], at the commandment[^h4662] of Hezekiah[^h3169] the king[^h4428], and Azariah[^h5838] the ruler[^h5057] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]. 
###### 14
And Kore[^h6981] the son[^h1121] of Imnah[^h3232] the Levite[^h3881], the porter[^h7778] toward the east[^h4217], was over the freewill offerings[^h5071] of God[^h430], to distribute[^h5414] the oblations[^h8641] of the LORD[^h3068], and the most[^h6944] holy things[^h6944].
###### 15
And next him were Eden[^h5731], and Miniamin[^h4509], and Jeshua[^h3442], and Shemaiah[^h8098], Amariah[^h568], and Shecaniah[^h7935], in the cities[^h5892] of the priests[^h3548], in their set office[^h530], to give[^h5414] to their brethren[^h251] by[^h3027] courses[^h4256], as well to the great[^h1419] as to the small[^h6996]:  
###### 16
Beside their genealogy[^h3187] of males[^h2145], from three[^h7969] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and upward[^h4605], even unto every one that entereth[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], his daily[^h3117] [^h3117] portion[^h1697] for their service[^h5656] in their charges[^h4931] according to their courses[^h4256];
###### 17
Both to the genealogy[^h3187] of the priests[^h3548] by the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1], and the Levites[^h3881] from twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and upward[^h4605], in their charges[^h4931] by their courses[^h4256];
###### 18
And to the genealogy[^h3187] of all their little ones[^h2945], their wives[^h802], and their sons[^h1121], and their daughters[^h1323], through all the congregation[^h6951]: for in their set office[^h530] they sanctified[^h6942] themselves in holiness[^h6944]: 
###### 19
Also of the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] the priests[^h3548], which were in the fields[^h7704] of the suburbs[^h4054] of their cities[^h5892], in every several city[^h5892], the men[^h582] that were expressed[^h5344] by name[^h8034], to give[^h5414] portions[^h4490] to all the males[^h2145] among the priests[^h3548], and to all that were reckoned by genealogies[^h3187] among the Levites[^h3881].
###### 20
And thus did[^h6213] Hezekiah[^h3169] throughout all Judah[^h3063], and wrought[^h6213] that which was good[^h2896] and right[^h3477] and truth[^h571] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430].
###### 21
And in every work[^h4639] that he began[^h2490] in the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and in the law[^h8451], and in the commandments[^h4687], to seek[^h1875] his God[^h430], he did[^h6213] it with all his heart[^h3824], and prospered[^h6743].

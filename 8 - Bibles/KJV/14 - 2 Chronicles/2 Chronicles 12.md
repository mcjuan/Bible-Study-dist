###### 1
And it came to pass, when Rehoboam[^h7346] had established[^h3559] the kingdom[^h4438], and had strengthened[^h2393] himself, he forsook[^h5800] the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068], and all Israel[^h3478] with him.
###### 2
And it came to pass, that in the fifth[^h2549] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] Shishak[^h7895] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] came up[^h5927] against Jerusalem[^h3389], because they had transgressed[^h4603] against the LORD[^h3068],
###### 3
With twelve hundred[^h3967] [^h505] chariots[^h7393], and threescore[^h8346] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571]: and the people[^h5971] were without number[^h4557] that came[^h935] with him out of Egypt[^h4714]; the Lubims[^h3864], the Sukkiims[^h5525], and the Ethiopians[^h3569].
###### 4
And he took[^h3920] the fenced[^h4694] cities[^h5892] which pertained to Judah[^h3063], and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 5
Then came[^h935] Shemaiah[^h8098] the prophet[^h5030] to Rehoboam[^h7346], and to the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063], that were gathered together[^h622] to Jerusalem[^h3389] because[^h6440] of Shishak[^h7895], and said[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Ye have forsaken[^h5800] me, and therefore have I also[^h637] left[^h5800] you in the hand[^h3027] of Shishak[^h7895].
###### 6
Whereupon the princes[^h8269] of Israel[^h3478] and the king[^h4428] humbled[^h3665] themselves; and they said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] is righteous[^h6662].
###### 7
And when the LORD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] that they humbled[^h3665] themselves, the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Shemaiah[^h8098], saying[^h559], They have humbled[^h3665] themselves; therefore I will not destroy[^h7843] them, but I will grant[^h5414] them some[^h4592] deliverance[^h6413]; and my wrath[^h2534] shall not be poured out[^h5413] upon Jerusalem[^h3389] by the hand[^h3027] of Shishak[^h7895]. 
###### 8
Nevertheless they shall be his servants[^h5650]; that they may know[^h3045] my service[^h5656], and the service[^h5656] of the kingdoms[^h4467] of the countries[^h776].
###### 9
So Shishak[^h7895] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] came up[^h5927] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and took away[^h3947] the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]; he took[^h3947] all: he carried away[^h3947] also the shields[^h4043] of gold[^h2091] which Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213].
###### 10
Instead of which king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] made[^h6213] shields[^h4043] of brass[^h5178], and committed[^h6485] them to the hands[^h3027] of the chief[^h8269] of the guard[^h7323], that kept[^h8104] the entrance[^h6607] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004].
###### 11
And when[^h1767] the king[^h4428] entered[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], the guard[^h7323] came[^h935] and fetched[^h5375] them, and brought them again[^h7725] into the guard[^h7323] chamber[^h8372].
###### 12
And when he humbled[^h3665] himself, the wrath[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] turned[^h7725] from him, that he would not destroy[^h7843] him altogether[^h3617]: and also in Judah[^h3063] things[^h1697] went well[^h2896]. 
###### 13
So king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] strengthened[^h2388] himself in Jerusalem[^h3389], and reigned[^h4427]: for Rehoboam[^h7346] was one[^h259] and forty[^h705] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] seventeen[^h7651] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389], the city[^h5892] which the LORD[^h3068] had chosen[^h977] out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], to put[^h7760] his name[^h8034] there. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Naamah[^h5279] an Ammonitess[^h5985].
###### 14
And he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451], because he prepared[^h3559] not his heart[^h3820] to seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 15
Now the acts[^h1697] of Rehoboam[^h7346], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h1697] of Shemaiah[^h8098] the prophet[^h5030], and of Iddo[^h5714] the seer[^h2374] concerning genealogies[^h3187]? And there were wars[^h4421] between Rehoboam[^h7346] and Jeroboam[^h3379] continually[^h3117]. 
###### 16
And Rehoboam[^h7346] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Abijah[^h29] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

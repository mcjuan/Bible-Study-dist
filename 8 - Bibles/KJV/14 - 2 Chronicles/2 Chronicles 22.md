###### 1
And the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] made[^h4427] Ahaziah[^h274] his youngest[^h6996] son[^h1121] king[^h4427] in his stead: for the band of men[^h1416] that came[^h935] with the Arabians[^h6163] to the camp[^h4264] had slain[^h2026] all the eldest[^h7223]. So Ahaziah[^h274] the son[^h1121] of Jehoram[^h3088] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] reigned[^h4427].
###### 2
Forty[^h705] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was Ahaziah[^h274] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] one[^h259] year[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Athaliah[^h6271] the daughter[^h1323] of Omri[^h6018].
###### 3
He also walked[^h1980] in the ways[^h1870] of the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for his mother[^h517] was his counsellor[^h3289] to do wickedly[^h7561].
###### 4
Wherefore he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] like the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]: for they were his counsellors[^h3289] after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of his father[^h1] to his destruction[^h4889].
###### 5
He walked[^h1980] also after their counsel[^h6098], and went[^h3212] with Jehoram[^h3088] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] to war[^h4421] against Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] at Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]: and the Syrians[^h7421] smote[^h5221] Joram[^h3141].
###### 6
And he returned[^h7725] to be healed[^h7495] in Jezreel[^h3157] because of the wounds[^h4347] which were given[^h5221] him at Ramah[^h7414], when he fought[^h3898] with Hazael[^h2371] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758]. And Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Jehoram[^h3088] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went down[^h3381] to see[^h7200] Jehoram[^h3088] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] at Jezreel[^h3157], because he was sick[^h2470].  
###### 7
And the destruction[^h8395] of Ahaziah[^h274] was of God[^h430] by coming[^h935] to Joram[^h3141]: for when he was come[^h935], he went out[^h3318] with Jehoram[^h3088] against Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Nimshi[^h5250], whom the LORD[^h3068] had anointed[^h4886] to cut off[^h3772] the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256]. 
###### 8
And it came to pass, that, when Jehu[^h3058] was executing judgment[^h8199] upon the house[^h1004] of Ahab[^h256], and found[^h4672] the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063], and the sons[^h1121] of the brethren[^h251] of Ahaziah[^h274], that ministered[^h8334] to Ahaziah[^h274], he slew[^h2026] them.
###### 9
And he sought[^h1245] Ahaziah[^h274]: and they caught[^h3920] him, (for he was hid[^h2244] in Samaria[^h8111],) and brought[^h935] him to Jehu[^h3058]: and when they had slain[^h4191] him, they buried[^h6912] him: Because, said[^h559] they, he is the son[^h1121] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092], who sought[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] with all his heart[^h3824]. So the house[^h1004] of Ahaziah[^h274] had no power[^h3581] to keep[^h6113] still the kingdom[^h4467].
###### 10
But when Athaliah[^h6271] the mother[^h517] of Ahaziah[^h274] saw[^h7200] that her son[^h1121] was dead[^h4191], she arose[^h6965] and destroyed[^h1696] all the seed[^h2233] royal[^h4467] of the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 11
But Jehoshabeath[^h3090], the daughter[^h1323] of the king[^h4428], took[^h3947] Joash[^h3101] the son[^h1121] of Ahaziah[^h274], and stole[^h1589] him from among[^h8432] the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] that were slain[^h4191], and put[^h5414] him and his nurse[^h3243] in a bedchamber[^h2315] [^h4296]. So Jehoshabeath[^h3090], the daughter[^h1323] of king[^h4428] Jehoram[^h3088], the wife[^h802] of Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548], (for she was the sister[^h269] of Ahaziah[^h274],) hid[^h5641] him from[^h6440] Athaliah[^h6271], so that she slew[^h4191] him not.
###### 12
And he was with them hid[^h2244] in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] six[^h8337] years[^h8141]: and Athaliah[^h6271] reigned[^h4427] over the land[^h776].

###### 1
Ahaz[^h271] was twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: but he did[^h6213] not that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], like David[^h1732] his father[^h1]:
###### 2
For he walked in[^h3212] the ways[^h1870] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and made[^h6213] also molten images[^h4541] for Baalim[^h1168].
###### 3
Moreover he burnt incense[^h6999] in the valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], and burnt[^h1197] his children[^h1121] in the fire[^h784], after the abominations[^h8441] of the heathen[^h1471] whom the LORD[^h3068] had cast out[^h3423] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 4
He sacrificed[^h2076] also and burnt incense[^h6999] in the high places[^h1116], and on the hills[^h1389], and under every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086].
###### 5
Wherefore the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] him into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758]; and they smote[^h5221] him, and carried away[^h7617] a great multitude[^h1419] of them captives[^h7633], and brought[^h935] them to Damascus[^h1834]. And he was also delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], who smote[^h5221] him with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]. 
###### 6
For Pekah[^h6492] the son[^h1121] of Remaliah[^h7425] slew[^h2026] in Judah[^h3063] an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] in one[^h259] day[^h3117], which were all valiant[^h2428] men[^h1121]; because they had forsaken[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 7
And Zichri[^h2147], a mighty man[^h1368] of Ephraim[^h669], slew[^h2026] Maaseiah[^h4641] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121], and Azrikam[^h5840] the governor[^h5057] of the house[^h1004], and Elkanah[^h511] that was next[^h4932] to the king[^h4428]. 
###### 8
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] carried away captive[^h7617] of their brethren[^h251] two hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505], women[^h802], sons[^h1121], and daughters[^h1323], and took also away[^h962] much[^h7227] spoil[^h7998] from them, and brought[^h935] the spoil[^h7998] to Samaria[^h8111].
###### 9
But a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068] was there, whose name[^h8034] was Oded[^h5752]: and he went out[^h3318] before[^h6440] the host[^h6635] that came[^h935] to Samaria[^h8111], and said[^h559] unto them, Behold, because the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1] was wroth[^h2534] with Judah[^h3063], he hath delivered[^h5414] them into your hand[^h3027], and ye have slain[^h2026] them in a rage[^h2197] that reacheth up[^h5060] unto heaven[^h8064].
###### 10
And now ye purpose[^h559] to keep under[^h3533] the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] for bondmen[^h5650] and bondwomen[^h8198] unto you: but are there not with you, even[^h7535] with you, sins[^h819] against the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]?
###### 11
Now hear[^h8085] me therefore, and deliver[^h7725] the captives[^h7633] again, which ye have taken captive[^h7617] of your brethren[^h251]: for the fierce[^h2740] wrath[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] is upon you.
###### 12
Then certain[^h582] of the heads[^h7218] of the children[^h1121] of Ephraim[^h669], Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Johanan[^h3076], Berechiah[^h1296] the son[^h1121] of Meshillemoth[^h4919], and Jehizkiah[^h3169] the son[^h1121] of Shallum[^h7967], and Amasa[^h6021] the son[^h1121] of Hadlai[^h2311], stood up[^h6965] against them that came[^h935] from the war[^h6635],
###### 13
And said[^h559] unto them, Ye shall not bring in[^h935] the captives[^h7633] hither: for whereas we have offended[^h819] against the LORD[^h3068] already, ye intend[^h559] to add[^h3254] more to our sins[^h2403] and to our trespass[^h819]: for our trespass[^h819] is great[^h7227], and there is fierce[^h2740] wrath[^h639] against Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
So the armed men[^h2502] left[^h5800] the captives[^h7633] and the spoil[^h961] before[^h6440] the princes[^h8269] and all the congregation[^h6951].
###### 15
And the men[^h582] which were expressed[^h5344] by name[^h8034] rose up[^h6965], and took[^h2388] the captives[^h7633], and with the spoil[^h7998] clothed[^h3847] all that were naked[^h4636] among them, and arrayed[^h3847] them, and shod[^h5274] them, and gave them to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8248], and anointed[^h5480] them, and carried[^h5095] all the feeble[^h3782] of them upon asses[^h2543], and brought[^h935] them to Jericho[^h3405], the city[^h5892] of palm trees[^h8558] [^h5899], to[^h681] their brethren[^h251]: then they returned[^h7725] to Samaria[^h8111].
###### 16
At that time[^h6256] did king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] send[^h7971] unto the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] to help[^h5826] him.
###### 17
For again the Edomites[^h130] had come[^h935] and smitten[^h5221] Judah[^h3063], and carried away[^h7617] captives[^h7628]. 
###### 18
The Philistines[^h6430] also had invaded[^h6584] the cities[^h5892] of the low country[^h8219], and of the south[^h5045] of Judah[^h3063], and had taken[^h3920] Bethshemesh[^h1053], and Ajalon[^h357], and Gederoth[^h1450], and Shocho[^h7755] with the villages[^h1323] thereof, and Timnah[^h8553] with the villages[^h1323] thereof, Gimzo[^h1579] also and the villages[^h1323] thereof: and they dwelt[^h3427] there.
###### 19
For the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h3665] Judah[^h3063] low[^h3665] because of Ahaz[^h271] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]; for he made[^h6544] Judah[^h3063] naked[^h6544], and transgressed[^h4603] sore[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
And Tilgathpilneser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] came[^h935] unto him, and distressed[^h6696] him, but strengthened[^h2388] him not.
###### 21
For Ahaz[^h271] took away a portion[^h2505] out of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and out of the house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428], and of the princes[^h8269], and gave[^h5414] it unto the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]: but he helped[^h5833] him not.
###### 22
And in the time[^h6256] of his distress[^h6887] did he trespass[^h4603] yet more[^h3254] against the LORD[^h3068]: this is that king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271].
###### 23
For he sacrificed[^h2076] unto the gods[^h430] of Damascus[^h1834], which smote[^h5221] him: and he said[^h559], Because the gods[^h430] of the kings[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] help[^h5826] them, therefore will I sacrifice[^h2076] to them, that they may help[^h5826] me. But they were the ruin[^h3782] of him, and of all Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 24
And Ahaz[^h271] gathered together[^h622] the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and cut in pieces[^h7112] the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and shut up[^h5462] the doors[^h1817] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and he made[^h6213] him altars[^h4196] in every corner[^h6438] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 25
And in every several city[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] he made[^h6213] high places[^h1116] to burn incense[^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], and provoked to anger[^h3707] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1]. 
###### 26
Now the rest[^h3499] of his acts[^h1697] and of all his ways[^h1870], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and Israel[^h3478].
###### 27
And Ahaz[^h271] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892], even in Jerusalem[^h3389]: but they brought[^h935] him not into the sepulchres[^h6913] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]: and Hezekiah[^h3169] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

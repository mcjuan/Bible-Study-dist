###### 1
And when Rehoboam[^h7346] was come[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], he gathered[^h6950] of the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144] an hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men, which were warriors[^h6213] [^h4421], to fight[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478], that he might bring[^h7725] the kingdom[^h4467] again[^h7725] to Rehoboam[^h7346].
###### 2
But the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Shemaiah[^h8098] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], saying[^h559],
###### 3
Speak[^h559] unto Rehoboam[^h7346] the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010], king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and to all Israel[^h3478] in Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Ye shall not go up[^h5927], nor fight[^h3898] against your brethren[^h251]: return[^h7725] every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004]: for this thing[^h1697] is done[^h1961] of me. And they obeyed[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and returned[^h7725] from going[^h3212] against Jeroboam[^h3379].
###### 5
And Rehoboam[^h7346] dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and built[^h1129] cities[^h5892] for defence[^h4692] in Judah[^h3063].
###### 6
He built[^h1129] even Bethlehem[^h1035], and Etam[^h5862], and Tekoa[^h8620],
###### 7
And Bethzur[^h1049], and Shoco[^h7755], and Adullam[^h5725],
###### 8
And Gath[^h1661], and Mareshah[^h4762], and Ziph[^h2128],
###### 9
And Adoraim[^h115], and Lachish[^h3923], and Azekah[^h5825],
###### 10
And Zorah[^h6881], and Aijalon[^h357], and Hebron[^h2275], which are in Judah[^h3063] and in Benjamin[^h1144] fenced[^h4694] cities[^h5892].
###### 11
And he fortified[^h2388] the strong holds[^h4694], and put[^h5414] captains[^h5057] in them, and store[^h214] of victual[^h3978], and of oil[^h8081] and wine[^h3196].
###### 12
And in every several city[^h5892] he put shields[^h6793] and spears[^h7420], and made them exceeding[^h7235] [^h3966] strong[^h2388], having Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144] on his side.
###### 13
And the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] that were in all Israel[^h3478] resorted[^h3320] to him out of all their coasts[^h1366]. 
###### 14
For the Levites[^h3881] left[^h5800] their suburbs[^h4054] and their possession[^h272], and came[^h3212] to Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389]: for Jeroboam[^h3379] and his sons[^h1121] had cast them off[^h2186] from executing the priest's office[^h3547] unto the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 15
And he ordained[^h5975] him priests[^h3548] for the high places[^h1116], and for the devils[^h8163], and for the calves[^h5695] which he had made[^h6213].
###### 16
And after[^h310] them out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] such as set[^h5414] their hearts[^h3824] to seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], to sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1].
###### 17
So they strengthened[^h2388] the kingdom[^h4438] of Judah[^h3063], and made Rehoboam[^h7346] the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010] strong[^h553], three[^h7969] years[^h8141]: for three[^h7969] years[^h8141] they walked[^h1980] in the way[^h1870] of David[^h1732] and Solomon[^h8010].
###### 18
And Rehoboam[^h7346] took[^h3947] him Mahalath[^h4258] the daughter[^h1323] [^h1121] of Jerimoth[^h3406] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] to wife[^h802], and Abihail[^h32] the daughter[^h1323] of Eliab[^h446] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448];
###### 19
Which bare[^h3205] him children[^h1121]; Jeush[^h3266], and Shamariah[^h8114], and Zaham[^h2093].
###### 20
And after[^h310] her he took[^h3947] Maachah[^h4601] the daughter[^h1323] of Absalom[^h53]; which bare[^h3205] him Abijah[^h29], and Attai[^h6262], and Ziza[^h2124], and Shelomith[^h8019].
###### 21
And Rehoboam[^h7346] loved[^h157] Maachah[^h4601] the daughter[^h1323] of Absalom[^h53] above all his wives[^h802] and his concubines[^h6370]: (for he took[^h5375] eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] wives[^h802], and threescore[^h8346] concubines[^h6370]; and begat[^h3205] twenty[^h6242] and eight[^h8083] sons[^h1121], and threescore[^h8346] daughters[^h1323].)
###### 22
And Rehoboam[^h7346] made[^h5975] Abijah[^h29] the son[^h1121] of Maachah[^h4601] the chief[^h7218], to be ruler[^h5057] among his brethren[^h251]: for he thought to make him king[^h4427].
###### 23
And he dealt wisely[^h995], and dispersed[^h6555] of all his children[^h1121] throughout all the countries[^h776] of Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], unto every fenced[^h4694] city[^h5892]: and he gave[^h5414] them victual[^h4202] in abundance[^h7230]. And he desired[^h7592] many[^h1995] wives[^h802].

###### 1
Now in the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Jeroboam[^h3379] began Abijah[^h29] to reign[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063].
###### 2
He reigned[^h4427] three[^h7969] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Michaiah[^h4322] the daughter[^h1323] of Uriel[^h222] of Gibeah[^h1390]. And there was war[^h4421] between Abijah[^h29] and Jeroboam[^h3379].
###### 3
And Abijah[^h29] set[^h631] the battle[^h4421] in array[^h631] with an army[^h2428] of valiant men[^h1368] of war[^h4421], even four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376]: Jeroboam[^h3379] also set the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] against him with eight[^h8083] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376], being mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428]. 
###### 4
And Abijah[^h29] stood up[^h6965] upon mount[^h2022] Zemaraim[^h6787], which is in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] me, thou Jeroboam[^h3379], and all Israel[^h3478];
###### 5
Ought ye not to know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] gave[^h5414] the kingdom[^h4467] over Israel[^h3478] to David[^h1732] for ever[^h5769], even to him and to his sons[^h1121] by a covenant[^h1285] of salt[^h4417]?
###### 6
Yet Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], the servant[^h5650] of Solomon[^h8010] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732], is risen up[^h6965], and hath rebelled[^h4775] against his lord[^h113].
###### 7
And there are gathered[^h6908] unto him vain[^h7386] men[^h582], the children[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], and have strengthened[^h553] themselves against Rehoboam[^h7346] the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010], when Rehoboam[^h7346] was young[^h5288] and tenderhearted[^h7390] [^h3824], and could not withstand[^h2388] them[^h6440].
###### 8
And now ye think[^h559] to withstand[^h2388] the kingdom[^h6440] [^h4467] of the LORD[^h3068] in the hand[^h3027] of the sons[^h1121] of David[^h1732]; and ye be a great[^h7227] multitude[^h1995], and there are with you golden[^h2091] calves[^h5695], which Jeroboam[^h3379] made[^h6213] you for gods[^h430].
###### 9
Have ye not cast out[^h5080] the priests[^h3548] of the LORD[^h3068], the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], and the Levites[^h3881], and have made[^h6213] you priests[^h3548] after the manner of the nations[^h5971] of other lands[^h776]? so that whosoever cometh[^h935] to consecrate[^h4390] [^h3027] himself with a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] and seven[^h7651] rams[^h352], the same may be a priest[^h3548] of them that are no[^h3808] gods[^h430]. 
###### 10
But as for us, the LORD[^h3068] is our God[^h430], and we have not forsaken[^h5800] him; and the priests[^h3548], which minister[^h8334] unto the LORD[^h3068], are the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], and the Levites[^h3881] wait upon their business[^h4399]:
###### 11
And they burn[^h6999] unto the LORD[^h3068] every morning[^h1242] and every evening[^h6153] burnt sacrifices[^h5930] and sweet[^h5561] incense[^h7004]: the shewbread[^h3899] [^h4635] also set they in order upon the pure[^h2889] table[^h7979]; and the candlestick[^h4501] of gold[^h2091] with the lamps[^h5216] thereof, to burn[^h1197] every evening[^h6153]: for we keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]; but ye have forsaken[^h5800] him.
###### 12
And, behold, God[^h430] himself is with us for our captain[^h7218], and his priests[^h3548] with sounding[^h8643] trumpets[^h2689] to cry alarm[^h7321] against you. O children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], fight[^h3898] ye not against the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1]; for ye shall not prosper[^h6743].
###### 13
But Jeroboam[^h3379] caused an ambushment[^h3993] to come[^h935] about[^h5437] behind[^h310] them: so they were before[^h6440] Judah[^h3063], and the ambushment[^h3993] was behind[^h310] them.
###### 14
And when Judah[^h3063] looked back[^h6437], behold, the battle[^h4421] was before[^h6440] and behind[^h268]: and they cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068], and the priests[^h3548] sounded[^h2690] [^h2690] with the trumpets[^h2689].
###### 15
Then the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] gave a shout[^h7321]: and as the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] shouted[^h7321], it came to pass, that God[^h430] smote[^h5062] Jeroboam[^h3379] and all Israel[^h3478] before[^h6440] Abijah[^h29] and Judah[^h3063].
###### 16
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] Judah[^h3063]: and God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] them into their hand[^h3027].
###### 17
And Abijah[^h29] and his people[^h5971] slew[^h5221] them with a great[^h7227] slaughter[^h4347]: so there fell down[^h5307] slain[^h2491] of Israel[^h3478] five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376].
###### 18
Thus the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were brought[^h3665] under at that time[^h6256], and the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] prevailed[^h553], because they relied[^h8172] upon the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1].
###### 19
And Abijah[^h29] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Jeroboam[^h3379], and took[^h3920] cities[^h5892] from him, Bethel[^h1008] with the towns[^h1323] thereof, and Jeshanah[^h3466] with the towns[^h1323] thereof, and Ephrain[^h6085] with the towns[^h1323] thereof.
###### 20
Neither did Jeroboam[^h3379] recover[^h6113] strength[^h3581] again in the days[^h3117] of Abijah[^h29]: and the LORD[^h3068] struck[^h5062] him, and he died[^h4191].
###### 21
But Abijah[^h29] waxed mighty[^h2388], and married[^h5375] fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] wives[^h802], and begat[^h3205] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], and sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] daughters[^h1323].
###### 22
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Abijah[^h29], and his ways[^h1870], and his sayings[^h1697], are written[^h3789] in the story[^h4097] of the prophet[^h5030] Iddo[^h5714].

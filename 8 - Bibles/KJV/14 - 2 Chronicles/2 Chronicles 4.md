Moreover he made[^h6213] an altar[^h4196] of brass[^h5178], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] the length[^h753] thereof, and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] the breadth[^h7341] thereof, and ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520] the height[^h6967] thereof.

###### 6
He made[^h6213] also ten[^h6235] lavers[^h3595], and put[^h5414] five[^h2568] on the right hand[^h3225], and five[^h2568] on the left[^h8040], to wash[^h7364] in them: such things as they offered[^h4639] for the burnt offering[^h5930] they washed[^h1740] in them; but the sea[^h3220] was for the priests[^h3548] to wash in[^h7364].

###### 10
And he set[^h5414] the sea[^h3220] on the right[^h3233] side[^h3802] of the east end[^h6924], over against[^h4136] the south[^h5045].
###### 11
And Huram[^h2361] made[^h6213] the pots[^h5518], and the shovels[^h3257], and the basons[^h4219]. And Huram[^h2361] [^h2438] finished[^h3615] [^h6213] the work[^h4399] that he was to make[^h6213] for king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] for the house[^h1004] of God[^h430];

###### 13
And four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] pomegranates[^h7416] on the two[^h8147] wreaths[^h7639]; two[^h8147] rows[^h2905] of pomegranates[^h7416] on each[^h259] wreath[^h7639], to cover[^h3680] the two[^h8147] pommels[^h1543] of the chapiters[^h3805] which were upon[^h6440] the pillars[^h5982]. 
###### 14

###### 15
One[^h259] sea[^h3220], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] oxen[^h1241] under it.
###### 16
The pots[^h5518] also, and the shovels[^h3257], and the fleshhooks[^h4207], and all their instruments[^h3627], did Huram[^h2361] his father[^h1] make[^h6213] to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] of bright[^h4838] brass[^h5178].

###### 18
Thus Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] all these vessels[^h3627] in great[^h3966] abundance[^h7230]: for the weight[^h4948] of the brass[^h5178] could not be found out[^h2713].
###### 19
And Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] all the vessels[^h3627] that were for the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], the golden[^h2091] altar[^h4196] also, and the tables[^h7979] whereon the shewbread[^h3899] [^h6440] was set;

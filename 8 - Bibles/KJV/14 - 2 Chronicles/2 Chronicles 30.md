###### 1
And Hezekiah[^h3169] sent[^h7971] to all Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063], and wrote[^h3789] letters[^h107] also to Ephraim[^h669] and Manasseh[^h4519], that they should come[^h935] to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] at Jerusalem[^h3389], to keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
For the king[^h4428] had taken counsel[^h3289], and his princes[^h8269], and all the congregation[^h6951] in Jerusalem[^h3389], to keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] in the second[^h8145] month[^h2320].
###### 3
For they could[^h3201] not keep[^h6213] it at that time[^h6256], because the priests[^h3548] had not sanctified[^h6942] themselves sufficiently[^h4078] [^h1767], neither had the people[^h5971] gathered themselves together[^h622] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 4
And the thing[^h1697] pleased[^h3474] [^h5869] the king[^h4428] and all the congregation[^h6951]. 
###### 5
So they established[^h5975] a decree[^h1697] to make proclamation[^h5674] [^h6963] throughout all Israel[^h3478], from Beersheba[^h884] even to Dan[^h1835], that they should come[^h935] to keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] at Jerusalem[^h3389]: for they had not done[^h6213] it of a long[^h7230] time in such sort as it was written[^h3789].
###### 6
So the posts[^h7323] went[^h3212] with the letters[^h107] from[^h3027] the king[^h4428] and his princes[^h8269] throughout all Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063], and according to the commandment[^h4687] of the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Ye children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], turn again[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Israel[^h3478], and he will return[^h7725] to the remnant[^h7604] of you, that are escaped[^h6413] out of the hand[^h3709] of the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]. 
###### 7
And be not ye like your fathers[^h1], and like your brethren[^h251], which trespassed[^h4603] against the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], who therefore gave them up[^h5414] to desolation[^h8047], as ye see[^h7200].
###### 8
Now be ye not stiffnecked[^h7185] [^h6203], as your fathers[^h1] were, but yield[^h5414] yourselves[^h3027] unto the LORD[^h3068], and enter[^h935] into his sanctuary[^h4720], which he hath sanctified[^h6942] for ever[^h5769]: and serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], that the fierceness[^h2740] of his wrath[^h639] may turn away[^h7725] from you.  
###### 9
For if ye turn again[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068], your brethren[^h251] and your children[^h1121] shall find compassion[^h7356] before[^h6440] them that lead them captive[^h7617], so that they shall come again[^h7725] into this land[^h776]: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] is gracious[^h2587] and merciful[^h7349], and will not turn away[^h5493] his face[^h6440] from you, if ye return[^h7725] unto him.
###### 10
So the posts[^h7323] passed[^h5674] from city[^h5892] to city[^h5892] through the country[^h776] of Ephraim[^h669] and Manasseh[^h4519] even unto Zebulun[^h2074]: but they laughed them to scorn[^h7832], and mocked[^h3932] them.
###### 11
Nevertheless divers[^h582] of Asher[^h836] and Manasseh[^h4519] and of Zebulun[^h2074] humbled[^h3665] themselves, and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 12
Also in Judah[^h3063] the hand[^h3027] of God[^h430] was to give[^h5414] them one[^h259] heart[^h3820] to do[^h6213] the commandment[^h4687] of the king[^h4428] and of the princes[^h8269], by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And there assembled[^h622] at Jerusalem[^h3389] much[^h7227] people[^h5971] to keep[^h6213] the feast[^h2282] of unleavened bread[^h4682] in the second[^h8145] month[^h2320], a very[^h3966] great[^h7230] congregation[^h6951].
###### 14
And they arose[^h6965] and took away[^h5493] the altars[^h4196] that were in Jerusalem[^h3389], and all the altars for incense[^h6999] took they away[^h5493], and cast[^h7993] them into the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939].
###### 15
Then they killed[^h7819] the passover[^h6453] on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day of the second[^h8145] month[^h2320]: and the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] were ashamed[^h3637], and sanctified[^h6942] themselves, and brought in[^h935] the burnt offerings[^h5930] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And they stood[^h5975] in their place[^h5977] after their manner[^h4941], according to the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872] the man[^h376] of God[^h430]: the priests[^h3548] sprinkled[^h2236] the blood[^h1818], which they received of the hand[^h3027] of the Levites[^h3881]. 
###### 17
For there were many[^h7227] in the congregation[^h6951] that were not sanctified[^h6942]: therefore the Levites[^h3881] had the charge of the killing[^h7821] of the passovers[^h6453] for every one that was not clean[^h2889], to sanctify[^h6942] them unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
For a multitude[^h4768] of the people[^h5971], even many[^h7227] of Ephraim[^h669], and Manasseh[^h4519], Issachar[^h3485], and Zebulun[^h2074], had not[^h3808] cleansed[^h2891] themselves, yet did they eat[^h398] the passover[^h6453] otherwise than it was written[^h3789]. But Hezekiah[^h3169] prayed[^h6419] for them, saying[^h559], The good[^h2896] LORD[^h3068] pardon[^h3722] every one
###### 19
That prepareth[^h3559] his heart[^h3824] to seek[^h1875] God[^h430], the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1], though he be not cleansed according to the purification[^h2893] of the sanctuary[^h6944].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] to Hezekiah[^h3169], and healed[^h7495] the people[^h5971].
###### 21
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] that were present[^h4672] at Jerusalem[^h3389] kept[^h6213] the feast[^h2282] of unleavened bread[^h4682] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] with great[^h1419] gladness[^h8057]: and the Levites[^h3881] and the priests[^h3548] praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117], singing with loud[^h5797] instruments[^h3627] unto the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 22
And Hezekiah[^h3169] spake[^h1696] comfortably[^h3820] unto all the Levites[^h3881] that taught[^h7919] the good[^h2896] knowledge[^h7922] of the LORD[^h3068]: and they did eat[^h398] throughout the feast[^h4150] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], offering[^h2076] peace[^h8002] offerings[^h2077], and making confession[^h3034] to the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 23
And the whole assembly[^h6951] took counsel[^h3289] to keep[^h6213] other[^h312] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]: and they kept[^h6213] other seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] with gladness[^h8057].
###### 24
For Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] did give[^h7311] to the congregation[^h6951] a thousand[^h505] bullocks[^h6499] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629]; and the princes[^h8269] gave[^h7311] to the congregation[^h6951] a thousand[^h505] bullocks[^h6499] and ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629]: and a great number[^h7230] of priests[^h3548] sanctified[^h6942] themselves.  
###### 25
And all the congregation[^h6951] of Judah[^h3063], with the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and all the congregation[^h6951] that came out[^h935] of Israel[^h3478], and the strangers[^h1616] that came out[^h935] of the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478], and that dwelt[^h3427] in Judah[^h3063], rejoiced[^h8055].
###### 26
So there was great[^h1419] joy[^h8057] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: for since the time[^h3117] of Solomon[^h8010] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] there was not the like in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 27
Then the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881] arose[^h6965] and blessed[^h1288] the people[^h5971]: and their voice[^h6963] was heard[^h8085], and their prayer[^h8605] came[^h935] up to his holy[^h6944] dwelling place[^h4583], even unto heaven[^h8064].

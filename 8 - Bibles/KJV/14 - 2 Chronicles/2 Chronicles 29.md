###### 1
Hezekiah[^h3169] began to reign[^h4427] when he was five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], and he reigned[^h4427] nine[^h8672] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Abijah[^h29], the daughter[^h1323] of Zechariah[^h2148].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that David[^h1732] his father[^h1] had done[^h6213].
###### 3
He in the first[^h7223] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], in the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], opened[^h6605] the doors[^h1817] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and repaired[^h2388] them.
###### 4
And he brought in[^h935] the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and gathered them together[^h622] into the east[^h4217] street[^h7339],
###### 5
And said[^h559] unto them, Hear[^h8085] me, ye Levites[^h3881], sanctify[^h6942] now yourselves, and sanctify[^h6942] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1], and carry forth[^h3318] the filthiness[^h5079] out of the holy[^h6944] place.
###### 6
For our fathers[^h1] have trespassed[^h4603], and done[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], and have forsaken[^h5800] him, and have turned away[^h5437] their faces[^h6440] from the habitation[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068], and turned[^h5414] their backs[^h6203]. 
###### 7
Also they have shut up[^h5462] the doors[^h1817] of the porch[^h197], and put out[^h3518] the lamps[^h5216], and have not burned[^h6999] incense[^h7004] nor offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] in the holy[^h6944] place unto the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
Wherefore the wrath[^h7110] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], and he hath delivered[^h5414] them to trouble[^h2189] [^h2113], to astonishment[^h8047], and to hissing[^h8322], as ye see[^h7200] with your eyes[^h5869]. 
###### 9
For, lo, our fathers[^h1] have fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], and our sons[^h1121] and our daughters[^h1323] and our wives[^h802] are in captivity[^h7628] for this.
###### 10
Now it is in mine heart[^h3824] to make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], that his fierce[^h2740] wrath[^h639] may turn away[^h7725] from us.
###### 11
My sons[^h1121], be not now negligent[^h7952]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath chosen[^h977] you to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] him, to serve[^h8334] him, and that ye should minister[^h8334] unto him, and burn incense[^h6999].  
###### 12
Then the Levites[^h3881] arose[^h6965], Mahath[^h4287] the son[^h1121] of Amasai[^h6022], and Joel[^h3100] the son[^h1121] of Azariah[^h5838], of the sons[^h1121] of the Kohathites[^h6956]: and of the sons[^h1121] of Merari[^h4847], Kish[^h7027] the son[^h1121] of Abdi[^h5660], and Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Jehalelel[^h3094]: and of the Gershonites[^h1649]; Joah[^h3098] the son[^h1121] of Zimmah[^h2155], and Eden[^h5731] the son[^h1121] of Joah[^h3098]:
###### 13
And of the sons[^h1121] of Elizaphan[^h469]; Shimri[^h8113], and Jeiel[^h3273]: and of the sons[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623]; Zechariah[^h2148], and Mattaniah[^h4983]:
###### 14
And of the sons[^h1121] of Heman[^h1968]; Jehiel[^h3171], and Shimei[^h8096]: and of the sons[^h1121] of Jeduthun[^h3038]; Shemaiah[^h8098], and Uzziel[^h5816].
###### 15
And they gathered[^h622] their brethren[^h251], and sanctified[^h6942] themselves, and came[^h935], according to the commandment[^h4687] of the king[^h4428], by the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], to cleanse[^h2891] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 16
And the priests[^h3548] went[^h935] into the inner part[^h6441] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], to cleanse[^h2891] it, and brought out[^h3318] all the uncleanness[^h2932] that they found[^h4672] in the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068] into the court[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And the Levites[^h3881] took[^h6901] it, to carry it out[^h3318] abroad[^h2351] into the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939].
###### 17
Now they began[^h2490] on the first[^h259] day of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] to sanctify[^h6942], and on the eighth[^h8083] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] came[^h935] they to the porch[^h197] of the LORD[^h3068]: so they sanctified[^h6942] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] in eight[^h8083] days[^h3117]; and in the sixteenth[^h8337] [^h6240] day of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] they made an end[^h3615].
###### 18
Then they went[^h935] in[^h6441] to Hezekiah[^h2396] the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], We have cleansed[^h2891] all the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the altar[^h4196] of burnt offering[^h5930], with all the vessels[^h3627] thereof, and the shewbread[^h4635] table[^h7979], with all the vessels[^h3627] thereof.
###### 19
Moreover all the vessels[^h3627], which king[^h4428] Ahaz[^h271] in his reign[^h4438] did cast away[^h2186] in his transgression[^h4604], have we prepared[^h3559] and sanctified[^h6942], and, behold, they are before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
Then Hezekiah[^h3169] the king[^h4428] rose early[^h7925], and gathered[^h622] the rulers[^h8269] of the city[^h5892], and went up[^h5927] to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
And they brought[^h935] seven[^h7651] bullocks[^h6499], and seven[^h7651] rams[^h352], and seven[^h7651] lambs[^h3532], and seven[^h7651] he[^h6842] goats[^h5795], for a sin offering[^h2403] for the kingdom[^h4467], and for the sanctuary[^h4720], and for Judah[^h3063]. And he commanded[^h559] the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] to offer[^h5927] them on the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
So they killed[^h7819] the bullocks[^h1241], and the priests[^h3548] received[^h6901] the blood[^h1818], and sprinkled[^h2236] it on the altar[^h4196]: likewise, when they had killed[^h7819] the rams[^h352], they sprinkled[^h2236] the blood[^h1818] upon the altar[^h4196]: they killed[^h7819] also the lambs[^h3532], and they sprinkled[^h2236] the blood[^h1818] upon the altar[^h4196].
###### 23
And they brought forth[^h5066] the he goats[^h8163] for the sin offering[^h2403] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] and the congregation[^h6951]; and they laid[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon them: 
###### 24
And the priests[^h3548] killed[^h7819] them, and they made reconciliation[^h2398] with their blood[^h1818] upon the altar[^h4196], to make an atonement[^h3722] for all Israel[^h3478]: for the king[^h4428] commanded[^h559] that the burnt offering[^h5930] and the sin offering[^h2403] should be made for all Israel[^h3478].
###### 25
And he set[^h5975] the Levites[^h3881] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] with cymbals[^h4700], with psalteries[^h5035], and with harps[^h3658], according to the commandment[^h4687] of David[^h1732], and of Gad[^h1410] the king's[^h4428] seer[^h2374], and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030]: for so was the commandment[^h4687] of[^h3027] the LORD[^h3068] by[^h3027] his prophets[^h5030].  
###### 26
And the Levites[^h3881] stood[^h5975] with the instruments[^h3627] of David[^h1732], and the priests[^h3548] with the trumpets[^h2689].
###### 27
And Hezekiah[^h2396] commanded[^h559] to offer[^h5927] the burnt offering[^h5930] upon the altar[^h4196]. And when[^h6256] the burnt offering[^h5930] began[^h2490], the song[^h7892] of the LORD[^h3068] began[^h2490] also with the trumpets[^h2689], and with the instruments[^h3627] ordained by[^h3027] David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].  
###### 28
And all the congregation[^h6951] worshipped[^h7812], and the singers[^h7892] sang[^h7891], and the trumpeters[^h2689] sounded[^h2690] [^h2690]: and all this continued until the burnt offering[^h5930] was finished[^h3615]. 
###### 29
And when they had made an end[^h3615] of offering[^h5927], the king[^h4428] and all that were present[^h4672] with him bowed[^h3766] themselves, and worshipped[^h7812]. 
###### 30
Moreover Hezekiah[^h3169] the king[^h4428] and the princes[^h8269] commanded[^h559] the Levites[^h3881] to sing praise[^h1984] unto the LORD[^h3068] with the words[^h1697] of David[^h1732], and of Asaph[^h623] the seer[^h2374]. And they sang praises[^h1984] with gladness[^h8057], and they bowed their heads[^h6915] and worshipped[^h7812].
###### 31
Then Hezekiah[^h3169] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Now ye have consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] yourselves unto the LORD[^h3068], come near[^h5066] and bring[^h935] sacrifices[^h2077] and thank offerings[^h8426] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And the congregation[^h6951] brought in[^h935] sacrifices[^h2077] and thank offerings[^h8426]; and as many as were of a free[^h5081] heart[^h3820] burnt offerings[^h5930]. 
###### 32
And the number[^h4557] of the burnt offerings[^h5930], which the congregation[^h6951] brought[^h935], was threescore and ten[^h7657] bullocks[^h1241], an hundred[^h3967] rams[^h352], and two hundred[^h3967] lambs[^h3532]: all these were for a burnt offering[^h5930] to the LORD[^h3068].
###### 33
And the consecrated things[^h6944] were six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] oxen[^h1241] and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629].
###### 34
But the priests[^h3548] were too few[^h4592], so that they could[^h3201] not flay[^h6584] all the burnt offerings[^h5930]: wherefore their brethren[^h251] the Levites[^h3881] did help[^h2388] them, till the work[^h4399] was ended[^h3615], and until the other priests[^h3548] had sanctified[^h6942] themselves: for the Levites[^h3881] were more upright[^h3477] in heart[^h3824] to sanctify[^h6942] themselves than the priests[^h3548]. 
###### 35
And also the burnt offerings[^h5930] were in abundance[^h7230], with the fat[^h2459] of the peace offerings[^h8002], and the drink offerings[^h5262] for every burnt offering[^h5930]. So the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] was set in order[^h3559].
###### 36
And Hezekiah[^h3169] rejoiced[^h8055], and all the people[^h5971], that God[^h430] had prepared[^h3559] the people[^h5971]: for the thing[^h1697] was done suddenly[^h6597].

###### 1
Then said[^h559] Solomon[^h8010], The LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h559] that he would dwell[^h7931] in the thick darkness[^h6205].
###### 2
But I have built[^h1129] an house[^h1004] of habitation[^h2073] for thee, and a place[^h4349] for thy dwelling[^h3427] for ever[^h5769].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] turned[^h5437] his face[^h6440], and blessed[^h1288] the whole congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478]: and all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478] stood[^h5975].
###### 4
And he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], who hath with his hands[^h3027] fulfilled[^h4390] that which he spake[^h1696] with his mouth[^h6310] to my father[^h1] David[^h1732], saying[^h559],
###### 5
Since the day[^h3117] that I brought forth[^h3318] my people[^h5971] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] I chose[^h977] no city[^h5892] among all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] in, that my name[^h8034] might be there; neither chose[^h977] I any man[^h376] to be a ruler[^h5057] over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]:
###### 6
But I have chosen[^h977] Jerusalem[^h3389], that my name[^h8034] might be there; and have chosen[^h977] David[^h1732] to be over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
Now it was in the heart[^h3824] of David[^h1732] my father[^h1] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
But the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to David[^h1732] my father[^h1], Forasmuch as it was in thine heart[^h3824] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for my name[^h8034], thou didst well[^h2895] in that it was in thine heart[^h3824]:
###### 9
Notwithstanding[^h7535] thou shalt not build[^h1129] the house[^h1004]; but thy son[^h1121] which shall come forth[^h3318] out of thy loins[^h2504], he shall build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] for my name[^h8034].
###### 10
The LORD[^h3068] therefore hath performed[^h6965] his word[^h1697] that he hath spoken[^h1696]: for I am risen up[^h6965] in the room of David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and am set[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478], as the LORD[^h3068] promised[^h1696], and have built[^h1129] the house[^h1004] for the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And in it[^h8033] have I put[^h7760] the ark[^h727], wherein is the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], that he made[^h3772] with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 12
And he stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] in the presence of all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], and spread forth[^h6566] his hands[^h3709]:
###### 13
For Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213] a brasen[^h5178] scaffold[^h3595], of five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] long[^h753], and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341], and three[^h7969] cubits[^h520] high[^h6967], and had set[^h5414] it in the midst[^h8432] of the court[^h5835]: and upon it he stood[^h5975], and kneeled down[^h1288] upon his knees[^h1290] before all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], and spread forth[^h6566] his hands[^h3709] toward heaven[^h8064], 
###### 14
And said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], there is no God[^h430] like thee in the heaven[^h8064], nor in the earth[^h776]; which keepest[^h8104] covenant[^h1285], and shewest mercy[^h2617] unto thy servants[^h5650], that walk[^h1980] before[^h6440] thee with all their hearts[^h3820]:
###### 15
Thou which hast kept[^h8104] with thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1] that which thou hast promised[^h1696] him; and spakest[^h1696] with thy mouth[^h6310], and hast fulfilled[^h4390] it with thine hand[^h3027], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 16
Now therefore, O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], keep[^h8104] with thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1] that which thou hast promised[^h1696] him, saying[^h559], There shall not fail[^h3772] thee a man[^h376] in my sight[^h6440] to sit[^h3427] upon the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478]; yet so[^h7535] that thy children[^h1121] take heed[^h8104] to their way[^h1870] to walk[^h3212] in my law[^h8451], as thou hast walked[^h1980] before[^h6440] me. 
###### 17
Now then, O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], let thy word[^h1697] be verified[^h539], which thou hast spoken[^h1696] unto thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732].
###### 18
But will God[^h430] in very deed[^h552] dwell[^h3427] with men[^h120] on the earth[^h776]? behold, heaven[^h8064] and the heaven[^h8064] of heavens[^h8064] cannot contain[^h3557] thee; how much less this house[^h1004] which I have built[^h1129]!
###### 19
Have respect[^h6437] therefore to the prayer[^h8605] of thy servant[^h5650], and to his supplication[^h8467], O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], to hearken[^h8085] unto the cry[^h7440] and the prayer[^h8605] which thy servant[^h5650] prayeth[^h6419] before[^h6440] thee:
###### 20
That thine eyes[^h5869] may be open[^h6605] upon this house[^h1004] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915], upon the place[^h4725] whereof thou hast said[^h559] that thou wouldest put[^h7760] thy name[^h8034] there; to hearken[^h8085] unto the prayer[^h8605] which thy servant[^h5650] prayeth[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725]. 
###### 21
Hearken[^h8085] therefore unto the supplications[^h8469] of thy servant[^h5650], and of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], which they shall make[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725]: hear[^h8085] thou from thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4725], even from heaven[^h8064]; and when thou hearest[^h8085], forgive[^h5545]. 
###### 22
If a man[^h376] sin[^h2398] against his neighbour[^h7453], and an oath[^h423] be laid[^h5375] upon him to make him swear[^h422], and the oath[^h423] come[^h935] before[^h6440] thine altar[^h4196] in this house[^h1004]; 
###### 23
Then hear[^h8085] thou from heaven[^h8064], and do[^h6213], and judge[^h8199] thy servants[^h5650], by requiting[^h7725] the wicked[^h7563], by recompensing[^h5414] his way[^h1870] upon his own head[^h7218]; and by justifying[^h6663] the righteous[^h6662], by giving[^h5414] him according to his righteousness[^h6666].
###### 24
And if thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] be put to the worse[^h5062] before[^h6440] the enemy[^h341], because they have sinned[^h2398] against thee; and shall return[^h7725] and confess[^h3034] thy name[^h8034], and pray[^h6419] and make supplication[^h2603] before[^h6440] thee in this house[^h1004];  
###### 25
Then hear[^h8085] thou from the heavens[^h8064], and forgive[^h5545] the sin[^h2403] of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and bring them again[^h7725] unto the land[^h127] which thou gavest[^h5414] to them and to their fathers[^h1].
###### 26
When the heaven[^h8064] is shut up[^h6113], and there is no rain[^h4306], because they have sinned[^h2398] against thee; yet if they pray[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725], and confess[^h3034] thy name[^h8034], and turn[^h7725] from their sin[^h2403], when thou dost afflict[^h6031] them;
###### 27
Then hear[^h8085] thou from heaven[^h8064], and forgive[^h5545] the sin[^h2403] of thy servants[^h5650], and of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], when thou hast taught[^h3384] them the good[^h2896] way[^h1870], wherein they should walk[^h3212]; and send[^h5414] rain[^h4306] upon thy land[^h776], which thou hast given[^h5414] unto thy people[^h5971] for an inheritance[^h5159].
###### 28
If there be dearth[^h7458] in the land[^h776], if there be pestilence[^h1698], if there be blasting[^h7711], or mildew[^h3420], locusts[^h697], or caterpillers[^h2625]; if their enemies[^h341] besiege[^h6887] them in the cities[^h8179] of their land[^h776]; whatsoever sore[^h5061] or whatsoever sickness[^h4245] there be: 
###### 29
Then what prayer[^h8605] or what supplication[^h8467] soever shall be made of any man[^h120], or of all thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], when every one[^h376] shall know[^h3045] his own sore[^h5061] and his own grief[^h4341], and shall spread forth[^h6566] his hands[^h3709] in this house[^h1004]: 
###### 30
Then hear[^h8085] thou from heaven[^h8064] thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], and forgive[^h5545], and render[^h5414] unto every man[^h376] according unto all his ways[^h1870], whose heart[^h3824] thou knowest[^h3045]; (for thou only knowest[^h3045] the hearts[^h3824] of the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]:)
###### 31
That they may fear[^h3372] thee, to walk[^h3212] in thy ways[^h1870], so long as[^h3117] they live[^h2416] [^h6440] in the land[^h127] which thou gavest[^h5414] unto our fathers[^h1].  
###### 32
Moreover concerning the stranger[^h5237], which is not of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], but is come[^h935] from a far[^h7350] country[^h776] for thy great[^h1419] name's[^h8034] sake, and thy mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and thy stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220]; if they come[^h935] and pray[^h6419] in this house[^h1004];
###### 33
Then hear[^h8085] thou from the heavens[^h8064], even from thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], and do[^h6213] according to all that the stranger[^h5237] calleth[^h7121] to thee for; that all people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776] may know[^h3045] thy name[^h8034], and fear[^h3372] thee, as doth thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and may know[^h3045] that this house[^h1004] which I have built[^h1129] is called[^h7121] by thy name[^h8034]. 
###### 34
If thy people[^h5971] go out[^h3318] to war[^h4421] against their enemies[^h341] by the way[^h1870] that thou shalt send[^h7971] them, and they pray[^h6419] unto thee toward[^h1870] this city[^h5892] which thou hast chosen[^h977], and the house[^h1004] which I have built[^h1129] for thy name[^h8034];
###### 35
Then hear[^h8085] thou from the heavens[^h8064] their prayer[^h8605] and their supplication[^h8467], and maintain[^h6213] their cause[^h4941]. 
###### 36
If they sin[^h2398] against thee, (for there is no man[^h120] which sinneth[^h2398] not,) and thou be angry[^h599] with them, and deliver[^h5414] them over before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341], and they carry them away[^h7617] captives[^h7617] unto a land[^h776] far off[^h7350] or near[^h7138]; 
###### 37
Yet if they bethink[^h7725] [^h3824] themselves in the land[^h776] whither they are carried captive[^h7617], and turn[^h7725] and pray[^h2603] unto thee in the land[^h776] of their captivity[^h7628], saying[^h559], We have sinned[^h2398], we have done amiss[^h5753], and have dealt wickedly[^h7561]; 
###### 38
If they return[^h7725] to thee with all their heart[^h3820] and with all their soul[^h5315] in the land[^h776] of their captivity[^h7628], whither they have carried them captives[^h7617], and pray[^h6419] toward[^h1870] their land[^h776], which thou gavest[^h5414] unto their fathers[^h1], and toward the city[^h5892] which thou hast chosen[^h977], and toward the house[^h1004] which I have built[^h1129] for thy name[^h8034]:
###### 39
Then hear[^h8085] thou from the heavens[^h8064], even from thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], their prayer[^h8605] and their supplications[^h8467], and maintain[^h6213] their cause[^h4941], and forgive[^h5545] thy people[^h5971] which have sinned[^h2398] against thee. 
###### 40
Now, my God[^h430], let, I beseech thee, thine eyes[^h5869] be open[^h6605], and let thine ears[^h241] be attent[^h7183] unto the prayer[^h8605] that is made in this place[^h4725]. 
###### 41
Now therefore arise[^h6965], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], into thy resting[^h5118] place, thou, and the ark[^h727] of thy strength[^h5797]: let thy priests[^h3548], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], be clothed[^h3847] with salvation[^h8668], and let thy saints[^h2623] rejoice[^h8055] in goodness[^h2896].
###### 42
O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], turn not away[^h7725] the face[^h6440] of thine anointed[^h4899]: remember[^h2142] the mercies[^h2617] of David[^h1732] thy servant[^h5650].

###### 1
And the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] came upon Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Oded[^h5752]:
###### 2
And he went out[^h3318] to meet[^h6440] Asa[^h609], and said[^h559] unto him, Hear[^h8085] ye me, Asa[^h609], and all Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144]; The LORD[^h3068] is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek[^h1875] him, he will be found[^h4672] of you; but if ye forsake[^h5800] him, he will forsake[^h5800] you. 
###### 3
Now for a long[^h7227] season[^h3117] Israel[^h3478] hath been without[^h3808] the true[^h571] God[^h430], and without a teaching[^h3384] priest[^h3548], and without law[^h8451].
###### 4
But when they in their trouble[^h6862] did turn[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], and sought[^h1245] him, he was found[^h4672] of them.
###### 5
And in those times[^h6256] there was no peace[^h7965] to him that went out[^h3318], nor to him that came in[^h935], but great[^h7227] vexations[^h4103] were upon all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the countries[^h776].
###### 6
And nation[^h1471] was destroyed[^h3807] of nation[^h1471], and city[^h5892] of city[^h5892]: for God[^h430] did vex[^h2000] them with all adversity[^h6869]. 
###### 7
Be ye strong[^h2388] therefore, and let not your hands[^h3027] be weak[^h7503]: for your work[^h6468] shall be[^h3426] rewarded[^h7939].
###### 8
And when Asa[^h609] heard[^h8085] these words[^h1697], and the prophecy[^h5016] of Oded[^h5752] the prophet[^h5030], he took courage[^h2388], and put away[^h5674] the abominable idols[^h8251] out of all the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], and out of the cities[^h5892] which he had taken[^h3920] from mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and renewed[^h2318] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], that was before[^h6440] the porch[^h197] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 9
And he gathered[^h6908] all Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], and the strangers[^h1481] with them out of Ephraim[^h669] and Manasseh[^h4519], and out of Simeon[^h8095]: for they fell[^h5307] to him out of Israel[^h3478] in abundance[^h7230], when they saw[^h7200] that the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] was with him.
###### 10
So they gathered themselves together[^h6908] at Jerusalem[^h3389] in the third[^h7992] month[^h2320], in the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of Asa[^h609].
###### 11
And they offered[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] the same time[^h3117], of the spoil[^h7998] which they had brought[^h935], seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] oxen[^h1241] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629]. 
###### 12
And they entered[^h935] into a covenant[^h1285] to seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1] with all their heart[^h3824] and with all their soul[^h5315];
###### 13
That whosoever would not seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] should be put to death[^h4191], whether[^h4480] small[^h6996] or great[^h1419], whether man[^h376] or woman[^h802].
###### 14
And they sware[^h7650] unto the LORD[^h3068] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], and with shouting[^h8643], and with trumpets[^h2689], and with cornets[^h7782].
###### 15
And all Judah[^h3063] rejoiced[^h8055] at the oath[^h7621]: for they had sworn[^h7650] with all their heart[^h3824], and sought[^h1245] him with their whole desire[^h7522]; and he was found[^h4672] of them: and the LORD[^h3068] gave them rest[^h5117] round about[^h5439].
###### 16
And also concerning Maachah[^h4601] the mother[^h517] of Asa[^h609] the king[^h4428], he removed[^h5493] her from being queen[^h1377], because she had made[^h6213] an idol[^h4656] in a grove[^h842]: and Asa[^h609] cut down[^h3772] her idol[^h4656], and stamped[^h1854] it, and burnt[^h8313] it at the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939].  
###### 17
But the high places[^h1116] were not taken away[^h5493] out of Israel[^h3478]: nevertheless the heart[^h3824] of Asa[^h609] was perfect[^h8003] all his days[^h3117].
###### 18
And he brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] the things that his father[^h1] had dedicated[^h6944], and that he himself had dedicated[^h6944], silver[^h3701], and gold[^h2091], and vessels[^h3627].
###### 19
And there was no more war[^h4421] unto the five[^h2568] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of Asa[^h609].

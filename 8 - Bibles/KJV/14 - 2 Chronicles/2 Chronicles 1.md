###### 1
And Solomon[^h8010] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] was strengthened[^h2388] in his kingdom[^h4438], and the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] was with him, and magnified[^h1431] him exceedingly[^h4605].
###### 2
Then Solomon[^h8010] spake[^h559] unto all Israel[^h3478], to the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505] and of hundreds[^h3967], and to the judges[^h8199], and to every governor[^h5387] in all Israel[^h3478], the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1].
###### 3
So Solomon[^h8010], and all the congregation[^h6951] with him, went[^h3212] to the high place[^h1116] that was at Gibeon[^h1391]; for there was the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] of God[^h430], which Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h6213] in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 4
But[^h61] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] had David[^h1732] brought up[^h5927] from Kirjathjearim[^h7157] to the place which David[^h1732] had prepared[^h3559] for it: for he had pitched[^h5186] a tent[^h168] for it at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 5
Moreover the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196], that Bezaleel[^h1212] the son[^h1121] of Uri[^h221], the son[^h1121] of Hur[^h2354], had made[^h6213], he put[^h7760] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068]: and Solomon[^h8010] and the congregation[^h6951] sought[^h1875] unto it. 
###### 6
And Solomon[^h8010] went up[^h5927] thither to the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], which was at the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and offered[^h5927] a thousand[^h505] burnt offerings[^h5930] upon it.
###### 7
In that night[^h3915] did God[^h430] appear[^h7200] unto Solomon[^h8010], and said[^h559] unto him, Ask[^h7592] what I shall give[^h5414] thee.
###### 8
And Solomon[^h8010] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], Thou hast shewed[^h6213] great[^h1419] mercy[^h2617] unto David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and hast made me to reign[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 9
Now, O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], let thy promise[^h1697] unto David[^h1732] my father[^h1] be established[^h539]: for thou hast made me king[^h4427] over a people[^h5971] like the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776] in multitude[^h7227]. 
###### 10
Give[^h5414] me now wisdom[^h2451] and knowledge[^h4093], that I may go out[^h3318] and come in[^h935] before[^h6440] this people[^h5971]: for who can judge[^h8199] this thy people[^h5971], that is so great[^h1419]?
###### 11
And God[^h430] said[^h559] to Solomon[^h8010], Because this was in thine heart[^h3824], and thou hast not asked[^h7592] riches[^h6239], wealth[^h5233], or honour[^h3519], nor the life[^h5315] of thine enemies[^h8130], neither yet hast asked[^h7592] long[^h7227] life[^h3117]; but hast asked[^h7592] wisdom[^h2451] and knowledge[^h4093] for thyself, that thou mayest judge[^h8199] my people[^h5971], over whom I have made thee king[^h4427]:
###### 12
Wisdom[^h2451] and knowledge[^h4093] is granted[^h5414] unto thee; and I will give[^h5414] thee riches[^h6239], and wealth[^h5233], and honour[^h3519], such as none of the kings[^h4428] have had that have been before[^h6440] thee, neither shall there any after[^h310] thee have the like.
###### 13
Then Solomon[^h8010] came[^h935] from his journey to the high place[^h1116] that was at Gibeon[^h1391] to Jerusalem[^h3389], from before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
And Solomon[^h8010] gathered[^h622] chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571]: and he had a thousand[^h505] and four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h7393], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571], which he placed[^h3240] in the chariot[^h7393] cities[^h5892], and with the king[^h4428] at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 15
And the king[^h4428] made[^h5414] silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091] at Jerusalem[^h3389] as plenteous as stones[^h68], and cedar trees[^h730] made[^h5414] he as the sycomore trees[^h8256] that are in the vale[^h8219] for abundance[^h7230]. 
###### 16
And Solomon[^h8010] had horses[^h5483] brought[^h4161] out of Egypt[^h4714], and linen yarn[^h4723]: the king's[^h4428] merchants[^h5503] received[^h3947] the linen yarn[^h4723] at a price[^h4242]. 
###### 17
And they fetched up[^h5927], and brought forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714] a chariot[^h4818] for six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701], and an horse[^h5483] for an hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572]: and so brought they out[^h3318] horses for all the kings[^h4428] of the Hittites[^h2850], and for the kings[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], by their means[^h3027].

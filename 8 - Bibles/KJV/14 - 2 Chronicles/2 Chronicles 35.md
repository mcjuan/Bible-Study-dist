###### 1
Moreover Josiah[^h2977] kept[^h6213] a passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: and they killed[^h7819] the passover[^h6453] on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320].
###### 2
And he set[^h5975] the priests[^h3548] in their charges[^h4931], and encouraged[^h2388] them to the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068],
###### 3
And said[^h559] unto the Levites[^h3881] that taught[^h995] [^h4000] all Israel[^h3478], which were holy[^h6918] unto the LORD[^h3068], Put[^h5414] the holy[^h6944] ark[^h727] in the house[^h1004] which Solomon[^h8010] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] did build[^h1129]; it shall not be a burden[^h4853] upon your shoulders[^h3802]: serve[^h5647] now the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478],
###### 4
And prepare[^h3559] [^h3559] yourselves by the houses[^h1004] of your fathers[^h1], after your courses[^h4256], according to the writing[^h3791] of David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and according to the writing[^h4385] of Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121].
###### 5
And stand in[^h5975] the holy[^h6944] place according to the divisions[^h6391] of the families[^h1004] of the fathers[^h1] of your brethren[^h251] the people[^h1121] [^h5971], and after the division[^h2515] of the families[^h1] [^h1004] of the Levites[^h3881].  
###### 6
So kill[^h7819] the passover[^h6453], and sanctify[^h6942] yourselves, and prepare[^h3559] your brethren[^h251], that they may do[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 7
And Josiah[^h2977] gave[^h7311] to the people[^h1121] [^h5971], of the flock[^h6629], lambs[^h3532] and kids[^h1121] [^h5795], all for the passover offerings[^h6453], for all that were present[^h4672], to the number[^h4557] of thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505], and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] bullocks[^h1241]: these were of the king's[^h4428] substance[^h7399]. 
###### 8
And his princes[^h8269] gave[^h7311] willingly[^h5071] unto the people[^h5971], to the priests[^h3548], and to the Levites[^h3881]: Hilkiah[^h2518] and Zechariah[^h2148] and Jehiel[^h3171], rulers[^h5057] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], gave[^h5414] unto the priests[^h3548] for the passover offerings[^h6453] two thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] small cattle, and three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] oxen[^h1241]. 
###### 9
Conaniah[^h3562] also, and Shemaiah[^h8098] and Nethaneel[^h5417], his brethren[^h251], and Hashabiah[^h2811] and Jeiel[^h3273] and Jozabad[^h3107], chief[^h8269] of the Levites[^h3881], gave[^h7311] unto the Levites[^h3881] for passover offerings[^h6453] five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] small cattle, and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] oxen[^h1241]. 
###### 10
So the service[^h5656] was prepared[^h3559], and the priests[^h3548] stood[^h5975] in their place[^h5977], and the Levites[^h3881] in their courses[^h4256], according to the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h4687].
###### 11
And they killed[^h7819] the passover[^h6453], and the priests[^h3548] sprinkled[^h2236] the blood from their hands[^h3027], and the Levites[^h3881] flayed[^h6584] them.
###### 12
And they removed[^h5493] the burnt offerings[^h5930], that they might give[^h5414] according to the divisions[^h4653] of the families[^h1] [^h1004] of the people[^h1121] [^h5971], to offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068], as it is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of Moses[^h4872]. And so did they with the oxen[^h1241].
###### 13
And they roasted[^h1310] the passover[^h6453] with fire[^h784] according to the ordinance[^h4941]: but the other holy[^h6944] offerings sod[^h1310] they in pots[^h5518], and in caldrons[^h1731], and in pans[^h6745], and divided them speedily[^h7323] among all the people[^h1121] [^h5971]. 
###### 14
And afterward[^h310] they made ready[^h3559] for themselves, and for the priests[^h3548]: because the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] were busied in offering[^h5927] of burnt offerings[^h5930] and the fat[^h2459] until night[^h3915]; therefore the Levites[^h3881] prepared[^h3559] for themselves, and for the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175].
###### 15
And the singers[^h7891] the sons[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623] were in their place[^h4612], according to the commandment[^h4687] of David[^h1732], and Asaph[^h623], and Heman[^h1968], and Jeduthun[^h3038] the king's[^h4428] seer[^h2374]; and the porters[^h7778] waited at every gate[^h8179]; they might not depart[^h5493] from their service[^h5656]; for their brethren[^h251] the Levites[^h3881] prepared[^h3559] for them. 
###### 16
So all the service[^h5656] of the LORD[^h3068] was prepared[^h3559] the same day[^h3117], to keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453], and to offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] upon the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], according to the commandment[^h4687] of king[^h4428] Josiah[^h2977].
###### 17
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] that were present[^h4672] kept[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] at that time[^h6256], and the feast[^h2282] of unleavened bread[^h4682] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]. 
###### 18
And there was no passover[^h6453] like[^h3644] to that kept[^h6213] in Israel[^h3478] from the days[^h3117] of Samuel[^h8050] the prophet[^h5030]; neither did[^h6213] all the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] keep[^h6213] such a passover[^h6453] as Josiah[^h2977] kept[^h6213], and the priests[^h3548], and the Levites[^h3881], and all Judah[^h3063] and Israel[^h3478] that were present[^h4672], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 19
In the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of Josiah[^h2977] was this passover[^h6453] kept[^h6213].
###### 20
After[^h310] all this, when Josiah[^h2977] had prepared[^h3559] the temple[^h1004], Necho[^h5224] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] came up[^h5927] to fight[^h3898] against Carchemish[^h3751] by Euphrates[^h6578]: and Josiah[^h2977] went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] him. 
###### 21
But he sent[^h7971] ambassadors[^h4397] to him, saying[^h559], What have I to do with thee, thou king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]? I come not against thee this day[^h3117], but against the house[^h1004] wherewith I have war[^h4421]: for God[^h430] commanded[^h559] me to make haste[^h926]: forbear[^h2308] thee from meddling with God[^h430], who is with me, that he destroy[^h7843] thee not. 
###### 22
Nevertheless Josiah[^h2977] would not turn[^h5437] his face[^h6440] from him, but disguised[^h2664] himself, that he might fight[^h3898] with him, and hearkened[^h8085] not unto the words[^h1697] of Necho[^h5224] from the mouth[^h6310] of God[^h430], and came[^h935] to fight[^h3898] in the valley[^h1237] of Megiddo[^h4023].
###### 23
And the archers[^h3384] shot[^h3384] at king[^h4428] Josiah[^h2977]; and the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to his servants[^h5650], Have me away[^h5674]; for I am sore[^h3966] wounded[^h2470]. 
###### 24
His servants[^h5650] therefore took[^h5674] him out of that chariot[^h4818], and put[^h7392] him in the second[^h4932] chariot[^h7393] that he had; and they brought[^h3212] him to Jerusalem[^h3389], and he died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in one of the sepulchres[^h6913] of his fathers[^h1]. And all Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] mourned[^h56] for Josiah[^h2977]. 
###### 25
And Jeremiah[^h3414] lamented[^h6969] for Josiah[^h2977]: and all the singing men[^h7891] and the singing women[^h7891] spake[^h559] of Josiah[^h2977] in their lamentations[^h7015] to this day[^h3117], and made[^h5414] them an ordinance[^h2706] in Israel[^h3478]: and, behold, they are written[^h3789] in the lamentations[^h7015].
###### 26
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Josiah[^h2977], and his goodness[^h2617], according to that which was written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068], 
###### 27
And his deeds[^h1697], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063].

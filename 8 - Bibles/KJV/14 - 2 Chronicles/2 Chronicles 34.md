###### 1
Josiah[^h2977] was eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] one[^h259] and thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and walked[^h3212] in the ways[^h1870] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1], and declined[^h5493] neither to the right hand[^h3225], nor to the left[^h8040].
###### 3
For in the eighth[^h8083] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], while he was yet young[^h5288], he began[^h2490] to seek[^h1875] after the God[^h430] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: and in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141] he began[^h2490] to purge[^h2891] Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] from the high places[^h1116], and the groves[^h842], and the carved images[^h6456], and the molten images[^h4541].
###### 4
And they brake down[^h5422] the altars[^h4196] of Baalim[^h1168] in his presence[^h6440]; and the images[^h2553], that were on high above them[^h4605], he cut down[^h1438]; and the groves[^h842], and the carved images[^h6456], and the molten images[^h4541], he brake in pieces[^h7665], and made dust[^h1854] of them, and strowed[^h2236] it upon[^h6440] the graves[^h6913] of them that had sacrificed[^h2076] unto them.  
###### 5
And he burnt[^h8313] the bones[^h6106] of the priests[^h3548] upon their altars[^h4196], and cleansed[^h2891] Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 6
And so did he in the cities[^h5892] of Manasseh[^h4519], and Ephraim[^h669], and Simeon[^h8095], even unto Naphtali[^h5321], with their mattocks[^h2719] round about[^h5439]. 
###### 7
And when he had broken down[^h5422] the altars[^h4196] and the groves[^h842], and had beaten[^h3807] the graven images[^h6456] into powder[^h1854], and cut down[^h1438] all the idols[^h2553] throughout all the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478], he returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 8
Now in the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], when he had purged[^h2891] the land[^h776], and the house[^h1004], he sent[^h7971] Shaphan[^h8227] the son[^h1121] of Azaliah[^h683], and Maaseiah[^h4641] the governor[^h8269] of the city[^h5892], and Joah[^h3098] the son[^h1121] of Joahaz[^h3099] the recorder[^h2142], to repair[^h2388] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430].
###### 9
And when they came[^h935] to Hilkiah[^h2518] the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548], they delivered[^h5414] the money[^h3701] that was brought[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], which the Levites[^h3881] that kept[^h8104] the doors[^h5592] had gathered[^h622] of the hand[^h3027] of Manasseh[^h4519] and Ephraim[^h669], and of all the remnant[^h7611] of Israel[^h3478], and of all Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144]; and they returned[^h7725] [^h3427] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 10
And they put[^h5414] it in the hand[^h3027] of the workmen[^h6213] [^h4399] that had the oversight[^h6485] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and they gave[^h5414] it to the workmen[^h6213] [^h4399] that wrought[^h6213] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], to repair[^h918] and amend[^h2388] the house[^h1004]:
###### 11
Even to the artificers[^h2796] and builders[^h1129] gave[^h5414] they it, to buy[^h7069] hewn[^h4274] stone[^h68], and timber[^h6086] for couplings[^h4226], and to floor[^h7136] the houses[^h1004] which the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had destroyed[^h7843]. 
###### 12
And the men[^h582] did[^h6213] the work[^h4399] faithfully[^h530]: and the overseers[^h5329] of them were Jahath[^h3189] and Obadiah[^h5662], the Levites[^h3881], of the sons[^h1121] of Merari[^h4847]; and Zechariah[^h2148] and Meshullam[^h4918], of the sons of the Kohathites[^h6956], to set it forward[^h6485]; and other of the Levites[^h3881], all that could skill[^h995] of instruments[^h3627] of musick[^h7892].
###### 13
Also they were over the bearers of burdens[^h5449], and were overseers[^h5329] of all that wrought[^h6213] the work[^h4399] in any manner of service[^h5656]: and of the Levites[^h3881] there were scribes[^h5608], and officers[^h7860], and porters[^h7778].
###### 14
And when they brought out[^h3318] the money[^h3701] that was brought into[^h935] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548] found[^h4672] a book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] given by[^h3027] Moses[^h4872]. 
###### 15
And Hilkiah[^h2518] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] to Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608], I have found[^h4672] the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And Hilkiah[^h2518] delivered[^h5414] the book[^h5612] to Shaphan[^h8227].
###### 16
And Shaphan[^h8227] carried[^h935] the book[^h5612] to the king[^h4428], and brought[^h7725] the king[^h4428] word[^h1697] back[^h7725] again, saying[^h559], All that was committed[^h5414] to[^h3027] thy servants[^h5650], they do[^h6213] it. 
###### 17
And they have gathered together[^h5413] the money[^h3701] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and have delivered[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of the overseers[^h6485], and to the hand[^h3027] of the workmen[^h6213] [^h4399]. 
###### 18
Then Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608] told[^h5046] the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Hilkiah[^h2518] the priest[^h3548] hath given[^h5414] me a book[^h5612]. And Shaphan[^h8227] read[^h7121] it before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 19
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] had heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the law[^h8451], that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899].
###### 20
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Hilkiah[^h2518], and Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], and Abdon[^h5658] the son[^h1121] of Micah[^h4318], and Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608], and Asaiah[^h6222] a servant[^h5650] of the king's[^h4428], saying[^h559], 
###### 21
Go[^h3212], enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068] for me, and for them that are left[^h7604] in Israel[^h3478] and in Judah[^h3063], concerning the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] that is found[^h4672]: for great[^h1419] is the wrath[^h2534] of the LORD[^h3068] that is poured out[^h5413] upon us, because our fathers[^h1] have not kept[^h8104] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], to do[^h6213] after all that is written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612].
###### 22
And Hilkiah[^h2518], and they that the king[^h4428] had appointed, went[^h3212] to Huldah[^h2468] the prophetess[^h5031], the wife[^h802] of Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Tikvath[^h8616] [^h8445], the son[^h1121] of Hasrah[^h2641], keeper[^h8104] of the wardrobe[^h899]; (now she dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] in the college[^h4932]:) and they spake[^h1696] to her to that effect.   
###### 23
And she answered[^h559] them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Tell[^h559] ye the man[^h376] that sent[^h7971] you to me,
###### 24
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon this place[^h4725], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof, even all the curses[^h423] that are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] which they have read[^h7121] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]:
###### 25
Because they have forsaken[^h5800] me, and have burned incense[^h6999] [^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], that they might provoke me to anger[^h3707] with all the works[^h4639] of their hands[^h3027]; therefore my wrath[^h2534] shall be poured out[^h5413] upon this place[^h4725], and shall not be quenched[^h3518].
###### 26
And as for[^h413] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], who sent[^h7971] you to enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068], so shall ye say[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] concerning the words[^h1697] which thou hast heard[^h8085];
###### 27
Because thine heart[^h3824] was tender[^h7401], and thou didst humble[^h3665] thyself before[^h6440] God[^h430], when thou heardest[^h8085] his words[^h1697] against this place[^h4725], and against the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof, and humbledst[^h3665] thyself before[^h6440] me, and didst rend[^h7167] thy clothes[^h899], and weep[^h1058] before[^h6440] me; I have even heard[^h8085] thee also, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 28
Behold, I will gather[^h622] thee to thy fathers[^h1], and thou shalt be gathered[^h622] to thy grave[^h6913] in peace[^h7965], neither shall thine eyes[^h5869] see[^h7200] all the evil[^h7451] that I will bring[^h935] upon this place[^h4725], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] of the same. So they brought[^h7725] the king[^h4428] word[^h1697] again[^h7725].
###### 29
Then the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] and gathered together[^h622] all the elders[^h2205] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 30
And the king[^h4428] went up[^h5927] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and all the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and the priests[^h3548], and the Levites[^h3881], and all the people[^h5971], great[^h1419] and small[^h6996]: and he read[^h7121] in their ears[^h241] all the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] of the covenant[^h1285] that was found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 31
And the king[^h4428] stood[^h5975] in his place[^h5977], and made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to walk[^h3212] after[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687], and his testimonies[^h5715], and his statutes[^h2706], with all his heart[^h3824], and with all his soul[^h5315], to perform[^h6213] the words[^h1697] of the covenant[^h1285] which are written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612].
###### 32
And he caused all that were present[^h4672] in Jerusalem[^h3389] and Benjamin[^h1144] to stand[^h5975] to it. And the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] did[^h6213] according to the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430], the God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 33
And Josiah[^h2977] took away[^h5493] all the abominations[^h8441] out of all the countries[^h776] that pertained to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and made all that were present[^h4672] in Israel[^h3478] to serve[^h5647], even to serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430]. And all his days[^h3117] they departed[^h5493] not from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1].

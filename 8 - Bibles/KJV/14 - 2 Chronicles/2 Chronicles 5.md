###### 1
Thus all the work[^h4399] that Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] was finished[^h7999]: and Solomon[^h8010] brought[^h935] in all the things[^h6944] that David[^h1732] his father[^h1] had dedicated[^h6944]; and the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and all the instruments[^h3627], put[^h5414] he among the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].
###### 2
Then Solomon[^h8010] assembled[^h6950] the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and all the heads[^h7218] of the tribes[^h4294], the chief[^h5387] of the fathers[^h1] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], unto Jerusalem[^h3389], to bring up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] out of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], which is Zion[^h6726].
###### 3
Wherefore all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] assembled[^h6950] themselves unto the king[^h4428] in the feast[^h2282] which was in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320].
###### 4
And all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935]; and the Levites[^h3881] took up[^h5375] the ark[^h727].
###### 5
And they brought up[^h5927] the ark[^h727], and the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and all the holy[^h6944] vessels[^h3627] that were in the tabernacle[^h168], these did the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] bring up[^h5927].
###### 6
Also king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010], and all the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478] that were assembled[^h3259] unto him before[^h6440] the ark[^h727], sacrificed[^h2076] sheep[^h6629] and oxen[^h1241], which could not be told[^h5608] nor numbered[^h4487] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 7
And the priests[^h3548] brought in[^h935] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] unto his place[^h4725], to the oracle[^h1687] of the house[^h1004], into the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place, even under the wings[^h3671] of the cherubims[^h3742]:
###### 8
For the cherubims[^h3742] spread forth[^h6566] their wings[^h3671] over the place[^h4725] of the ark[^h727], and the cherubims[^h3742] covered[^h3680] the ark[^h727] and the staves[^h905] thereof above[^h4605].
###### 9
And they drew out[^h748] the staves[^h905] of the ark, that the ends[^h7218] of the staves[^h905] were seen[^h7200] from the ark[^h727] before[^h6440] the oracle[^h1687]; but they were not seen[^h7200] without[^h2351]. And there it is unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 10
There was nothing in the ark[^h727] save the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] which Moses[^h4872] put[^h5414] therein at Horeb[^h2722], when the LORD[^h3068] made[^h3772] a covenant with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], when they came out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 11
And it came to pass, when the priests[^h3548] were come out[^h3318] of the holy[^h6944] place: (for all the priests[^h3548] that were present[^h4672] were sanctified[^h6942], and did not then wait[^h8104] by course[^h4256]: 
###### 12
Also the Levites[^h3881] which were the singers[^h7891], all of them of Asaph[^h623], of Heman[^h1968], of Jeduthun[^h3038], with their sons[^h1121] and their brethren[^h251], being arrayed[^h3847] in white linen[^h948], having cymbals[^h4700] and psalteries[^h5035] and harps[^h3658], stood[^h5975] at the east end[^h4217] of the altar[^h4196], and with them an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] priests[^h3548] sounding[^h2690] with trumpets[^h2689]:)
###### 13
It came even to pass, as the trumpeters[^h2690] [^h2690] and singers[^h7891] were as one[^h259], to make one[^h259] sound[^h6963] to be heard[^h8085] in praising[^h1984] and thanking[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068]; and when they lifted up[^h7311] their voice[^h6963] with the trumpets[^h2689] and cymbals[^h4700] and instruments[^h3627] of musick[^h7892], and praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068], saying, For he is good[^h2896]; for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769]: that then the house[^h1004] was filled[^h4390] with a cloud[^h6051], even the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068];
###### 14
So that the priests[^h3548] could[^h3201] not stand[^h5975] to minister[^h8334] by reason[^h6440] of the cloud[^h6051]: for the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] had filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].

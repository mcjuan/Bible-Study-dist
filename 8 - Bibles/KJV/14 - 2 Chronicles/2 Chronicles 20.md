###### 1
It came to pass after this[^h310] also, that the children[^h1121] of Moab[^h4124], and the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and with them other beside the Ammonites[^h5984], came[^h935] against Jehoshaphat[^h3092] to battle[^h4421].
###### 2
Then there came[^h935] some that told[^h5046] Jehoshaphat[^h3092], saying[^h559], There cometh[^h935] a great[^h7227] multitude[^h1995] against thee from beyond[^h5676] the sea[^h3220] on this side Syria[^h758]; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar[^h2688], which is Engedi[^h5872].
###### 3
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] feared[^h3372], and set[^h5414] himself[^h6440] to seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068], and proclaimed[^h7121] a fast[^h6685] throughout[^h5921] all Judah[^h3063]. 
###### 4
And Judah[^h3063] gathered themselves together[^h6908], to ask[^h1245] help of the LORD[^h3068]: even out of all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] they came[^h935] to seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] stood[^h5975] in the congregation[^h6951] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], before[^h6440] the new[^h2319] court[^h2691],
###### 6
And said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of our fathers[^h1], art not thou God[^h430] in heaven[^h8064]? and rulest[^h4910] not thou over all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the heathen[^h1471]? and in thine hand[^h3027] is there not power[^h3581] and might[^h1369], so that none is able to withstand[^h3320] thee?
###### 7
Art not thou our God[^h430], who didst drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants[^h3427] of this land[^h776] before[^h6440] thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and gavest[^h5414] it to the seed[^h2233] of Abraham[^h85] thy friend[^h157] for ever[^h5769]? 
###### 8
And they dwelt[^h3427] therein, and have built[^h1129] thee a sanctuary[^h4720] therein for thy name[^h8034], saying[^h559],
###### 9
If, when evil[^h7451] cometh[^h935] upon us, as the sword[^h2719], judgment[^h8196], or pestilence[^h1698], or famine[^h7458], we stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] this house[^h1004], and in thy presence[^h6440], (for thy name[^h8034] is in this house[^h1004],) and cry[^h2199] unto thee in our affliction[^h6869], then thou wilt hear[^h8085] and help[^h3467].
###### 10
And now, behold, the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] and Moab[^h4124] and mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], whom thou wouldest not let[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] invade[^h935], when they came out[^h935] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], but they turned[^h5493] from them, and destroyed[^h8045] them not;
###### 11
Behold, I say, how they reward[^h1580] us, to come[^h935] to cast us out[^h1644] of thy possession[^h3425], which thou hast given us to inherit[^h3423].
###### 12
O our God[^h430], wilt thou not judge[^h8199] them? for we have no might[^h3581] against[^h6440] this great[^h7227] company[^h1995] that cometh[^h935] against us; neither know[^h3045] we[^h587] what to do[^h6213]: but our eyes[^h5869] are upon thee.
###### 13
And all Judah[^h3063] stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], with[^h1571] their little ones[^h2945], their wives[^h802], and their children[^h1121].
###### 14
Then upon Jahaziel[^h3166] the son[^h1121] of Zechariah[^h2148], the son[^h1121] of Benaiah[^h1141], the son[^h1121] of Jeiel[^h3273], the son[^h1121] of Mattaniah[^h4983], a Levite[^h3881] of the sons[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623], came the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] in the midst[^h8432] of the congregation[^h6951];
###### 15
And he said[^h559], Hearken[^h7181] ye, all Judah[^h3063], and ye inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and thou king[^h4428] Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] unto you, Be not afraid[^h3372] nor dismayed[^h2865] by reason[^h6440] of this great[^h7227] multitude[^h1995]; for the battle[^h4421] is not yours, but God's[^h430].
###### 16
To morrow[^h4279] go ye down[^h3381] against them: behold, they come up[^h5927] by the cliff[^h4608] of Ziz[^h6732]; and ye shall find[^h4672] them at the end[^h5490] of the brook[^h5158], before[^h6440] the wilderness[^h4057] of Jeruel[^h3385].  
###### 17
Ye shall not need to fight[^h3898] in this[^h2063] battle: set[^h3320] yourselves, stand[^h5975] ye still, and see[^h7200] the salvation[^h3444] of the LORD[^h3068] with you, O Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389]: fear[^h3372] not, nor be dismayed[^h2865]; to morrow[^h4279] go out[^h3318] against[^h6440] them: for the LORD[^h3068] will be with you.
###### 18
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] bowed[^h6915] his head with his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776]: and all Judah[^h3063] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] fell[^h5307] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], worshipping[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
And the Levites[^h3881], of the children[^h1121] of the Kohathites[^h6956], and of the children[^h1121] of the Korhites[^h7145], stood up[^h6965] to praise[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963] on high[^h4605].
###### 20
And they rose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and went forth[^h3318] into the wilderness[^h4057] of Tekoa[^h8620]: and as they went forth[^h3318], Jehoshaphat[^h3092] stood[^h5975] and said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] me, O Judah[^h3063], and ye inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389]; Believe[^h539] in the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], so shall ye be established[^h539]; believe[^h539] his prophets[^h5030], so shall ye prosper[^h6743].
###### 21
And when he had consulted[^h3289] with the people[^h5971], he appointed[^h5975] singers[^h7891] unto the LORD[^h3068], and that should praise[^h1984] the beauty[^h1927] of holiness[^h6944], as they went out[^h3318] before[^h6440] the army[^h2502], and to say[^h559], Praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068]; for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769]. 
###### 22
And when[^h6256] they began[^h2490] to sing[^h7440] and to praise[^h8416], the LORD[^h3068] set[^h5414] ambushments[^h693] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], Moab[^h4124], and mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], which were come[^h935] against Judah[^h3063]; and they were smitten[^h5062].   
###### 23
For the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] and Moab[^h4124] stood up[^h5975] against the inhabitants[^h3427] of mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], utterly to slay[^h2763] and destroy[^h8045] them: and when they had made an end[^h3615] of the inhabitants[^h3427] of Seir[^h8165], every one[^h376] helped[^h5826] to destroy[^h4889] another[^h7453]. 
###### 24
And when Judah[^h3063] came[^h935] toward the watch tower[^h4707] [^h4708] in the wilderness[^h4057], they looked[^h6437] unto the multitude[^h1995], and, behold, they were dead bodies[^h6297] fallen[^h5307] to the earth[^h776], and none escaped[^h6413]. 
###### 25
And when Jehoshaphat[^h3092] and his people[^h5971] came[^h935] to take away[^h962] the spoil[^h7998] of them, they found[^h4672] among them in abundance[^h7230] both riches[^h7399] with the dead bodies[^h6297], and precious[^h2532] jewels[^h3627], which they stripped off[^h5337] for themselves, more than[^h369] they could carry away[^h4853]: and they were three[^h7969] days[^h3117] in gathering[^h962] of the spoil[^h7998], it was so much[^h7227].
###### 26
And on the fourth[^h7243] day[^h3117] they assembled[^h6950] themselves in the valley[^h6010] of Berachah[^h1294]; for there they blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068]: therefore the name[^h8034] of the same place[^h4725] was called[^h7121], The valley[^h6010] of Berachah[^h1294], unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 27
Then they returned[^h7725], every man[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] in the forefront[^h7218] of them, to go again[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389] with joy[^h8057]; for the LORD[^h3068] had made them to rejoice[^h8055] over their enemies[^h341]. 
###### 28
And they came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389] with psalteries[^h5035] and harps[^h3658] and trumpets[^h2689] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 29
And the fear[^h6343] of God[^h430] was on all the kingdoms[^h4467] of those countries[^h776], when they had heard[^h8085] that the LORD[^h3068] fought[^h3898] against the enemies[^h341] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 30
So the realm[^h4438] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] was quiet[^h8252]: for his God[^h430] gave him rest[^h5117] round about[^h5439].
###### 31
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] reigned[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063]: he was thirty[^h7970] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Azubah[^h5806] the daughter[^h1323] of Shilhi[^h7977].
###### 32
And he walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of Asa[^h609] his father[^h1], and departed[^h5493] not from it, doing[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 33
Howbeit the high places[^h1116] were not taken away[^h5493]: for as yet the people[^h5971] had not prepared[^h3559] their hearts[^h3824] unto the God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1].
###### 34
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h1697] of Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Hanani[^h2607], who is mentioned[^h5927] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].  
###### 35
And after[^h310] this did Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] join[^h2266] himself with Ahaziah[^h274] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], who did[^h6213] very wickedly[^h7561]:
###### 36
And he joined[^h2266] himself with him to make[^h6213] ships[^h591] to go[^h3212] to Tarshish[^h8659]: and they made[^h6213] the ships[^h591] in Eziongeber[^h6100].
###### 37
Then Eliezer[^h461] the son[^h1121] of Dodavah[^h1735] of Mareshah[^h4762] prophesied[^h5012] against Jehoshaphat[^h3092], saying[^h559], Because thou hast joined[^h2266] thyself with Ahaziah[^h274], the LORD[^h3068] hath broken[^h6555] thy works[^h4639]. And the ships[^h591] were broken[^h7665], that they were not able[^h6113] to go[^h3212] to Tarshish[^h8659].

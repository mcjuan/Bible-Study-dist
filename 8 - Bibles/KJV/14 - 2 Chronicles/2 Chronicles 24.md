###### 1
Joash[^h3101] was seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] forty[^h705] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. His mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] also was Zibiah[^h6645] of Beersheba[^h884].
###### 2
And Joash[^h3101] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] all the days[^h3117] of Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548].
###### 3
And Jehoiada[^h3077] took[^h5375] for him two[^h8147] wives[^h802]; and he begat[^h3205] sons[^h1121] and daughters[^h1323].
###### 4
And it came to pass after[^h310] this, that Joash[^h3101] was minded[^h3820] to repair[^h2318] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 5
And he gathered together[^h6908] the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and said[^h559] to them, Go out[^h3318] unto the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and gather[^h6908] of all Israel[^h3478] money[^h3701] to repair[^h2388] the house[^h1004] of your God[^h430] from[^h1767] year[^h8141] to year[^h8141], and see that ye hasten[^h4116] the matter[^h1697]. Howbeit the Levites[^h3881] hastened[^h4116] it not.
###### 6
And the king[^h4428] called[^h7121] for Jehoiada[^h3077] the chief[^h7218], and said[^h559] unto him, Why hast thou not required[^h1875] of the Levites[^h3881] to bring in[^h935] out of Judah[^h3063] and out of Jerusalem[^h3389] the collection[^h4864], according to the commandment of Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], and of the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], for the tabernacle[^h168] of witness[^h5715]?
###### 7
For the sons[^h1121] of Athaliah[^h6271], that wicked[^h4849] woman, had broken up[^h6555] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]; and also all the dedicated things[^h6944] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] did they bestow[^h6213] upon Baalim[^h1168].
###### 8
And at the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h559] they made[^h6213] a[^h259] chest[^h727], and set[^h5414] it without[^h2351] at the gate[^h8179] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And they made[^h5414] a proclamation[^h6963] through Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], to bring in[^h935] to the LORD[^h3068] the collection[^h4864] that Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of God[^h430] laid upon Israel[^h3478] in the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 10
And all the princes[^h8269] and all the people[^h5971] rejoiced[^h8055], and brought in[^h935], and cast[^h7993] into the chest[^h727], until they had made an end[^h3615].
###### 11
Now it came to pass, that at what time[^h6256] the chest[^h727] was brought[^h935] unto the king's[^h4428] office[^h6486] by the hand[^h3027] of the Levites[^h3881], and when they saw[^h7200] that there was much[^h7227] money[^h3701], the king's[^h4428] scribe[^h5608] and the high[^h7218] priest's[^h3548] officer[^h6496] came[^h935] and emptied[^h6168] the chest[^h727], and took[^h5375] it, and carried[^h7725] it to his place[^h4725] again[^h7725]. Thus they did[^h6213] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117], and gathered[^h622] money[^h3701] in abundance[^h7230].
###### 12
And the king[^h4428] and Jehoiada[^h3077] gave[^h5414] it to such as did[^h6213] the work[^h4399] of the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and hired[^h7936] masons[^h2672] and carpenters[^h2796] to repair[^h2318] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and also such as wrought[^h2796] iron[^h1270] and brass[^h5178] to mend[^h2388] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
So the workmen[^h4399] [^h6213] wrought[^h6213], and the work[^h4399] was[^h5927] perfected[^h724] by them[^h3027], and they set[^h5975] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] in his state[^h4971], and strengthened[^h553] it. 
###### 14
And when they had finished[^h3615] it, they brought[^h935] the rest[^h7605] of the money[^h3701] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] and Jehoiada[^h3077], whereof were made[^h6213] vessels[^h3627] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], even vessels[^h3627] to minister[^h8335], and to offer[^h5927] withal, and spoons[^h3709], and vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701]. And they offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] continually[^h8548] all the days[^h3117] of Jehoiada[^h3077]. 
###### 15
But Jehoiada[^h3077] waxed old[^h2204], and was full[^h7646] of days[^h3117] when he died[^h4191]; an hundred[^h3967] and thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was he when he died[^h4194].
###### 16
And they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] among the kings[^h4428], because he had done[^h6213] good[^h2896] in Israel[^h3478], both toward God[^h430], and toward his house[^h1004].
###### 17
Now after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Jehoiada[^h3077] came[^h935] the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063], and made obeisance[^h7812] to the king[^h4428]. Then the king[^h4428] hearkened[^h8085] unto them.
###### 18
And they left[^h5800] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], and served[^h5647] groves[^h842] and idols[^h6091]: and wrath[^h7110] came upon Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] for this their trespass[^h819].
###### 19
Yet he sent[^h7971] prophets[^h5030] to them, to bring them again[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and they testified[^h5749] against them: but they would not give ear[^h238].
###### 20
And the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] came[^h3847] upon Zechariah[^h2148] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548], which stood[^h5975] above the people[^h5971], and said[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] God[^h430], Why transgress[^h5674] ye the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068], that ye cannot prosper[^h6743]? because ye have forsaken[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], he hath also forsaken[^h5800] you. 
###### 21
And they conspired[^h7194] against him, and stoned[^h7275] him with stones[^h68] at the commandment[^h4687] of the king[^h4428] in the court[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
Thus Joash[^h3101] the king[^h4428] remembered[^h2142] not the kindness[^h2617] which Jehoiada[^h3077] his father[^h1] had done[^h6213] to him, but slew[^h2026] his son[^h1121]. And when he died[^h4194], he said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] look[^h7200] upon it, and require[^h1875] it.
###### 23
And it came to pass at the end[^h8622] of the year[^h8141], that the host[^h2428] of Syria[^h758] came up[^h5927] against him: and they came[^h935] to Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], and destroyed[^h7843] all the princes[^h8269] of the people[^h5971] from among the people[^h5971], and sent[^h7971] all the spoil[^h7998] of them unto the king[^h4428] of Damascus[^h1834].  
###### 24
For the army[^h2428] of the Syrians[^h758] came[^h935] with a small[^h4705] company of men[^h582], and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] a very[^h3966] great[^h7230] host[^h2428] into their hand[^h3027], because they had forsaken[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1]. So they executed[^h6213] judgment[^h8201] against Joash[^h3101].
###### 25
And when they were departed[^h3212] from him, (for they left[^h5800] him in great[^h7227] diseases[^h4251],) his own servants[^h5650] conspired[^h7194] against him for the blood[^h1818] of the sons[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548], and slew[^h2026] him on his bed[^h4296], and he died[^h4191]: and they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], but they buried[^h6912] him not in the sepulchres[^h6913] of the kings[^h4428].
###### 26
And these are they that conspired[^h7194] against him; Zabad[^h2066] the son[^h1121] of Shimeath[^h8100] an Ammonitess[^h5985], and Jehozabad[^h3075] the son[^h1121] of Shimrith[^h8116] a Moabitess[^h4125].  
###### 27
Now concerning his sons[^h1121], and the greatness[^h7235] [^h7230] of the burdens[^h4853] laid upon him, and the repairing[^h3247] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the story[^h4097] of the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428]. And Amaziah[^h558] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

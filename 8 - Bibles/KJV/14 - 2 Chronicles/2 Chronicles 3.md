###### 1
Then Solomon[^h8010] began[^h2490] to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] at Jerusalem[^h3389] in mount[^h2022] Moriah[^h4179], where the LORD appeared[^h7200] unto David[^h1732] his father[^h1], in the place[^h4725] that David[^h1732] had prepared[^h3559] in the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Ornan[^h771] the Jebusite[^h2983]. 
###### 2
And he began[^h2490] to build[^h1129] in the second[^h8145] day of the second[^h8145] month[^h2320], in the fourth[^h702] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4438].
###### 3
Now these are the things wherein Solomon[^h8010] was instructed[^h3245] for the building[^h1129] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]. The length[^h753] by cubits[^h520] after the first[^h7223] measure[^h4060] was threescore[^h8346] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]. 
###### 4
And the porch[^h197] that was in the front[^h6440] of the house, the length[^h753] of it was according to the breadth[^h7341] of the house[^h1004], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520], and the height[^h1363] was an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242]: and he overlaid[^h6823] it within[^h6441] with pure[^h2889] gold[^h2091].
###### 5
And the greater[^h1419] house[^h1004] he cieled[^h2645] with fir[^h1265] tree[^h6086], which he overlaid[^h2645] with fine[^h2896] gold[^h2091], and set[^h5927] thereon palm trees[^h8561] and chains[^h8333].
###### 6
And he garnished[^h6823] the house[^h1004] with precious[^h3368] stones[^h68] for beauty[^h8597]: and the gold[^h2091] was gold[^h2091] of Parvaim[^h6516]. 
###### 7
He overlaid[^h2645] also the house[^h1004], the beams[^h6982], the posts[^h5592], and the walls[^h7023] thereof, and the doors[^h1817] thereof, with gold[^h2091]; and graved[^h6605] cherubims[^h3742] on the walls[^h7023].
###### 8
And he made[^h6213] the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] house[^h1004], the length[^h753] whereof was according to[^h6440] the breadth[^h7341] of the house[^h1004], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] thereof twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]: and he overlaid[^h2645] it with fine[^h2896] gold[^h2091], amounting to six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603].
###### 9
And the weight[^h4948] of the nails[^h4548] was fifty[^h2572] shekels[^h8255] of gold[^h2091]. And he overlaid[^h2645] the upper chambers[^h5944] with gold[^h2091].
###### 10
And in the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] house[^h1004] he made[^h6213] two[^h8147] cherubims[^h3742] of image[^h6816] work[^h4639], and overlaid[^h6823] them with gold[^h2091]. 
###### 11
And the wings[^h3671] of the cherubims[^h3742] were twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] long[^h753]: one[^h259] wing[^h3671] of the one cherub was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520], reaching[^h5060] to the wall[^h7023] of the house[^h1004]: and the other[^h312] wing[^h3671] was likewise five[^h2568] cubits[^h520], reaching[^h5060] to the wing[^h3671] of the other[^h312] cherub[^h3742].
###### 12
And one wing[^h3671] of the other[^h259] cherub[^h3742] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520], reaching[^h5060] to the wall[^h7023] of the house[^h1004]: and the other[^h312] wing[^h3671] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] also, joining[^h1695] to the wing[^h3671] of the other[^h312] cherub[^h3742].
###### 13
The wings[^h3671] of these cherubims[^h3742] spread themselves forth[^h6566] twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]: and they stood[^h5975] on their feet[^h7272], and their faces[^h6440] were inward[^h1004]. 
###### 14
And he made[^h6213] the vail[^h6532] of blue[^h8504], and purple[^h713], and crimson[^h3758], and fine linen[^h948], and wrought[^h5927] cherubims[^h3742] thereon. 
###### 15
Also he made[^h6213] before[^h6440] the house[^h1004] two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982] of thirty[^h7970] and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] high[^h753], and the chapiter[^h6858] that was on the top[^h7218] of each of them was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520]. 
###### 16
And he made[^h6213] chains[^h8333], as in the oracle[^h1687], and put[^h5414] them on the heads[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982]; and made[^h6213] an hundred[^h3967] pomegranates[^h7416], and put[^h5414] them on the chains[^h8333].
###### 17
And he reared up[^h6965] the pillars[^h5982] before[^h6440] the temple[^h1964], one[^h259] on the right hand[^h3225], and the other[^h259] on the left[^h8040]; and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that on the right hand[^h3233] [^h3227] Jachin[^h3199], and the name[^h8034] of that on the left[^h8042] Boaz[^h1162].

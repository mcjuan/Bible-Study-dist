###### 1
In the six[^h8337] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of Asa[^h609] Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] came up[^h5927] against Judah[^h3063], and built[^h1129] Ramah[^h7414], to the intent that[^h1115] he might let[^h5414] none go out[^h3318] or come in[^h935] to Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 2
Then Asa[^h609] brought out[^h3318] silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091] out of the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] and of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and sent[^h7971] to Benhadad[^h1130] king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], that dwelt[^h3427] at Damascus[^h1834], saying[^h559], 
###### 3
There is a league[^h1285] between me and thee, as there was between my father[^h1] and thy father[^h1]: behold, I have sent[^h7971] thee silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091]; go[^h3212], break[^h6565] thy league[^h1285] with Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that he may depart[^h5927] from me.
###### 4
And Benhadad[^h1130] hearkened[^h8085] unto king[^h4428] Asa[^h609], and sent[^h7971] the captains[^h8269] of his armies[^h2428] against the cities[^h5892] of Israel[^h3478]; and they smote[^h5221] Ijon[^h5859], and Dan[^h1835], and Abelmaim[^h66], and all the store[^h4543] cities[^h5892] of Naphtali[^h5321]. 
###### 5
And it came to pass, when Baasha[^h1201] heard[^h8085] it, that he left off[^h2308] building[^h1129] of Ramah[^h7414], and let his work[^h4399] cease[^h7673].
###### 6
Then Asa[^h609] the king[^h4428] took[^h3947] all Judah[^h3063]; and they carried away[^h5375] the stones[^h68] of Ramah[^h7414], and the timber[^h6086] thereof, wherewith Baasha[^h1201] was building[^h1129]; and he built[^h1129] therewith Geba[^h1387] and Mizpah[^h4709].
###### 7
And at that time[^h6256] Hanani[^h2607] the seer[^h7200] came[^h935] to Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and said[^h559] unto him, Because thou hast relied[^h8172] on the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], and not relied[^h8172] on the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], therefore is the host[^h2428] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] escaped[^h4422] out of thine hand[^h3027].
###### 8
Were not the Ethiopians[^h3569] and the Lubims[^h3864] a huge[^h7230] host[^h2428], with very[^h3966] many[^h7235] chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571]? yet, because thou didst rely[^h8172] on the LORD[^h3068], he delivered[^h5414] them into thine hand[^h3027]. 
###### 9
For the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] run to and fro[^h7751] throughout the whole earth[^h776], to shew himself strong[^h2388] in the behalf of them whose heart[^h3824] is perfect[^h8003] toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly[^h5528]: therefore from henceforth[^h6258] thou shalt have[^h3426] wars[^h4421]. 
###### 10
Then Asa[^h609] was wroth[^h3707] with the seer[^h7200], and put[^h5414] him in a prison[^h4115] house[^h1004]; for he was in a rage[^h2197] with him because of this thing. And Asa[^h609] oppressed[^h7533] some of the people[^h5971] the same time[^h6256]. 
###### 11
And, behold, the acts[^h1697] of Asa[^h609], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], lo, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and Israel[^h3478].
###### 12
And Asa[^h609] in the thirty[^h7970] and ninth[^h8672] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4438] was diseased[^h2456] in his feet[^h7272], until his disease[^h2483] was exceeding[^h4605] great: yet in his disease[^h2483] he sought[^h1875] not to the LORD[^h3068], but to the physicians[^h7495].
###### 13
And Asa[^h609] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and died[^h4191] in the one[^h259] and fortieth[^h705] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427].
###### 14
And they buried[^h6912] him in his own sepulchres[^h6913], which he had made[^h3738] for himself in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], and laid[^h7901] him in the bed[^h4904] which was filled[^h4390] with sweet odours[^h1314] and divers kinds[^h2177] of spices prepared[^h7543] by the apothecaries'[^h4842] art[^h4639]: and they made[^h8313] a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] burning[^h8316] for him.

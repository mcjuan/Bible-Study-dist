###### 1
Amaziah[^h558] was twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] twenty[^h6242] and nine[^h8672] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Jehoaddan[^h3086] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], but not with a perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3824].
###### 3
Now it came to pass, when the kingdom[^h4467] was established[^h2388] to him, that he slew[^h2026] his servants[^h5650] that had killed[^h5221] the king[^h4428] his father[^h1]. 
###### 4
But he slew[^h4191] not their children[^h1121], but did as it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] in the book[^h5612] of Moses[^h4872], where the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680], saying[^h559], The fathers[^h1] shall not die[^h4191] for the children[^h1121], neither shall the children[^h1121] die[^h4191] for the fathers[^h1], but every man[^h376] shall die[^h4191] for his own sin[^h2399].
###### 5
Moreover Amaziah[^h558] gathered[^h6908] Judah[^h3063] together[^h6908], and made[^h5975] them captains[^h8269] over thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967], according to the houses[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1], throughout all Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144]: and he numbered[^h6485] them from twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and above[^h4605], and found[^h4672] them three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] choice[^h977] men, able to go forth[^h3318] to war[^h6635], that could handle[^h270] spear[^h7420] and shield[^h6793].
###### 6
He hired[^h7936] also an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] mighty[^h1368] men of valour[^h2428] out of Israel[^h3478] for an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701].
###### 7
But there came[^h935] a man[^h376] of God[^h430] to him, saying[^h559], O king[^h4428], let not the army[^h6635] of Israel[^h3478] go[^h935] with thee; for the LORD[^h3068] is not with Israel[^h3478], to wit, with all the children[^h1121] of Ephraim[^h669].
###### 8
But if thou wilt go[^h935], do[^h6213] it, be strong[^h2388] for the battle[^h4421]: God[^h430] shall make thee fall[^h3782] before[^h6440] the enemy[^h341]: for God[^h430] hath[^h3426] power[^h3581] to help[^h5826], and to cast down[^h3782].
###### 9
And Amaziah[^h558] said[^h559] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430], But what shall we do[^h6213] for the hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603] which I have given[^h5414] to the army[^h1416] of Israel[^h3478]? And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] answered[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] is[^h3426] able to give[^h5414] thee much more[^h7235] than this. 
###### 10
Then Amaziah[^h558] separated[^h914] them, to wit, the army[^h1416] that was come[^h935] to him out of Ephraim[^h669], to go[^h3212] home[^h4725] again[^h3212]: wherefore their anger[^h639] was greatly[^h3966] kindled[^h2734] against Judah[^h3063], and they returned[^h7725] home[^h4725] in great[^h2750] anger[^h639].  
###### 11
And Amaziah[^h558] strengthened[^h2388] himself, and led forth[^h5090] his people[^h5971], and went[^h3212] to the valley[^h1516] of salt[^h4417], and smote[^h5221] of the children[^h1121] of Seir[^h8165] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505].
###### 12
And other ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] left alive[^h2416] did the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] carry away captive[^h7617], and brought[^h935] them unto the top[^h7218] of the rock[^h5553], and cast them down[^h7993] from the top[^h7218] of the rock[^h5553], that they all were broken in pieces[^h1234].
###### 13
But the soldiers[^h1121] of the army[^h1416] which Amaziah[^h558] sent back[^h7725], that they should not go[^h3212] with him to battle[^h4421], fell[^h6584] upon the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], from Samaria[^h8111] even unto Bethhoron[^h1032], and smote[^h5221] three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] of them, and took[^h962] much[^h7227] spoil[^h961]. 
###### 14
Now it came to pass, after[^h310] that Amaziah[^h558] was come[^h935] from the slaughter[^h5221] of the Edomites[^h130], that he brought[^h935] the gods[^h430] of the children[^h1121] of Seir[^h8165], and set them up[^h5975] to be his gods[^h430], and bowed down[^h7812] himself before[^h6440] them, and burned incense[^h6999] unto them.
###### 15
Wherefore the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Amaziah[^h558], and he sent[^h7971] unto him a prophet[^h5030], which said[^h559] unto him, Why hast thou sought[^h1875] after the gods[^h430] of the people[^h5971], which could not deliver[^h5337] their own people[^h5971] out of thine hand[^h3027]?
###### 16
And it came to pass, as he talked[^h1696] with him, that the king said[^h559] unto him, Art thou made[^h5414] of the king's[^h4428] counsel[^h3289]? forbear[^h2308]; why shouldest thou be smitten[^h5221]? Then the prophet[^h5030] forbare[^h2308], and said[^h559], I know[^h3045] that God[^h430] hath determined[^h3289] to destroy[^h7843] thee, because thou hast done[^h6213] this, and hast not hearkened[^h8085] unto my counsel[^h6098]. 
###### 17
Then Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] took advice[^h3289], and sent[^h7971] to Joash[^h3101], the son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059], the son[^h1121] of Jehu[^h3058], king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Come[^h3212], let us see one another[^h7200] in the face[^h6440].
###### 18
And Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] to Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], The thistle[^h2336] that was in Lebanon[^h3844] sent[^h7971] to the cedar[^h730] that was in Lebanon[^h3844], saying[^h559], Give[^h5414] thy daughter[^h1323] to my son[^h1121] to wife[^h802]: and there passed by[^h5674] a wild[^h7704] beast[^h2416] that was in Lebanon[^h3844], and trode down[^h7429] the thistle[^h2336].  
###### 19
Thou sayest[^h559], Lo, thou hast smitten[^h5221] the Edomites[^h123]; and thine heart[^h3820] lifteth thee up[^h5375] to boast[^h3513]: abide[^h3427] now at home[^h1004]; why shouldest thou meddle[^h1624] to thine hurt[^h7451], that thou shouldest fall[^h5307], even thou, and Judah[^h3063] with thee?
###### 20
But Amaziah[^h558] would not hear[^h8085]; for it came of God[^h430], that he might deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies, because they sought[^h1875] after the gods[^h430] of Edom[^h123].
###### 21
So Joash[^h3101] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927]; and they saw one another[^h7200] in the face[^h6440], both he and Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], at Bethshemesh[^h1053], which belongeth to Judah[^h3063].
###### 22
And Judah[^h3063] was put to the worse[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], and they fled[^h5127] every man[^h376] to his tent[^h168]. 
###### 23
And Joash[^h3101] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] took[^h8610] Amaziah[^h558] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101], the son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059], at Bethshemesh[^h1053], and brought[^h935] him to Jerusalem[^h3389], and brake down[^h6555] the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] from the gate[^h8179] of Ephraim[^h669] to the corner[^h6437] gate[^h8179], four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520]. 
###### 24
And he took all the gold[^h2091] and the silver[^h3701], and all the vessels[^h3627] that were found[^h4672] in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] with Obededom[^h5654], and the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], the hostages[^h1121] [^h8594] also, and returned[^h7725] to Samaria[^h8111].
###### 25
And Amaziah[^h558] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] lived[^h2421] after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Joash[^h3101] son[^h1121] of Jehoahaz[^h3059] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] years[^h8141].
###### 26
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Amaziah[^h558], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], behold, are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and Israel[^h3478]?
###### 27
Now after the time[^h6256] that Amaziah[^h558] did turn away[^h5493] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] they made[^h7194] a conspiracy[^h7195] against him in Jerusalem[^h3389]; and he fled[^h5127] to Lachish[^h3923]: but they sent[^h7971] to Lachish[^h3923] after[^h310] him, and slew[^h4191] him there.  
###### 28
And they brought[^h5375] him upon horses[^h5483], and buried[^h6912] him with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063].

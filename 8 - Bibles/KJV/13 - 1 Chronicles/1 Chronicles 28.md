###### 1
And David[^h1732] assembled[^h6950] all the princes[^h8269] of Israel[^h3478], the princes[^h8269] of the tribes[^h7626], and the captains[^h8269] of the companies[^h4256] that ministered[^h8334] to the king[^h4428] by course[^h4256], and the captains[^h8269] over the thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] over the hundreds[^h3967], and the stewards[^h8269] over all the substance[^h7399] and possession[^h4735] of the king[^h4428], and of his sons[^h1121], with the officers[^h5631], and with the mighty men[^h1368], and with all the valiant men[^h2428], unto Jerusalem[^h3389].   
###### 2
Then David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] stood up[^h6965] upon his feet[^h7272], and said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] me, my brethren[^h251], and my people[^h5971]: As for me, I had in mine heart[^h3824] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] of rest[^h4496] for the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the footstool[^h1916] [^h7272] of our God[^h430], and had made ready[^h3559] for the building[^h1129]:
###### 3
But God[^h430] said[^h559] unto me, Thou shalt not build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for my name[^h8034], because thou hast been a man[^h376] of war[^h4421], and hast shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]. 
###### 4
Howbeit the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] chose[^h977] me before all the house[^h1004] of my father[^h1] to be king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769]: for he hath chosen[^h977] Judah[^h3063] to be the ruler[^h5057]; and of the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], the house[^h1004] of my father[^h1]; and among the sons[^h1121] of my father[^h1] he liked[^h7521] me to make me king[^h4427] over all Israel[^h3478]:
###### 5
And of all my sons[^h1121], (for the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] me many[^h7227] sons[^h1121],) he hath chosen[^h977] Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121] to sit[^h3427] upon the throne[^h3678] of the kingdom[^h4438] of the LORD[^h3068] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto me, Solomon[^h8010] thy son[^h1121], he shall build[^h1129] my house[^h1004] and my courts[^h2691]: for I have chosen[^h977] him to be my son[^h1121], and I will be his father[^h1].
###### 7
Moreover I will establish[^h3559] his kingdom[^h4438] for ever[^h5769], if he be constant[^h2388] to do[^h6213] my commandments[^h4687] and my judgments[^h4941], as at this day[^h3117]. 
###### 8
Now therefore in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478] the congregation[^h6951] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the audience[^h241] of our God[^h430], keep[^h8104] and seek[^h1875] for all the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]: that ye may possess[^h3423] this good[^h2896] land[^h776], and leave it for an inheritance[^h5157] for your children[^h1121] after[^h310] you for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 9
And thou, Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121], know[^h3045] thou the God[^h430] of thy father[^h1], and serve[^h5647] him with a perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3820] and with a willing[^h2655] mind[^h5315]: for the LORD[^h3068] searcheth[^h1875] all hearts[^h3824], and understandeth[^h995] all the imaginations[^h3336] of the thoughts[^h4284]: if thou seek[^h1875] him, he will be found[^h4672] of thee; but if thou forsake[^h5800] him, he will cast thee off[^h2186] for ever[^h5703].
###### 10
Take heed[^h7200] now; for the LORD[^h3068] hath chosen[^h977] thee to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the sanctuary[^h4720]: be strong[^h2388], and do[^h6213] it.
###### 11
Then David[^h1732] gave[^h5414] to Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121] the pattern[^h8403] of the porch[^h197], and of the houses[^h1004] thereof, and of the treasuries[^h1597] thereof, and of the upper chambers[^h5944] thereof, and of the inner[^h6442] parlours[^h2315] thereof, and of the place[^h1004] of the mercy seat[^h3727],
###### 12
And the pattern[^h8403] of all that he had by the spirit[^h7307], of the courts[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and of all the chambers[^h3957] round about[^h5439], of the treasuries[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and of the treasuries[^h214] of the dedicated things[^h6944]: 
###### 13
Also for the courses[^h4256] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and for all the work[^h4399] of the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and for all the vessels[^h3627] of service[^h5656] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
He gave of gold[^h2091] by weight[^h4948] for things of gold[^h2091], for all instruments[^h3627] of all manner of service[^h5656]; silver also for all instruments[^h3627] of silver[^h3701] by weight[^h4948], for all instruments[^h3627] of every kind of service[^h5656]:
###### 15
Even the weight[^h4948] for the candlesticks[^h4501] of gold[^h2091], and for their lamps[^h5216] of gold[^h2091], by weight[^h4948] for every candlestick[^h4501], and for the lamps[^h5216] thereof: and for the candlesticks[^h4501] of silver[^h3701] by weight[^h4948], both for the candlestick[^h4501], and also for the lamps[^h5216] thereof, according to the use[^h5656] of every candlestick[^h4501].
###### 16
And by weight[^h4948] he gave gold[^h2091] for the tables[^h7979] of shewbread[^h4635], for every table[^h7979]; and likewise silver[^h3701] for the tables[^h7979] of silver[^h3701]:
###### 17
Also pure[^h2889] gold[^h2091] for the fleshhooks[^h4207], and the bowls[^h4219], and the cups[^h7184]: and for the golden[^h2091] basons[^h3713] he gave gold by weight[^h4948] for every bason[^h3713]; and likewise silver by weight[^h4948] for every bason[^h3713] of silver[^h3701]:
###### 18
And for the altar[^h4196] of incense[^h7004] refined[^h2212] gold[^h2091] by weight[^h4948]; and gold[^h2091] for the pattern[^h8403] of the chariot[^h4818] of the cherubims[^h3742], that spread out[^h6566] their wings, and covered[^h5526] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
All this, said David, the LORD[^h3068] made me understand[^h7919] in writing[^h3791] by his hand[^h3027] upon me, even all the works[^h4399] of this pattern[^h8403].
###### 20
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], Be strong[^h2388] and of good courage[^h553], and do[^h6213] it: fear[^h3372] not, nor be dismayed[^h2865]: for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], even my God[^h430], will be with thee; he will not fail[^h7503] thee, nor forsake[^h5800] thee, until thou hast finished[^h3615] all the work[^h4399] for the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
And, behold, the courses[^h4256] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], even they shall be with thee for all the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship[^h4399] every willing[^h5081] skilful man[^h2451], for any manner of service[^h5656]: also the princes[^h8269] and all the people[^h5971] will be wholly at thy commandment[^h1697].

###### 1
And David[^h1732] consulted[^h3289] with the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505] and hundreds[^h3967], and with every leader[^h5057].
###### 2
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], If it seem good[^h2895] unto you, and that it be of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], let us send[^h7971] abroad[^h6555] unto our brethren[^h251] every where, that are left[^h7604] in all the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478], and with them also to the priests[^h3548] and Levites[^h3881] which are in their cities[^h5892] and suburbs[^h4054], that they may gather[^h6908] themselves unto us:  
###### 3
And let us bring again[^h5437] the ark[^h727] of our God[^h430] to us: for we enquired[^h1875] not at it in the days[^h3117] of Saul[^h7586]. 
###### 4
And all the congregation[^h6951] said[^h559] that they would do so[^h6213]: for the thing[^h1697] was right[^h3474] in the eyes[^h5869] of all the people[^h5971].
###### 5
So David[^h1732] gathered[^h6950] all Israel[^h3478] together[^h6950], from Shihor[^h7883] of Egypt[^h4714] even unto the entering[^h935] of Hemath[^h2574], to bring[^h935] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] from Kirjathjearim[^h7157].
###### 6
And David[^h1732] went up[^h5927], and all Israel[^h3478], to Baalah[^h1173], that is, to Kirjathjearim[^h7157], which belonged to Judah[^h3063], to bring up[^h5927] thence the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] the LORD[^h3068], that dwelleth[^h3427] between the cherubims[^h3742], whose name[^h8034] is called[^h7121] on it.
###### 7
And they carried[^h7392] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] in a new[^h2319] cart[^h5699] out of the house[^h1004] of Abinadab[^h41]: and Uzza[^h5798] and Ahio[^h283] drave[^h5090] the cart[^h5699]. 
###### 8
And David[^h1732] and all Israel[^h3478] played[^h7832] before[^h6440] God[^h430] with all their might[^h5797], and with singing[^h7892], and with harps[^h3658], and with psalteries[^h5035], and with timbrels[^h8596], and with cymbals[^h4700], and with trumpets[^h2689]. 
###### 9
And when they came[^h935] unto the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Chidon[^h3592], Uzza[^h5798] put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] to hold[^h270] the ark[^h727]; for the oxen[^h1241] stumbled[^h8058].  
###### 10
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Uzza[^h5798], and he smote[^h5221] him, because he put[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] to the ark[^h727]: and there he died[^h4191] before[^h6440] God[^h430].
###### 11
And David[^h1732] was displeased[^h2734], because the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h6555] a breach[^h6556] upon Uzza[^h5798]: wherefore that place[^h4725] is called[^h7121] Perezuzza[^h6560] to this day[^h3117]. 
###### 12
And David[^h1732] was afraid[^h3372] of God[^h430] that day[^h3117], saying[^h559], How[^h1963] shall I bring[^h935] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] home to me?
###### 13
So David[^h1732] brought[^h5493] not the ark[^h727] home to himself to the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], but carried it aside[^h5186] into the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654] the Gittite[^h1663]. 
###### 14
And the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] remained[^h3427] with the family[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654] in his house[^h1004] three[^h7969] months[^h2320]. And the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654], and all that he had.

###### 1
So when David[^h1732] was old[^h2204] and full[^h7646] of days[^h3117], he made Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121] king[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And he gathered together[^h622] all the princes[^h8269] of Israel[^h3478], with the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881].
###### 3
Now the Levites[^h3881] were numbered[^h5608] from the age[^h1121] of thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141] and upward[^h4605]: and their number[^h4557] by their polls[^h1538], man by man[^h1397], was thirty[^h7970] and eight[^h8083] thousand[^h505].
###### 4
Of which[^h428], twenty[^h6242] and four[^h702] thousand[^h505] were to set forward[^h5329] the work[^h4399] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; and six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] were officers[^h7860] and judges[^h8199]: 
###### 5
Moreover four[^h702] thousand[^h505] were porters[^h7778]; and four[^h702] thousand[^h505] praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068] with the instruments[^h3627] which I made[^h6213], said David, to praise[^h1984] therewith.
###### 6
And David[^h1732] divided[^h2505] them into courses[^h4256] among the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], namely, Gershon[^h1648], Kohath[^h6955], and Merari[^h4847]. 
###### 7
Of the Gershonites[^h1649] were, Laadan[^h3936], and Shimei[^h8096]. 
###### 8
The sons[^h1121] of Laadan[^h3936]; the chief[^h7218] was Jehiel[^h3171], and Zetham[^h2241], and Joel[^h3100], three[^h7969].
###### 9
The sons[^h1121] of Shimei[^h8096]; Shelomith[^h8019] [^h8013], and Haziel[^h2381], and Haran[^h2039], three[^h7969]. These were the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of Laadan[^h3936].
###### 10
And the sons[^h1121] of Shimei[^h8096] were, Jahath[^h3189], Zina[^h2126], and Jeush[^h3266], and Beriah[^h1283]. These four[^h702] were the sons[^h1121] of Shimei[^h8096]. 
###### 11
And Jahath[^h3189] was the chief[^h7218], and Zizah[^h2125] the second[^h8145]: but Jeush[^h3266] and Beriah[^h1283] had not many[^h7235] sons[^h1121]; therefore they were in one[^h259] reckoning[^h6486], according to their father's[^h1] house[^h1004]. 
###### 12
The sons[^h1121] of Kohath[^h6955]; Amram[^h6019], Izhar[^h3324], Hebron[^h2275], and Uzziel[^h5816], four[^h702].
###### 13
The sons[^h1121] of Amram[^h6019]; Aaron[^h175] and Moses[^h4872]: and Aaron[^h175] was separated[^h914], that he should sanctify[^h6942] the most[^h6944] holy things[^h6944], he and his sons[^h1121] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], to burn incense[^h6999] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to minister[^h8334] unto him, and to bless[^h1288] in his name[^h8034] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 14
Now concerning Moses[^h4872] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], his sons[^h1121] were named[^h7121] of the tribe[^h7626] of Levi[^h3878].
###### 15
The sons[^h1121] of Moses[^h4872] were, Gershom[^h1647], and Eliezer[^h461].
###### 16
Of the sons[^h1121] of Gershom[^h1647], Shebuel[^h7619] was the chief[^h7218]. 
###### 17
And the sons[^h1121] of Eliezer[^h461] were, Rehabiah[^h7345] the chief[^h7218]. And Eliezer[^h461] had none other[^h312] sons[^h1121]; but the sons[^h1121] of Rehabiah[^h7345] were very[^h4605] many[^h7235].  
###### 18
Of the sons[^h1121] of Izhar[^h3324]; Shelomith[^h8019] the chief[^h7218].
###### 19
Of the sons[^h1121] of Hebron[^h2275]; Jeriah[^h3404] the first[^h7218], Amariah[^h568] the second[^h8145], Jahaziel[^h3166] the third[^h7992], and Jekameam[^h3360] the fourth[^h7243].
###### 20
Of the sons[^h1121] of Uzziel[^h5816]; Michah[^h4318] the first[^h7218], and Jesiah[^h3449] the second[^h8145].
###### 21
The sons[^h1121] of Merari[^h4847]; Mahli[^h4249], and Mushi[^h4187]. The sons[^h1121] of Mahli[^h4249]; Eleazar[^h499], and Kish[^h7027].
###### 22
And Eleazar[^h499] died[^h4191], and had no sons[^h1121], but daughters[^h1323]: and their brethren[^h251] the sons[^h1121] of Kish[^h7027] took[^h5375] them. 
###### 23
The sons[^h1121] of Mushi[^h4187]; Mahli[^h4249], and Eder[^h5740], and Jeremoth[^h3406], three[^h7969].
###### 24
These were the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] after the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1]; even the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1], as they were counted[^h6485] by number[^h4557] of names[^h8034] by their polls[^h1538], that did[^h6213] the work[^h4399] for the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], from the age[^h1121] of twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] and upward[^h4605].
###### 25
For David[^h1732] said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] hath given rest[^h5117] unto his people[^h5971], that they may dwell[^h7931] in Jerusalem[^h3389] for ever[^h5769]: 
###### 26
And also unto the Levites[^h3881]; they shall no more carry[^h5375] the tabernacle[^h4908], nor any vessels[^h3627] of it for the service[^h5656] thereof.
###### 27
For by the last[^h314] words[^h1697] of David[^h1732] the Levites[^h3881] were numbered[^h4557] from twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and above[^h4605]: 
###### 28
Because their office[^h4612] was to wait[^h3027] on the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] for the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], in the courts[^h2691], and in the chambers[^h3957], and in the purifying[^h2893] of all holy things[^h6944], and the work[^h4639] of the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]; 
###### 29
Both for the shewbread[^h3899] [^h4635], and for the fine flour[^h5560] for meat offering[^h4503], and for the unleavened[^h4682] cakes[^h7550], and for that which is baked in the pan[^h4227], and for that which is fried[^h7246], and for all manner of measure[^h4884] and size[^h4060]; 
###### 30
And to stand[^h5975] every morning[^h1242] to thank[^h3034] and praise[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068], and likewise at even[^h6153];
###### 31
And to offer[^h5927] all burnt sacrifices[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068] in the sabbaths[^h7676], in the new moons[^h2320], and on the set feasts[^h4150], by number[^h4557], according to the order[^h4941] commanded unto them, continually[^h8548] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 32
And that they should keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and the charge[^h4931] of the holy[^h6944] place, and the charge[^h4931] of the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] their brethren[^h251], in the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].

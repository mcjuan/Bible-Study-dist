###### 1
Now it came to pass, as David[^h1732] sat[^h3427] in his house[^h1004], that David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], Lo, I dwell[^h3427] in an house[^h1004] of cedars[^h730], but the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] remaineth under curtains[^h3407].
###### 2
Then Nathan[^h5416] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Do[^h6213] all that is in thine heart[^h3824]; for God[^h430] is with thee.
###### 3
And it came to pass the same night[^h3915], that the word[^h1697] of God[^h430] came to Nathan[^h5416], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Go[^h3212] and tell[^h559] David[^h1732] my servant[^h5650], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Thou shalt not build[^h1129] me an house[^h1004] to dwell in[^h3427]:
###### 5
For I have not dwelt in[^h3427] an house[^h1004] since the day[^h3117] that I brought up[^h5927] Israel[^h3478] unto this day[^h3117]; but have gone from tent[^h168] to tent[^h168], and from one tabernacle[^h4908] to another. 
###### 6
Wheresoever I have walked[^h1980] with all Israel[^h3478], spake[^h1696] I a word[^h1697] to any[^h259] of the judges[^h8199] of Israel[^h3478], whom I commanded[^h6680] to feed[^h7462] my people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Why have ye not built[^h1129] me an house[^h1004] of cedars[^h730]?
###### 7
Now therefore thus shalt thou say[^h559] unto my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], I took[^h3947] thee from the sheepcote[^h5116], even from following[^h310] the sheep[^h6629], that thou shouldest be ruler[^h5057] over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]: 
###### 8
And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked[^h1980], and have cut off[^h3772] all thine enemies[^h341] from before[^h6440] thee, and have made[^h6213] thee a name[^h8034] like the name[^h8034] of the great men[^h1419] that are in the earth[^h776].
###### 9
Also I will ordain[^h7760] a place[^h4725] for my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and will plant[^h5193] them, and they shall dwell[^h7931] in their place, and shall be moved[^h7264] no more; neither shall the children[^h1121] of wickedness[^h5766] waste[^h1086] them any more[^h3254], as at the beginning[^h7223],
###### 10
And since the time[^h3117] that I commanded[^h6680] judges[^h8199] to be over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]. Moreover I will subdue[^h3665] all thine enemies[^h341]. Furthermore I tell[^h5046] thee that the LORD[^h3068] will build[^h1129] thee an house[^h1004].
###### 11
And it shall come to pass, when thy days[^h3117] be expired[^h4390] that thou must go[^h3212] to be with thy fathers[^h1], that I will raise up[^h6965] thy seed[^h2233] after[^h310] thee, which shall be of thy sons[^h1121]; and I will establish[^h3559] his kingdom[^h4438].
###### 12
He shall build[^h1129] me an house[^h1004], and I will stablish[^h3559] his throne[^h3678] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 13
I will be his father[^h1], and he shall be my son[^h1121]: and I will not take[^h5493] my mercy[^h2617] away[^h5493] from him, as I took[^h5493] it from him that was before[^h6440] thee:
###### 14
But I will settle[^h5975] him in mine house[^h1004] and in my kingdom[^h4438] for ever[^h5769]: and his throne[^h3678] shall be established[^h3559] for[^h5704] evermore[^h5769].
###### 15
According to all these words[^h1697], and according to all this vision[^h2377], so did Nathan[^h5416] speak[^h1696] unto David[^h1732].
###### 16
And David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] came[^h935] and sat[^h3427] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Who am I, O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], and what is mine house[^h1004], that thou hast brought[^h935] me hitherto[^h1988]?
###### 17
And yet this was a small thing[^h6994] in thine eyes[^h5869], O God[^h430]; for thou hast also spoken[^h1696] of thy servant's[^h5650] house[^h1004] for a great while to come[^h7350], and hast regarded[^h7200] me according to the estate[^h8448] of a man[^h120] of high degree[^h4609], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430].
###### 18
What can[^h3254] David[^h1732] speak more[^h3254] to thee for the honour[^h3519] of thy servant[^h5650]? for thou knowest[^h3045] thy servant[^h5650].
###### 19
O LORD[^h3068], for thy servant's[^h5650] sake, and according to thine own heart[^h3820], hast thou done[^h6213] all this greatness[^h1420], in making known[^h3045] all these great things[^h1420]. 
###### 20
O LORD[^h3068], there is none like thee, neither is there any God[^h430] beside[^h2108] thee, according to all that we have heard[^h8085] with our ears[^h241].
###### 21
And what one[^h259] nation[^h1471] in the earth[^h776] is like thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], whom God[^h430] went[^h1980] to redeem[^h6299] to be his own people[^h5971], to make[^h7760] thee a name[^h8034] of greatness[^h1420] and terribleness[^h3372], by driving out[^h1644] nations[^h1471] from before[^h6440] thy people[^h5971], whom thou hast redeemed[^h6299] out of Egypt[^h4714]?
###### 22
For thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] didst thou make[^h5414] thine own people[^h5971] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]; and thou, LORD[^h3068], becamest their God[^h430].
###### 23
Therefore now, LORD[^h3068], let the thing[^h1697] that thou hast spoken[^h1696] concerning thy servant[^h5650] and concerning his house[^h1004] be established[^h539] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], and do[^h6213] as thou hast said[^h1696].
###### 24
Let it even be established[^h539], that thy name[^h8034] may be magnified[^h1431] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], even a God[^h430] to Israel[^h3478]: and let the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] thy servant[^h5650] be established[^h3559] before[^h6440] thee.
###### 25
For thou, O my God[^h430], hast told[^h1540] [^h241] thy servant[^h5650] that thou wilt build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004]: therefore thy servant[^h5650] hath found[^h4672] in his heart to pray[^h6419] before[^h6440] thee. 
###### 26
And now, LORD[^h3068], thou art God[^h430], and hast promised[^h1696] this goodness[^h2896] unto thy servant[^h5650]:
###### 27
Now therefore let it please[^h2974] thee to bless[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of thy servant[^h5650], that it may be before[^h6440] thee for ever[^h5769]: for thou blessest[^h1288], O LORD[^h3068], and it shall be blessed[^h1288] for ever[^h5769].

###### 1
Now the sons[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] the firstborn[^h1060] of Israel[^h3478], (for he was the firstborn[^h1060]; but, forasmuch as he defiled[^h2490] his father's[^h1] bed[^h3326], his birthright[^h1062] was given[^h5414] unto the sons[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] the son[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned[^h3187] after the birthright[^h1062].
###### 2
For Judah[^h3063] prevailed[^h1396] above his brethren[^h251], and of him came the chief ruler[^h5057]; but the birthright[^h1062] was Joseph's[^h3130]:) 
###### 3
The sons[^h1121], I say, of Reuben[^h7205] the firstborn[^h1060] of Israel[^h3478] were, Hanoch[^h2585], and Pallu[^h6396], Hezron[^h2696], and Carmi[^h3756].
###### 4
The sons[^h1121] of Joel[^h3100]; Shemaiah[^h8098] his son[^h1121], Gog[^h1463] his son[^h1121], Shimei[^h8096] his son[^h1121],
###### 5
Micah[^h4318] his son[^h1121], Reaia[^h7211] his son[^h1121], Baal[^h1168] his son[^h1121],
###### 6
Beerah[^h880] his son[^h1121], whom Tilgathpilneser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] carried away[^h1540] captive: he was prince[^h5387] of the Reubenites[^h7206]. 
###### 7
And his brethren[^h251] by their families[^h4940], when the genealogy[^h3187] of their generations[^h8435] was reckoned[^h3187], were the chief[^h7218], Jeiel[^h3273], and Zechariah[^h2148],
###### 8
And Bela[^h1106] the son[^h1121] of Azaz[^h5811], the son[^h1121] of Shema[^h8087], the son[^h1121] of Joel[^h3100], who dwelt[^h3427] in Aroer[^h6177], even unto Nebo[^h5015] and Baalmeon[^h1186]: 
###### 9
And eastward[^h4217] he inhabited[^h3427] unto the entering[^h935] in of the wilderness[^h4057] from the river[^h5104] Euphrates[^h6578]: because their cattle[^h4735] were multiplied[^h7235] in the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 10
And in the days[^h3117] of Saul[^h7586] they made[^h6213] war[^h4421] with the Hagarites[^h1905], who fell[^h5307] by their hand[^h3027]: and they dwelt[^h3427] in their tents[^h168] throughout[^h6440] all the east[^h4217] land of Gilead[^h1568]. 
###### 11
And the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] dwelt[^h3427] over against them, in the land[^h776] of Bashan[^h1316] unto Salchah[^h5548]:
###### 12
Joel[^h3100] the chief[^h7218], and Shapham[^h8223] the next[^h4932], and Jaanai[^h3285], and Shaphat[^h8202] in Bashan[^h1316].
###### 13
And their brethren[^h251] of the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1] were, Michael[^h4317], and Meshullam[^h4918], and Sheba[^h7652], and Jorai[^h3140], and Jachan[^h3275], and Zia[^h2127], and Heber[^h5677], seven[^h7651].
###### 14
These are the children[^h1121] of Abihail[^h32] the son[^h1121] of Huri[^h2359], the son[^h1121] of Jaroah[^h3386], the son[^h1121] of Gilead[^h1568], the son[^h1121] of Michael[^h4317], the son[^h1121] of Jeshishai[^h3454], the son[^h1121] of Jahdo[^h3163], the son[^h1121] of Buz[^h938];
###### 15
Ahi[^h277] the son[^h1121] of Abdiel[^h5661], the son[^h1121] of Guni[^h1476], chief[^h7218] of the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1].
###### 16
And they dwelt[^h3427] in Gilead[^h1568] in Bashan[^h1316], and in her towns[^h1323], and in all the suburbs[^h4054] of Sharon[^h8289], upon their borders[^h8444]. 
###### 17
All these were reckoned by genealogies[^h3187] in the days[^h3117] of Jotham[^h3147] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and in the days[^h3117] of Jeroboam[^h3379] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
The sons[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and the Gadites[^h1425], and half[^h2677] the tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], of valiant men[^h2428], men[^h582] able to bear[^h5375] buckler[^h4043] and sword[^h2719], and to shoot[^h1869] with bow[^h7198], and skilful[^h3925] in war[^h4421], were four[^h702] and forty[^h705] thousand[^h505] seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] and threescore[^h8346], that went out[^h3318] to the war[^h6635]. 
###### 19
And they made[^h6213] war[^h4421] with the Hagarites[^h1905], with Jetur[^h3195], and Nephish[^h5305], and Nodab[^h5114].
###### 20
And they were helped[^h5826] against them, and the Hagarites[^h1905] were delivered[^h5414] into their hand[^h3027], and all that were with them: for they cried[^h2199] to God[^h430] in the battle[^h4421], and he was intreated[^h6279] of them; because they put their trust[^h982] in him.
###### 21
And they took away[^h7617] their cattle[^h4735]; of their camels[^h1581] fifty[^h2572] thousand[^h505], and of sheep[^h6629] two hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] thousand[^h505], and of asses[^h2543] two thousand[^h505], and of men[^h120] [^h5315] an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505].  
###### 22
For there fell[^h5307] down many[^h7227] slain[^h2491], because the war[^h4421] was of God[^h430]. And they dwelt[^h3427] in their steads until the captivity[^h1473].
###### 23
And the children[^h1121] of the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776]: they increased[^h7235] from Bashan[^h1316] unto Baalhermon[^h1179] and Senir[^h8149], and unto mount[^h2022] Hermon[^h2768].
###### 24
And these were the heads[^h7218] of the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1], even Epher[^h6081], and Ishi[^h3469], and Eliel[^h447], and Azriel[^h5837], and Jeremiah[^h3414], and Hodaviah[^h1938], and Jahdiel[^h3164], mighty[^h1368] men[^h582] of valour[^h2428], famous[^h8034] men[^h582], and heads[^h7218] of the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 25
And they transgressed[^h4603] against the God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], and went a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] the gods[^h430] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], whom God[^h430] destroyed[^h8045] before[^h6440] them.
###### 26
And the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] stirred up[^h5782] the spirit[^h7307] of Pul[^h6322] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and the spirit[^h7307] of Tilgathpilneser[^h8407] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and he carried them away[^h1540], even the Reubenites[^h7206], and the Gadites[^h1425], and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], and brought[^h935] them unto Halah[^h2477], and Habor[^h2249], and Hara[^h2024], and to the river[^h5104] Gozan[^h1470], unto this day[^h3117].

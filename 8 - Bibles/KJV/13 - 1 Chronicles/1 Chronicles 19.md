###### 1
Now it came to pass after this[^h310], that Nahash[^h5176] the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] died[^h4191], and his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 2
And David[^h1732] said[^h559], I will shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto Hanun[^h2586] the son[^h1121] of Nahash[^h5176], because his father[^h1] shewed[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] to me. And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to comfort[^h5162] him concerning his father[^h1]. So the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732] came[^h935] into the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] to Hanun[^h2586], to comfort[^h5162] him.
###### 3
But the princes[^h8269] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] said[^h559] to Hanun[^h2586], Thinkest[^h5869] thou that David[^h1732] doth honour[^h3513] thy father[^h1], that he hath sent[^h7971] comforters[^h5162] unto thee? are not his servants[^h5650] come[^h935] unto thee for to search[^h2713], and to overthrow[^h2015], and to spy out[^h7270] the land[^h776]? 
###### 4
Wherefore Hanun[^h2586] took[^h3947] David's[^h1732] servants[^h5650], and shaved[^h1548] them, and cut off[^h3772] their garments[^h4063] in the midst[^h2677] hard by their buttocks[^h4667], and sent them away[^h7971].
###### 5
Then there went[^h3212] certain, and told[^h5046] David[^h1732] how the men[^h582] were served. And he sent[^h7971] to meet[^h7125] them: for the men[^h582] were greatly[^h3966] ashamed[^h3637]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Tarry[^h3427] at Jericho[^h3405] until your beards[^h2206] be grown[^h6779], and then return[^h7725].
###### 6
And when the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] saw[^h7200] that they had made themselves odious[^h887] to David[^h1732], Hanun[^h2586] and the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] sent[^h7971] a thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701] to hire[^h7936] them chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571] out of Mesopotamia[^h763], and out of Syriamaachah[^h758] [^h4601], and out of Zobah[^h6678]. 
###### 7
So they hired[^h7936] thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] thousand[^h505] chariots[^h7393], and the king[^h4428] of Maachah[^h4601] and his people[^h5971]; who came[^h935] and pitched[^h2583] before[^h6440] Medeba[^h4311]. And the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] gathered themselves together[^h622] from their cities[^h5892], and came[^h935] to battle[^h4421].
###### 8
And when David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] of it, he sent[^h7971] Joab[^h3097], and all the host[^h6635] of the mighty men[^h1368].
###### 9
And the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] came out[^h3318], and put the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] before the gate[^h6607] of the city[^h5892]: and the kings[^h4428] that were come[^h935] were by themselves in the field[^h7704].
###### 10
Now when Joab[^h3097] saw[^h7200] that the battle[^h4421] was set against him before[^h6440] and behind[^h268], he chose out[^h977] of all the choice[^h977] of Israel[^h3478], and put them in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the Syrians[^h758].  
###### 11
And the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] he delivered[^h5414] unto the hand[^h3027] of Abishai[^h52] his brother[^h251], and they set themselves in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]. 
###### 12
And he said[^h559], If the Syrians[^h758] be too strong[^h2388] for me, then thou shalt help[^h8668] me: but if the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] be too strong[^h2388] for thee, then I will help[^h3467] thee.
###### 13
Be of good courage[^h2388], and let us behave ourselves valiantly[^h2388] for our people[^h5971], and for the cities[^h5892] of our God[^h430]: and let the LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] that which is good[^h2896] in his sight[^h5869].
###### 14
So Joab[^h3097] and the people[^h5971] that were with him drew nigh[^h5066] before[^h6440] the Syrians[^h758] unto the battle[^h4421]; and they fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] him.
###### 15
And when the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] saw[^h7200] that the Syrians[^h758] were fled[^h5127], they likewise fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] Abishai[^h52] his brother[^h251], and entered[^h935] into the city[^h5892]. Then Joab[^h3097] came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 16
And when the Syrians[^h758] saw[^h7200] that they were put to the worse[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], they sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397], and drew forth[^h3318] the Syrians[^h758] that were beyond[^h5676] the river[^h5104]: and Shophach[^h7780] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of Hadarezer[^h1928] went before[^h6440] them.  
###### 17
And it was told[^h5046] David[^h1732]; and he gathered[^h622] all Israel[^h3478], and passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and came[^h935] upon them, and set the battle in array[^h6186] against them. So when David[^h1732] had put the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the Syrians[^h758], they fought[^h3898] with him.
###### 18
But the Syrians[^h758] fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478]; and David[^h1732] slew[^h2026] of the Syrians[^h758] seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] men which fought in chariots[^h7393], and forty[^h705] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h376] [^h7273], and killed[^h4191] Shophach[^h7780] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635].
###### 19
And when the servants[^h5650] of Hadarezer[^h1928] saw[^h7200] that they were put to the worse[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], they made peace[^h7999] with David[^h1732], and became his servants[^h5647]: neither would[^h14] the Syrians[^h758] help[^h3467] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] any more.

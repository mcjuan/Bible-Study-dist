###### 17
And the porters[^h7778] were, Shallum[^h7967], and Akkub[^h6126], and Talmon[^h2929], and Ahiman[^h289], and their brethren[^h251]: Shallum[^h7967] was the chief[^h7218];
###### 18
Who hitherto waited in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179] eastward[^h4217]: they were porters[^h7778] in the companies[^h4264] of the children[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878].
###### 19
And Shallum[^h7967] the son[^h1121] of Kore[^h6981], the son[^h1121] of Ebiasaph[^h43], the son[^h1121] of Korah[^h7141], and his brethren[^h251], of the house[^h1004] of his father[^h1], the Korahites[^h7145], were over the work[^h4399] of the service[^h5656], keepers[^h8104] of the gates[^h5592] of the tabernacle[^h168]: and their fathers[^h1], being over the host[^h4264] of the LORD[^h3068], were keepers[^h8104] of the entry[^h3996]. 
###### 20
And Phinehas[^h6372] the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499] was the ruler[^h5057] over them in time past[^h6440], and the LORD[^h3068] was with him.
###### 21

###### 22
All these which were chosen[^h1305] to be porters[^h7778] in the gates[^h5592] were two hundred[^h3967] and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240]. These were reckoned by their genealogy[^h3187] in their villages[^h2691], whom[^h1992] David[^h1732] and Samuel[^h8050] the seer[^h7200] did ordain[^h3245] in their set office[^h530].  
###### 23
So they and their children[^h1121] had the oversight of the gates[^h8179] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], namely, the house[^h1004] of the tabernacle[^h168], by wards[^h4931].

###### 26
For these Levites[^h3881], the four[^h702] chief[^h1368] porters[^h7778], were in their set office[^h530], and were over the chambers[^h3957] and treasuries[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].  
###### 27
And they lodged[^h3885] round about[^h5439] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], because the charge[^h4931] was upon them, and the opening[^h4668] thereof every morning[^h1242] pertained to them.
###### 28
And certain of them had the charge of[^h5921] the ministering[^h5656] vessels[^h3627], that they should bring them in[^h935] and out[^h3318] by tale[^h4557] [^h4557].

Some of them also were appointed[^h4487] to oversee the vessels[^h3627], and all the instruments[^h3627] of the sanctuary[^h6944], and the fine flour[^h5560], and the wine[^h3196], and the oil[^h8081], and the frankincense[^h3828], and the spices[^h1314].

###### 32
And other of their brethren[^h251], of the sons[^h1121] of the Kohathites[^h6956], were over the shewbread[^h3899] [^h4635], to prepare[^h3559] it every sabbath[^h7676]. 
###### 33
And these are the singers[^h7891], chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of the Levites[^h3881], who remaining in the chambers[^h3957] were free[^h6362] [^h6359]: for they were employed in that work[^h4399] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915]. 
###### 34
These chief[^h7218] fathers[^h1] of the Levites[^h3881] were chief[^h7218] throughout their generations[^h8435]; these dwelt[^h3427] at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 35

###### 39
And Ner[^h5369] begat[^h3205] Kish[^h7027]; and Kish[^h7027] begat[^h3205] Saul[^h7586]; and Saul[^h7586] begat[^h3205] Jonathan[^h3083], and Malchishua[^h4444], and Abinadab[^h41], and Eshbaal[^h792].

###### 42
And Ahaz[^h271] begat[^h3205] Jarah[^h3294]; and Jarah[^h3294] begat[^h3205] Alemeth[^h5964], and Azmaveth[^h5820], and Zimri[^h2174]; and Zimri[^h2174] begat[^h3205] Moza[^h4162];

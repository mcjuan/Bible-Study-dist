###### 1
So they brought[^h935] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], and set[^h3322] it in the midst[^h8432] of the tent[^h168] that David[^h1732] had pitched[^h5186] for it: and they offered[^h7126] burnt sacrifices[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002] before[^h6440] God[^h430].
###### 2
And when David[^h1732] had made an end[^h3615] of offering[^h5927] the burnt offerings[^h5930] and the peace offerings[^h8002], he blessed[^h1288] the people[^h5971] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And he dealt[^h2505] to every one[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], both man[^h376] and woman[^h802], to every one[^h376] a loaf[^h3603] of bread[^h3899], and a good piece of flesh[^h829], and a flagon[^h809] of wine.
###### 4
And he appointed[^h5414] certain of the Levites[^h3881] to minister[^h8334] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and to record[^h2142], and to thank[^h3034] and praise[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 5
Asaph[^h623] the chief[^h7218], and next[^h4932] to him Zechariah[^h2148], Jeiel[^h3273], and Shemiramoth[^h8070], and Jehiel[^h3171], and Mattithiah[^h4993], and Eliab[^h446], and Benaiah[^h1141], and Obededom[^h5654]: and Jeiel[^h3273] with psalteries[^h5035] [^h3627] and with harps[^h3658]; but Asaph[^h623] made a sound[^h8085] with cymbals[^h4700]; 
###### 6
Benaiah[^h1141] also and Jahaziel[^h3166] the priests[^h3548] with trumpets[^h2689] continually[^h8548] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430].
###### 7
Then on that day[^h3117] David[^h1732] delivered[^h5414] first[^h7218] this psalm to thank[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] into the hand[^h3027] of Asaph[^h623] and his brethren[^h251].
###### 8
Give thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068], call[^h7121] upon his name[^h8034], make known[^h3045] his deeds[^h5949] among the people[^h5971].
###### 9
Sing[^h7891] unto him, sing psalms[^h2167] unto him, talk[^h7878] ye of all his wondrous[^h6381] works.
###### 10
Glory[^h1984] ye in his holy[^h6944] name[^h8034]: let the heart[^h3820] of them rejoice[^h8055] that seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
Seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] and his strength[^h5797], seek[^h1245] his face[^h6440] continually[^h8548].
###### 12
Remember[^h2142] his marvellous[^h6381] works that he hath done[^h6213], his wonders[^h4159], and the judgments[^h4941] of his mouth[^h6310];
###### 13
O ye seed[^h2233] of Israel[^h3478] his servant[^h5650], ye children[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290], his chosen ones[^h972].
###### 14
He is the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]; his judgments[^h4941] are in all the earth[^h776].
###### 15
Be ye mindful[^h2142] always[^h5769] of his covenant[^h1285]; the word[^h1697] which he commanded[^h6680] to a thousand[^h505] generations[^h1755];
###### 16
Even of the covenant which he made[^h3772] with Abraham[^h85], and of his oath[^h7621] unto Isaac[^h3327];
###### 17
And hath confirmed[^h5975] the same to Jacob[^h3290] for a law[^h2706], and to Israel[^h3478] for an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285],
###### 18
Saying[^h559], Unto thee will I give[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], the lot[^h2256] of your inheritance[^h5159]; 
###### 19
When ye were but few[^h4557] [^h4962], even a few[^h4592], and strangers[^h1481] in it. 
###### 20
And when they went[^h1980] from nation[^h1471] to nation[^h1471], and from one kingdom[^h4467] to another[^h312] people[^h5971];
###### 21
He suffered[^h3240] no man[^h376] to do them wrong[^h6231]: yea, he reproved[^h3198] kings[^h4428] for their sakes,
###### 22
Saying, Touch[^h5060] not mine anointed[^h4899], and do my prophets[^h5030] no harm[^h7489].
###### 23
Sing[^h7891] unto the LORD[^h3068], all the earth[^h776]; shew forth[^h1319] from day[^h3117] to day[^h3117] his salvation[^h3444].
###### 24
Declare[^h5608] his glory[^h3519] among the heathen[^h1471]; his marvellous works[^h6381] among all nations[^h5971].
###### 25
For great[^h1419] is the LORD[^h3068], and greatly[^h3966] to be praised[^h1984]: he also is to be feared[^h3372] above all gods[^h430].
###### 26
For all the gods[^h430] of the people[^h5971] are idols[^h457]: but the LORD[^h3068] made[^h6213] the heavens[^h8064].
###### 27
Glory[^h1935] and honour[^h1926] are in his presence[^h6440]; strength[^h5797] and gladness[^h2304] are in his place[^h4725].
###### 28
Give[^h3051] unto the LORD[^h3068], ye kindreds[^h4940] of the people[^h5971], give[^h3051] unto the LORD[^h3068] glory[^h3519] and strength[^h5797].
###### 29
Give[^h3051] unto the LORD[^h3068] the glory[^h3519] due unto his name[^h8034]: bring[^h5375] an offering[^h4503], and come[^h935] before[^h6440] him: worship[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068] in the beauty[^h1927] of holiness[^h6944].
###### 30
Fear[^h2342] before[^h6440] him, all the earth[^h776]: the world[^h8398] also shall be stable[^h3559], that it be not moved[^h4131].
###### 31
Let the heavens[^h8064] be glad[^h8055], and let the earth[^h776] rejoice[^h1523]: and let men say[^h559] among the nations[^h1471], The LORD[^h3068] reigneth[^h4427].
###### 32
Let the sea[^h3220] roar[^h7481], and the fulness[^h4393] thereof: let the fields[^h7704] rejoice[^h5970], and all that is therein.
###### 33
Then shall the trees[^h6086] of the wood[^h3293] sing out[^h7442] at the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], because he cometh[^h935] to judge[^h8199] the earth[^h776].
###### 34
O give thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068]; for he is good[^h2896]; for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769].
###### 35
And say[^h559] ye, Save[^h3467] us, O God[^h430] of our salvation[^h3468], and gather us together[^h6908], and deliver[^h5337] us from the heathen[^h1471], that we may give thanks[^h3034] to thy holy[^h6944] name[^h8034], and glory[^h7623] in thy praise[^h8416].
###### 36
Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769] and ever[^h5769]. And all the people[^h5971] said[^h559], Amen[^h543], and praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 37
So he left[^h5800] there before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] Asaph[^h623] and his brethren[^h251], to minister[^h8334] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] continually[^h8548], as every day's[^h3117] work[^h1697] required[^h3117]:
###### 38
And Obededom[^h5654] with their brethren[^h251], threescore[^h8346] and eight[^h8083]; Obededom[^h5654] also the son[^h1121] of Jeduthun[^h3038] and Hosah[^h2621] to be porters[^h7778]:
###### 39
And Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and his brethren[^h251] the priests[^h3548], before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068] in the high place[^h1116] that was at Gibeon[^h1391],
###### 40
To offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068] upon the altar[^h4196] of the burnt offering[^h5930] continually[^h8548] morning[^h1242] and evening[^h6153], and to do according to all that is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068], which he commanded[^h6680] Israel[^h3478]; 
###### 41
And with them Heman[^h1968] and Jeduthun[^h3038], and the rest[^h7605] that were chosen[^h1305], who were expressed[^h5344] by name[^h8034], to give thanks[^h3034] to the LORD[^h3068], because his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769];
###### 42
And with them Heman[^h1968] and Jeduthun[^h3038] with trumpets[^h2689] and cymbals[^h4700] for those that should make a sound[^h8085], and with musical[^h7892] instruments[^h3627] of God[^h430]. And the sons[^h1121] of Jeduthun[^h3038] were porters[^h8179]. 
###### 43
And all the people[^h5971] departed[^h3212] every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004]: and David[^h1732] returned[^h5437] to bless[^h1288] his house[^h1004].

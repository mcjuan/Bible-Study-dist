###### 1
And Satan[^h7854] stood up[^h5975] against Israel[^h3478], and provoked[^h5496] David[^h1732] to number[^h4487] Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Joab[^h3097] and to the rulers[^h8269] of the people[^h5971], Go[^h3212], number[^h5608] Israel[^h3478] from Beersheba[^h884] even to Dan[^h1835]; and bring[^h935] the number[^h4557] of them to me, that I may know[^h3045] it.
###### 3
And Joab[^h3097] answered[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] make his people[^h5971] an hundred[^h3967] times[^h6471] so many more[^h3254] as they[^h1992] be: but, my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], are they not all my lord's[^h113] servants[^h5650]? why then doth my lord[^h113] require[^h1245] this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass[^h819] to Israel[^h3478]?
###### 4
Nevertheless the king's[^h4428] word[^h1697] prevailed[^h2388] against Joab[^h3097]. Wherefore Joab[^h3097] departed[^h3318], and went[^h1980] throughout all Israel[^h3478], and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 5
And Joab[^h3097] gave[^h5414] the sum[^h4557] of the number[^h4662] of the people[^h5971] unto David[^h1732]. And all they of Israel[^h3478] were a thousand[^h505] thousand[^h505] and an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719]: and Judah[^h3063] was four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] threescore and ten[^h7657] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719].
###### 6
But Levi[^h3878] and Benjamin[^h1144] counted[^h6485] he not among[^h8432] them: for the king's[^h4428] word[^h1697] was abominable[^h8581] to Joab[^h3097].
###### 7
And God[^h430] was displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] with this thing[^h1697]; therefore he smote[^h5221] Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 8
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], I have sinned[^h2398] greatly[^h3966], because I have done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]: but now, I beseech thee, do away[^h5674] the iniquity[^h5771] of thy servant[^h5650]; for I have done very[^h3966] foolishly[^h5528].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Gad[^h1410], David's[^h1732] seer[^h2374], saying[^h559],
###### 10
Go[^h3212] and tell[^h1696] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], I offer[^h5186] thee three[^h7969] things: choose[^h977] thee one[^h259] of them[^h2007], that I may do[^h6213] it unto thee. 
###### 11
So Gad[^h1410] came[^h935] to David[^h1732], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Choose[^h6901] thee 
###### 12
Either three[^h7969] years'[^h8141] famine[^h7458]; or three[^h7969] months[^h2320] to be destroyed[^h5595] before[^h6440] thy foes[^h6862], while that the sword[^h2719] of thine enemies[^h341] overtaketh[^h5381] thee; or[^h518] else three[^h7969] days[^h3117] the sword[^h2719] of the LORD[^h3068], even the pestilence[^h1698], in the land[^h776], and the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] destroying[^h7843] throughout all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]. Now therefore advise[^h7200] thyself what word[^h1697] I shall bring again[^h7725] to him that sent[^h7971] me.
###### 13
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Gad[^h1410], I am in a great[^h3966] strait[^h6887]: let me fall[^h5307] now into the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068]; for very[^h3966] great[^h7227] are his mercies[^h7356]: but let me not fall[^h5307] into the hand[^h3027] of man[^h120]. 
###### 14
So the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h5414] pestilence[^h1698] upon Israel[^h3478]: and there fell[^h5307] of Israel[^h3478] seventy[^h7657] thousand[^h505] men[^h376].
###### 15
And God[^h430] sent[^h7971] an angel[^h4397] unto Jerusalem[^h3389] to destroy[^h7843] it: and as he was destroying[^h7843], the LORD[^h3068] beheld[^h7200], and he repented[^h5162] him of the evil[^h7451], and said[^h559] to the angel[^h4397] that destroyed[^h7843], It is enough[^h7227], stay[^h7503] now thine hand[^h3027]. And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h5975] by the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Ornan[^h771] the Jebusite[^h2983]. 
###### 16
And David[^h1732] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] stand[^h5975] between the earth[^h776] and the heaven[^h8064], having a drawn[^h8025] sword[^h2719] in his hand[^h3027] stretched out[^h5186] over Jerusalem[^h3389]. Then David[^h1732] and the elders[^h2205] of Israel, who were clothed[^h3680] in sackcloth[^h8242], fell[^h5307] upon their faces[^h6440].
###### 17
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], Is it not I that commanded[^h559] the people[^h5971] to be numbered[^h4487]? even I it is that have sinned[^h2398] and done evil[^h7489] indeed[^h7489]; but as for these sheep[^h6629], what have they done[^h6213]? let thine hand[^h3027], I pray thee, O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], be on me, and on my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]; but not on thy people[^h5971], that they should be plagued[^h4046].
###### 18
Then the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h559] Gad[^h1410] to say[^h559] to David[^h1732], that David[^h1732] should go up[^h5927], and set up[^h6965] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068] in the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Ornan[^h771] the Jebusite[^h2983].
###### 19
And David[^h1732] went up[^h5927] at the saying[^h1697] of Gad[^h1410], which he spake[^h1696] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
And Ornan[^h771] turned back[^h7725], and saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397]; and his four[^h702] sons[^h1121] with him hid[^h2244] themselves. Now Ornan[^h771] was threshing[^h1758] wheat[^h2406]. 
###### 21
And as David[^h1732] came[^h935] to Ornan[^h771], Ornan[^h771] looked[^h5027] and saw[^h7200] David[^h1732], and went out[^h3318] of the threshingfloor[^h1637], and bowed[^h7812] himself to David[^h1732] with his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776].
###### 22
Then David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Ornan[^h771], Grant[^h5414] me the place[^h4725] of this threshingfloor[^h1637], that I may build[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] therein unto the LORD[^h3068]: thou shalt grant[^h5414] it me for the full[^h4392] price[^h3701]: that the plague[^h4046] may be stayed[^h6113] from the people[^h5971]. 
###### 23
And Ornan[^h771] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Take[^h3947] it to thee, and let my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] do[^h6213] that which is good[^h2896] in his eyes[^h5869]: lo[^h7200], I give[^h5414] thee the oxen[^h1241] also for burnt offerings[^h5930], and the threshing instruments[^h4173] for wood[^h6086], and the wheat[^h2406] for the meat offering[^h4503]; I give[^h5414] it all.
###### 24
And king[^h4428] David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Ornan[^h771], Nay; but I will verily[^h7069] buy[^h7069] it for the full[^h4392] price[^h3701]: for I will not take[^h5375] that which is thine for the LORD[^h3068], nor offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] without cost[^h2600].
###### 25
So David[^h1732] gave[^h5414] to Ornan[^h771] for the place[^h4725] six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels[^h8255] of gold[^h2091] by weight[^h4948].
###### 26
And David[^h1732] built[^h1129] there an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002], and called[^h7121] upon the LORD[^h3068]; and he answered[^h6030] him from heaven[^h8064] by fire[^h784] upon the altar[^h4196] of burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h559] the angel[^h4397]; and he put up[^h7725] his sword[^h2719] again[^h7725] into the sheath[^h5084] thereof.
###### 28
At that time[^h6256] when David[^h1732] saw[^h7200] that the LORD[^h3068] had answered[^h6030] him in the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Ornan[^h771] the Jebusite[^h2983], then he sacrificed[^h2076] there.
###### 29
For the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068], which Moses[^h4872] made[^h6213] in the wilderness[^h4057], and the altar[^h4196] of the burnt offering[^h5930], were at that season[^h6256] in the high place[^h1116] at Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 30
But David[^h1732] could[^h3201] not go[^h3212] before[^h6440] it to enquire[^h1875] of God[^h430]: for he was afraid[^h1204] because[^h6440] of the sword[^h2719] of the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068].

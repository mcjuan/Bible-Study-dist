###### 1
Then David[^h1732] said[^h559], This is the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], and this is the altar[^h4196] of the burnt offering[^h5930] for Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And David[^h1732] commanded[^h559] to gather together[^h3664] the strangers[^h1616] that were in the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478]; and he set[^h5975] masons[^h2672] to hew[^h2672] wrought[^h1496] stones[^h68] to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].
###### 3
And David[^h1732] prepared[^h3559] iron[^h1270] in abundance[^h7230] for the nails[^h4548] for the doors[^h1817] of the gates[^h8179], and for the joinings[^h4226]; and brass[^h5178] in abundance[^h7230] without weight[^h4948];
###### 4
Also cedar[^h730] trees[^h6086] in abundance[^h369] [^h4557]: for the Zidonians[^h6722] and they of Tyre[^h6876] brought[^h935] much[^h7230] cedar[^h730] wood[^h6086] to David[^h1732].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121] is young[^h5288] and tender[^h7390], and the house[^h1004] that is to be builded[^h1129] for the LORD[^h3068] must be exceeding[^h4605] magnifical[^h1431], of fame[^h8034] and of glory[^h8597] throughout all countries[^h776]: I will therefore now make preparation[^h3559] for it. So David[^h1732] prepared[^h3559] abundantly[^h7230] before[^h6440] his death[^h4194].
###### 6
Then he called[^h7121] for Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], and charged[^h6680] him to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Solomon[^h8010], My son[^h1121], as for me, it was in my mind[^h3824] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430]:
###### 8
But the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to me, saying[^h559], Thou hast shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818] abundantly[^h7230], and hast made[^h6213] great[^h1419] wars[^h4421]: thou shalt not build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto my name[^h8034], because thou hast shed[^h8210] much[^h7227] blood[^h1818] upon the earth[^h776] in my sight[^h6440].
###### 9
Behold, a son[^h1121] shall be born[^h3205] to thee, who shall be a man[^h376] of rest[^h4496]; and I will give him rest[^h5117] from all his enemies[^h341] round about[^h5439]: for his name[^h8034] shall be Solomon[^h8010], and I will give[^h5414] peace[^h7965] and quietness[^h8253] unto Israel[^h3478] in his days[^h3117]. 
###### 10
He shall build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for my name[^h8034]; and he shall be my son[^h1121], and I will be his father[^h1]; and I will establish[^h3559] the throne[^h3678] of his kingdom[^h4438] over Israel[^h3478] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 11
Now, my son[^h1121], the LORD[^h3068] be with thee; and prosper[^h6743] thou, and build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], as he hath said[^h1696] of thee.
###### 12
Only the LORD[^h3068] give[^h5414] thee wisdom[^h7922] and understanding[^h998], and give thee charge[^h6680] concerning Israel[^h3478], that thou mayest keep[^h8104] the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430].
###### 13
Then shalt thou prosper[^h6743], if thou takest heed[^h8104] to fulfil[^h6213] the statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941] which the LORD[^h3068] charged[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] with concerning Israel[^h3478]: be strong[^h2388], and of good courage[^h553]; dread[^h3372] not, nor be dismayed[^h2865].
###### 14
Now, behold, in my trouble[^h6040] I have prepared[^h3559] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], and a thousand[^h505] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701]; and of brass[^h5178] and iron[^h1270] without weight[^h4948]; for it is in abundance[^h7230]: timber[^h6086] also and stone[^h68] have I prepared[^h3559]; and thou mayest add[^h3254] thereto. 
###### 15
Moreover there are workmen[^h6213] [^h4399] with thee in abundance[^h7230], hewers[^h2672] and workers[^h2796] of stone[^h68] and timber[^h6086], and all manner of cunning men[^h2450] for every manner of work[^h4399]. 
###### 16
Of the gold[^h2091], the silver[^h3701], and the brass[^h5178], and the iron[^h1270], there is no number[^h4557]. Arise[^h6965] therefore, and be doing[^h6213], and the LORD[^h3068] be with thee.
###### 17
David[^h1732] also commanded[^h6680] all the princes[^h8269] of Israel[^h3478] to help[^h5826] Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], saying,
###### 18
Is not the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] with you? and hath he not given you rest[^h5117] on every side[^h5439]? for he hath given[^h5414] the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] into mine hand[^h3027]; and the land[^h776] is subdued[^h3533] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and before[^h6440] his people[^h5971].
###### 19
Now set[^h5414] your heart[^h3824] and your soul[^h5315] to seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; arise[^h6965] therefore, and build[^h1129] ye the sanctuary[^h4720] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], to bring[^h935] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and the holy[^h6944] vessels[^h3627] of God[^h430], into the house[^h1004] that is to be built[^h1129] to the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
Furthermore David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto all the congregation[^h6951], Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121], whom alone[^h259] God[^h430] hath chosen[^h977], is yet young[^h5288] and tender[^h7390], and the work[^h4399] is great[^h1419]: for the palace[^h1002] is not for man[^h120], but for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430].
###### 2
Now I have prepared[^h3559] with all my might[^h3581] for the house[^h1004] of my God[^h430] the gold[^h2091] for things to be made of gold[^h2091], and the silver[^h3701] for things of silver[^h3701], and the brass[^h5178] for things of brass[^h5178], the iron[^h1270] for things of iron[^h1270], and wood[^h6086] for things of wood[^h6086]; onyx[^h7718] stones[^h68], and stones to be set[^h4394], glistering[^h6320] stones[^h68], and of divers colours[^h7553], and all manner of precious[^h3368] stones[^h68], and marble[^h7893] stones[^h68] in abundance[^h7230].
###### 3
Moreover, because I have set my affection[^h7521] to the house[^h1004] of my God[^h430], I have[^h3426] of mine own proper good[^h5459], of gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701], which I have given[^h5414] to the house[^h1004] of my God[^h430], over and above[^h4605] all that I have prepared[^h3559] for the holy[^h6944] house[^h1004],
###### 4
Even three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], of the gold[^h2091] of Ophir[^h211], and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of refined[^h2212] silver[^h3701], to overlay[^h2902] the walls[^h7023] of the houses[^h1004] withal:
###### 5
The gold[^h2091] for things of gold[^h2091], and the silver[^h3701] for things of silver[^h3701], and for all manner of work[^h4399] to be made by the hands[^h3027] of artificers[^h2796]. And who then is willing[^h5068] to consecrate[^h4390] his service[^h3027] this day[^h3117] unto the LORD[^h3068]? 
###### 6
Then the chief[^h8269] of the fathers[^h1] and princes[^h8269] of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], and the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505] and of hundreds[^h3967], with the rulers[^h8269] of the king's[^h4428] work[^h4399], offered willingly[^h5068],
###### 7
And gave[^h5414] for the service[^h5656] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] of gold[^h2091] five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] and ten thousand[^h7239] drams[^h150], and of silver[^h3701] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603], and of brass[^h5178] eighteen[^h8083] [^h7239] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603], and one hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of iron[^h1270].
###### 8
And they with whom precious stones[^h68] were found[^h4672] gave[^h5414] them to the treasure[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], by the hand[^h3027] of Jehiel[^h3171] the Gershonite[^h1649].
###### 9
Then the people[^h5971] rejoiced[^h8055], for that they offered willingly[^h5068], because with perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3820] they offered willingly[^h5068] to the LORD[^h3068]: and David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] also rejoiced[^h8055] with great[^h1419] joy[^h8057].
###### 10
Wherefore David[^h1732] blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068] before[^h5869] all the congregation[^h6951]: and David[^h1732] said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be thou, LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] our father[^h1], for[^h5704] ever[^h5769] and ever[^h5769].
###### 11
Thine, O LORD[^h3068], is the greatness[^h1420], and the power[^h1369], and the glory[^h8597], and the victory[^h5331], and the majesty[^h1935]: for all that is in the heaven[^h8064] and in the earth[^h776] is thine; thine is the kingdom[^h4467], O LORD[^h3068], and thou art exalted[^h4984] as head[^h7218] above all.
###### 12
Both riches[^h6239] and honour[^h3519] come of thee[^h6440], and thou reignest[^h4910] over all; and in thine hand[^h3027] is power[^h3581] and might[^h1369]; and in thine hand[^h3027] it is to make great[^h1431], and to give strength[^h2388] unto all.
###### 13
Now therefore, our God[^h430], we thank[^h3034] thee, and praise[^h1984] thy glorious[^h8597] name[^h8034].
###### 14
But who am I, and what is my people[^h5971], that we should be[^h6113] able[^h3581] to offer so willingly[^h5068] after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own[^h3027] have we given[^h5414] thee.  
###### 15
For we are strangers[^h1616] before[^h6440] thee, and sojourners[^h8453], as were all our fathers[^h1]: our days[^h3117] on the earth[^h776] are as a shadow[^h6738], and there is none abiding[^h4723]. 
###### 16
O LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], all this store[^h1995] that we have prepared[^h3559] to build[^h1129] thee an house[^h1004] for thine holy[^h6944] name[^h8034] cometh of thine hand[^h3027], and is all thine own.
###### 17
I know[^h3045] also, my God[^h430], that thou triest[^h974] the heart[^h3824], and hast pleasure[^h7521] in uprightness[^h3476]. As for me, in the uprightness[^h4339] of mine heart[^h3824] I have willingly offered[^h5068] all these things: and now have I seen[^h7200] with joy[^h8057] thy people[^h5971], which are present[^h4672] here, to offer willingly[^h5068] unto thee. 
###### 18
O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and of Israel[^h3478], our fathers[^h1], keep[^h8104] this for ever[^h5769] in the imagination[^h3336] of the thoughts[^h4284] of the heart[^h3824] of thy people[^h5971], and prepare[^h3559] their heart[^h3824] unto thee: 
###### 19
And give[^h5414] unto Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121] a perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3824], to keep[^h8104] thy commandments[^h4687], thy testimonies[^h5715], and thy statutes[^h2706], and to do[^h6213] all these things, and to build[^h1129] the palace[^h1002], for the which I have made provision[^h3559].
###### 20
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to all the congregation[^h6951], Now bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]. And all the congregation[^h6951] blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], and bowed down their heads[^h6915], and worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068], and the king[^h4428].
###### 21
And they sacrificed[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] unto the LORD[^h3068], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068], on the morrow[^h4283] after that day[^h3117], even a thousand[^h505] bullocks[^h6499], a thousand[^h505] rams[^h352], and a thousand[^h505] lambs[^h3532], with their drink offerings[^h5262], and sacrifices[^h2077] in abundance[^h7230] for all Israel[^h3478]:
###### 22
And did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] on that day[^h3117] with great[^h1419] gladness[^h8057]. And they made Solomon[^h8010] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] king[^h4427] the second time[^h8145], and anointed[^h4886] him unto the LORD[^h3068] to be the chief governor[^h5057], and Zadok[^h6659] to be priest[^h3548].
###### 23
Then Solomon[^h8010] sat on[^h3427] the throne[^h3678] of the LORD[^h3068] as king[^h4428] instead of David[^h1732] his father[^h1], and prospered[^h6743]; and all Israel[^h3478] obeyed[^h8085] him.
###### 24
And all the princes[^h8269], and the mighty men[^h1368], and all the sons[^h1121] likewise of king[^h4428] David[^h1732], submitted themselves[^h5414] [^h3027] [^h8478] unto Solomon[^h8010] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 25
And the LORD[^h3068] magnified[^h1431] Solomon[^h8010] exceedingly[^h4605] in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478], and bestowed[^h5414] upon him such royal[^h4438] majesty[^h1935] as had not been on any king[^h4428] before[^h6440] him in Israel[^h3478].
###### 26
Thus David[^h1732] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] reigned[^h4427] over all Israel[^h3478].
###### 27
And the time[^h3117] that he reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] was forty[^h705] years[^h8141]; seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Hebron[^h2275], and thirty[^h7970] and three[^h7969] years reigned[^h4427] he in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 28
And he died[^h4191] in a good[^h2896] old age[^h7872], full[^h7649] of days[^h3117], riches[^h6239], and honour[^h3519]: and Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 29
Now the acts[^h1697] of David[^h1732] the king[^h4428], first[^h7223] and last[^h314], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h1697] of Samuel[^h8050] the seer[^h7200], and in the book[^h1697] of Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and in the book[^h1697] of Gad[^h1410] the seer[^h2374], 
###### 30
With all his reign[^h4438] and his might[^h1369], and the times[^h6256] that went over[^h5674] him, and over Israel[^h3478], and over all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the countries[^h776].

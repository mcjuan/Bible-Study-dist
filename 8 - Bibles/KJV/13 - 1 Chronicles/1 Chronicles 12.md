Now these are they that came[^h935] to David[^h1732] to Ziklag[^h6860], while he yet kept himself close[^h6113] because[^h6440] of Saul[^h7586] the son[^h1121] of Kish[^h7027]: and they were among the mighty men[^h1368], helpers[^h5826] of the war[^h4421]. 
###### 2
They were armed[^h5401] with bows[^h7198], and could use both the right hand[^h3231] and the left[^h8041] in hurling stones[^h68] and shooting arrows[^h2671] out of a bow[^h7198], even of Saul's[^h7586] brethren[^h251] of Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 3
The chief[^h7218] was Ahiezer[^h295], then Joash[^h3101], the sons[^h1121] of Shemaah[^h8094] the Gibeathite[^h1395]; and Jeziel[^h3149], and Pelet[^h6404], the sons[^h1121] of Azmaveth[^h5820]; and Berachah[^h1294], and Jehu[^h3058] the Antothite[^h6069],

###### 7
And Joelah[^h3132], and Zebadiah[^h2069], the sons[^h1121] of Jeroham[^h3395] of Gedor[^h1446].
###### 8
And of the Gadites[^h1425] there separated[^h914] themselves unto David[^h1732] into the hold[^h4679] to the wilderness[^h4057] men[^h1368] of might[^h2428], and men[^h582] of war[^h6635] fit for the battle[^h4421], that could handle[^h6186] shield[^h6793] and buckler[^h7420], whose faces[^h6440] were like the faces[^h6440] of lions[^h738], and were as swift[^h4116] as the roes[^h6643] upon the mountains[^h2022];  
###### 9
Ezer[^h5829] the first[^h7218], Obadiah[^h5662] the second[^h8145], Eliab[^h446] the third[^h7992],

###### 11
Attai[^h6262] the sixth[^h8345], Eliel[^h447] the seventh[^h7637],
###### 12
Johanan[^h3110] the eighth[^h8066], Elzabad[^h443] the ninth[^h8671],
###### 13
Jeremiah[^h3414] the tenth[^h6224], Machbanai[^h4344] the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240].
###### 14
These were of the sons[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], captains[^h7218] of the host[^h6635]: one[^h259] of the least[^h6996] was over an hundred[^h3967], and the greatest[^h1419] over a thousand[^h505]. 
###### 15
These are they that went over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] in the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], when it had overflown[^h4390] all his banks[^h1415] [^h1428]; and they put to flight[^h1272] all them of the valleys[^h6010], both toward the east[^h4217], and toward the west[^h4628]. 
###### 16
And there came[^h935] of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] and Judah[^h3063] to the hold[^h4679] unto David[^h1732].
###### 17
And David[^h1732] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h6440] them, and answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto them, If ye be come[^h935] peaceably[^h7965] unto me to help[^h5826] me, mine heart[^h3824] shall be knit[^h3162] unto you: but if ye be come to betray[^h7411] me to mine enemies[^h6862], seeing there is no[^h3808] wrong[^h2555] in mine hands[^h3709], the God[^h430] of our fathers[^h1] look[^h7200] thereon, and rebuke[^h3198] it.   
###### 18
Then the spirit[^h7307] came[^h3847] upon Amasai[^h6022], who was chief[^h7218] of the captains[^h7970] [^h7991], and he said, Thine are we, David[^h1732], and on thy side, thou son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448]: peace[^h7965], peace[^h7965] be unto thee, and peace[^h7965] be to thine helpers[^h5826]; for thy God[^h430] helpeth[^h5826] thee. Then David[^h1732] received[^h6901] them, and made[^h5414] them captains[^h7218] of the band[^h1416]. 
###### 19
And there fell[^h5307] some of Manasseh[^h4519] to David[^h1732], when he came[^h935] with the Philistines[^h6430] against Saul[^h7586] to battle[^h4421]: but they helped[^h5826] them not: for the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] upon advisement[^h6098] sent[^h7971] him away, saying[^h559], He will fall[^h5307] to his master[^h113] Saul[^h7586] to the jeopardy of our heads[^h7218]. 
###### 20
As he went[^h3212] to Ziklag[^h6860], there fell[^h5307] to him of Manasseh[^h4519], Adnah[^h5734], and Jozabad[^h3107], and Jediael[^h3043], and Michael[^h4317], and Jozabad[^h3107], and Elihu[^h453], and Zilthai[^h6769], captains[^h7218] of the thousands[^h505] that were of Manasseh[^h4519].
###### 21
And they helped[^h5826] David[^h1732] against the band[^h1416] of the rovers: for they were all mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], and were captains[^h8269] in the host[^h6635]. 
###### 22
For at that time[^h6256] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117] there came[^h935] to David[^h1732] to help[^h5826] him, until it was a great[^h1419] host[^h4264], like the host[^h4264] of God[^h430].
###### 23
And these are the numbers[^h4557] of the bands[^h7218] that were ready armed[^h2502] to the war[^h6635], and came[^h935] to David[^h1732] to Hebron[^h2275], to turn[^h5437] the kingdom[^h4438] of Saul[^h7586] to him, according to the word[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 24
The children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] that bare[^h5375] shield[^h6793] and spear[^h7420] were six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] and eight[^h8083] hundred[^h3967], ready armed[^h2502] to the war[^h6635]. 
###### 25
Of the children[^h1121] of Simeon[^h8095], mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428] for the war[^h6635], seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] and one hundred[^h3967].
###### 26
Of the children[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] four[^h702] thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967].
###### 27

###### 28
And Zadok[^h6659], a young man[^h5288] mighty[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], and of his father's[^h1] house[^h1004] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] captains[^h8269].
###### 29
And of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144], the kindred[^h251] of Saul[^h7586], three[^h7969] thousand[^h505]: for hitherto the greatest[^h4768] part of them had kept[^h8104] the ward[^h4931] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586].

And of the children[^h1121] of Ephraim[^h669] twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] and eight[^h8083] hundred[^h3967], mighty[^h1368] men[^h582] of valour[^h2428], famous[^h8034] throughout the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1]. 
###### 31
And of the half[^h2677] tribe[^h4294] of Manasseh[^h4519] eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] thousand[^h505], which were expressed[^h5344] by name[^h8034], to come[^h935] and make David[^h1732] king[^h4427].
###### 32
And of the children[^h1121] of Issachar[^h3485], which were men that had understanding[^h998] [^h3045] of the times[^h6256], to know[^h3045] what Israel[^h3478] ought to do[^h6213]; the heads[^h7218] of them were two hundred[^h3967]; and all their brethren[^h251] were at their commandment[^h6310].
###### 33
Of Zebulun[^h2074], such as went forth[^h3318] to battle[^h6635], expert[^h6186] in war[^h4421], with all instruments[^h3627] of war[^h4421], fifty[^h2572] thousand[^h505], which could keep rank[^h5737]: they were not of double[^h3820] heart[^h3820].   
###### 34
And of Naphtali[^h5321] a thousand[^h505] captains[^h8269], and with them with shield[^h6793] and spear[^h2595] thirty[^h7970] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505].

###### 37
And on the other side[^h5676] of Jordan[^h3383], of the Reubenites[^h7206], and the Gadites[^h1425], and of the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], with all manner of instruments[^h3627] of war[^h6635] for the battle[^h4421], an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505].
###### 38
All these men[^h582] of war[^h4421], that could keep[^h5737] rank[^h4634], came[^h935] with a perfect[^h8003] heart[^h3820] to Hebron[^h2275], to make David[^h1732] king[^h4427] over all Israel[^h3478]: and all the rest[^h7611] also of Israel[^h3478] were of one[^h259] heart[^h3824] to make David[^h1732] king[^h4427].
###### 39
And there they were with David[^h1732] three[^h7969] days[^h3117], eating[^h398] and drinking[^h8354]: for their brethren[^h251] had prepared[^h3559] for them.
###### 40
Moreover they that were nigh[^h7138] them, even unto Issachar[^h3485] and Zebulun[^h2074] and Naphtali[^h5321], brought[^h935] bread[^h3899] on asses[^h2543], and on camels[^h1581], and on mules[^h6505], and on oxen[^h1241], and meat[^h3978], meal[^h7058], cakes[^h1690] of figs, and bunches of raisins[^h6778], and wine[^h3196], and oil[^h8081], and oxen[^h1241], and sheep[^h6629] abundantly[^h7230]: for there was joy[^h8057] in Israel[^h3478].

###### 1
And it came to pass, that after[^h6256] the year[^h8141] was expired[^h8666], at the time[^h6256] that kings[^h4428] go out[^h3318] to battle, Joab[^h3097] led forth[^h5090] the power[^h2428] of the army[^h6635], and wasted[^h7843] the country[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and came[^h935] and besieged[^h6696] Rabbah[^h7237]. But David[^h1732] tarried[^h3427] at Jerusalem[^h3389]. And Joab[^h3097] smote[^h5221] Rabbah[^h7237], and destroyed[^h2040] it. 
###### 2
And David[^h1732] took[^h3947] the crown[^h5850] of their king[^h4428] from off his head[^h7218], and found[^h4672] it to weigh[^h4948] a talent[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], and there were precious[^h3368] stones[^h68] in it; and it was set upon David's[^h1732] head[^h7218]: and he brought[^h3318] also exceeding[^h3966] much[^h7235] spoil[^h7998] out of the city[^h5892]. 
###### 3
And he brought out[^h3318] the people[^h5971] that were in it, and cut[^h7787] them with saws[^h4050], and with harrows[^h2757] of iron[^h1270], and with axes[^h4050]. Even so dealt[^h6213] David[^h1732] with all the cities[^h5892] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]. And David[^h1732] and all the people[^h5971] returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 4
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that there arose[^h5975] war[^h4421] at Gezer[^h1507] with the Philistines[^h6430]; at which time[^h227] Sibbechai[^h5444] the Hushathite[^h2843] slew[^h5221] Sippai[^h5598], that was of the children[^h3211] of the giant[^h7497]: and they were subdued[^h3665].   
###### 5
And there was war[^h4421] again with the Philistines[^h6430]; and Elhanan[^h445] the son[^h1121] of Jair[^h3265] slew[^h5221] Lahmi[^h3902] the brother[^h251] of Goliath[^h1555] the Gittite[^h1663], whose spear[^h2595] staff[^h6086] was like a weaver's[^h707] beam[^h4500]. 
###### 6
And yet again there was war[^h4421] at Gath[^h1661], where was a man[^h376] of great stature[^h4060], whose fingers[^h676] and toes[^h676] were four[^h702] and twenty[^h6242], six[^h8337] on each hand, and six[^h8337] on each foot: and he also was the son[^h3205] of the giant[^h7497].  
###### 7
But when he defied[^h2778] Israel[^h3478], Jonathan[^h3083] the son[^h1121] of Shimea[^h8092] David's[^h1732] brother[^h251] slew[^h5221] him.  
###### 8
These[^h411] were born[^h3205] unto the giant[^h7497] in Gath[^h1661]; and they fell[^h5307] by the hand[^h3027] of David[^h1732], and by the hand[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650].

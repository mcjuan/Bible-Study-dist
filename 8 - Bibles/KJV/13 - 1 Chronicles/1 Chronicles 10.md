###### 1
Now the Philistines[^h6430] fought[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478]; and the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] fled[^h5127] from before[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430], and fell down[^h5307] slain[^h2491] in mount[^h2022] Gilboa[^h1533]. 
###### 2
And the Philistines[^h6430] followed hard[^h1692] after[^h310] Saul[^h7586], and after[^h310] his sons[^h1121]; and the Philistines[^h6430] slew[^h5221] Jonathan[^h3129], and Abinadab[^h41], and Malchishua[^h4444], the sons[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586]. 
###### 3
And the battle[^h4421] went sore[^h3513] against Saul[^h7586], and the archers[^h3384] [^h7198] hit[^h4672] him, and he was wounded[^h2342] of the archers[^h3384].  
###### 4
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586] to his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], Draw[^h8025] thy sword[^h2719], and thrust[^h1856] me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised[^h6189] come[^h935] and abuse[^h5953] me. But his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] would[^h14] not; for he was sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372]. So Saul[^h7586] took[^h3947] a sword[^h2719], and fell[^h5307] upon it. 
###### 5
And when his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] saw[^h7200] that Saul[^h7586] was dead[^h4191], he fell[^h5307] likewise on the sword[^h2719], and died[^h4191].
###### 6
So Saul[^h7586] died[^h4191], and his three[^h7969] sons[^h1121], and all his house[^h1004] died[^h4191] together[^h3162].
###### 7
And when all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] that were in the valley[^h6010] saw[^h7200] that they fled[^h5127], and that Saul[^h7586] and his sons[^h1121] were dead[^h4191], then they forsook[^h5800] their cities[^h5892], and fled[^h5127]: and the Philistines[^h6430] came[^h935] and dwelt[^h3427] in them.
###### 8
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], when the Philistines[^h6430] came[^h935] to strip[^h6584] the slain[^h2491], that they found[^h4672] Saul[^h7586] and his sons[^h1121] fallen[^h5307] in mount[^h2022] Gilboa[^h1533].
###### 9
And when they had stripped[^h6584] him, they took[^h5375] his head[^h7218], and his armour[^h3627], and sent[^h7971] into the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430] round about[^h5439], to carry tidings[^h1319] unto their idols[^h6091], and to the people[^h5971].
###### 10
And they put[^h7760] his armour[^h3627] in the house[^h1004] of their gods[^h430], and fastened[^h8628] his head[^h1538] in the temple[^h1004] of Dagon[^h1712].
###### 11
And when all Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] heard[^h8085] all that the Philistines[^h6430] had done[^h6213] to Saul[^h7586],
###### 12
They arose[^h6965], all the valiant[^h2428] men[^h376], and took away[^h5375] the body[^h1480] of Saul[^h7586], and the bodies[^h1480] of his sons[^h1121], and brought[^h935] them to Jabesh[^h3003], and buried[^h6912] their bones[^h6106] under the oak[^h424] in Jabesh[^h3003], and fasted[^h6684] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117].
###### 13
So Saul[^h7586] died[^h4191] for his transgression[^h4604] which he committed[^h4603] against the LORD[^h3068], even against the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he kept[^h8104] not, and also for asking[^h7592] counsel of one that had a familiar spirit[^h178], to enquire[^h1875] of it; 
###### 14
And enquired[^h1875] not of the LORD[^h3068]: therefore he slew[^h4191] him, and turned[^h5437] the kingdom[^h4410] unto David[^h1732] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448].

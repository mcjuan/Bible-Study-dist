###### 1
Now it came to pass in the days[^h3117] when the judges[^h8199] ruled[^h8199], that there was a famine[^h7458] in the land[^h776]. And a certain man[^h376] of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063] went[^h3212] to sojourn[^h1481] in the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124], he, and his wife[^h802], and his two[^h8147] sons[^h1121]. 
###### 2
And the name[^h8034] of the man[^h376] was Elimelech[^h458], and the name[^h8034] of his wife[^h802] Naomi[^h5281], and the name[^h8034] of his two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] Mahlon[^h4248] and Chilion[^h3630], Ephrathites[^h673] of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063]. And they came[^h935] into the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124], and continued there. 
###### 3
And Elimelech[^h458] Naomi's[^h5281] husband[^h376] died[^h4191]; and she was left[^h7604], and her two[^h8147] sons[^h1121].
###### 4
And they took[^h5375] them wives[^h802] of the women[^h802] of Moab[^h4125]; the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Orpah[^h6204], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Ruth[^h7327]: and they dwelled[^h3427] there about ten[^h6235] years[^h8141].
###### 5
And Mahlon[^h4248] and Chilion[^h3630] died[^h4191] also both[^h8147] of them; and the woman[^h802] was left[^h7604] of her two[^h8147] sons[^h3206] and her husband[^h376].
###### 6
Then she arose[^h6965] with her daughters in law[^h3618], that she might return[^h7725] from the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124]: for she had heard[^h8085] in the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124] how that the LORD[^h3068] had visited[^h6485] his people[^h5971] in giving[^h5414] them bread[^h3899].
###### 7
Wherefore she went forth[^h3318] out of the place[^h4725] where she was, and her two[^h8147] daughters in law[^h3618] with her; and they went[^h3212] on the way[^h1870] to return[^h7725] unto the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 8
And Naomi[^h5281] said[^h559] unto her two[^h8147] daughters in law[^h3618], Go[^h3212], return[^h7725] each[^h802] to her mother's[^h517] house[^h1004]: the LORD[^h3068] deal[^h6213] kindly[^h2617] with you, as ye have dealt[^h6213] with the dead[^h4191], and with me.
###### 9
The LORD[^h3068] grant[^h5414] you that ye may find[^h4672] rest[^h4496], each[^h802] of you in the house[^h1004] of her husband[^h376]. Then she kissed[^h5401] them; and they lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 10
And they said[^h559] unto her, Surely we will return[^h7725] with thee unto thy people[^h5971].
###### 11
And Naomi[^h5281] said[^h559], Turn again[^h7725], my daughters[^h1323]: why will ye go[^h3212] with me? are there yet any more sons[^h1121] in my womb[^h4578], that they may be your husbands[^h582]?
###### 12
Turn again[^h7725], my daughters[^h1323], go[^h3212] your way; for I am too old[^h2204] to have an husband[^h376]. If I should say[^h559], I have[^h3426] hope[^h8615], if I should have an husband[^h376] also to night[^h3915], and should also bear[^h3205] sons[^h1121]; 
###### 13
Would ye tarry[^h7663] for them[^h3860] till they were grown[^h1431]? would ye stay[^h5702] for them[^h3860] from having husbands[^h376]? nay, my daughters[^h1323]; for it grieveth[^h4843] me much[^h3966] for your sakes that the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] is gone out[^h3318] against me.  
###### 14
And they lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963], and wept again[^h1058]: and Orpah[^h6204] kissed[^h5401] her mother in law[^h2545]; but Ruth[^h7327] clave[^h1692] unto her.
###### 15
And she said[^h559], Behold, thy sister in law[^h2994] is gone back[^h7725] unto her people[^h5971], and unto her gods[^h430]: return[^h7725] thou after[^h310] thy sister in law[^h2994].
###### 16
And Ruth[^h7327] said[^h559], Intreat[^h6293] me not to leave[^h5800] thee, or to return[^h7725] from following after[^h310] thee: for whither thou goest[^h3212], I will go[^h3212]; and where thou lodgest[^h3885], I will lodge[^h3885]: thy people[^h5971] shall be my people[^h5971], and thy God[^h430] my God[^h430]: 
###### 17
Where thou diest[^h4191], will I die[^h4191], and there will I be buried[^h6912]: the LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] so to me, and more[^h3254] also, if ought but death[^h4194] part[^h6504] thee and me.
###### 18
When she saw[^h7200] that she was stedfastly minded[^h553] to go[^h3212] with her, then she left[^h2308] speaking[^h1696] unto her. 
###### 19
So they two[^h8147] went[^h3212] until they came[^h935] to Bethlehem[^h1035]. And it came to pass, when they were come[^h935] to Bethlehem[^h1035], that all the city[^h5892] was moved[^h1949] about them, and they said[^h559], Is this Naomi[^h5281]?
###### 20
And she said[^h559] unto them, Call[^h7121] me not Naomi[^h5281], call[^h7121] me Mara[^h4755]: for the Almighty[^h7706] hath dealt very[^h3966] bitterly[^h4843] with me.  
###### 21
I went out[^h1980] full[^h4392], and the LORD[^h3068] hath brought me home again[^h7725] empty[^h7387]: why then call[^h7121] ye me Naomi[^h5281], seeing the LORD[^h3068] hath testified[^h6030] against me, and the Almighty[^h7706] hath afflicted[^h7489] me?
###### 22
So Naomi[^h5281] returned[^h7725], and Ruth[^h7327] the Moabitess[^h4125], her daughter in law[^h3618], with her, which returned[^h7725] out of the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124]: and they came[^h935] to Bethlehem[^h1035] in the beginning[^h8462] of barley[^h8184] harvest[^h7105].

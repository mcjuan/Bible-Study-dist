###### 1
Then went[^h5927] Boaz[^h1162] up[^h5927] to the gate[^h8179], and sat him down[^h3427] there: and, behold, the kinsman[^h1350] of whom Boaz[^h1162] spake[^h1696] came[^h5674] by; unto whom he said[^h559], Ho[^h1945], such[^h6423] a one[^h492]! turn aside[^h5493], sit down[^h3427] here. And he turned aside[^h5493], and sat down[^h3427].
###### 2
And he took[^h3947] ten[^h6235] men[^h582] of the elders[^h2205] of the city[^h5892], and said[^h559], Sit ye down[^h3427] here. And they sat down[^h3427].
###### 3
And he said[^h559] unto the kinsman[^h1350], Naomi[^h5281], that is come again[^h7725] out of the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124], selleth[^h4376] a parcel[^h2513] of land[^h7704], which was our brother[^h251] Elimelech's[^h458]:
###### 4
And I thought[^h559] to advertise[^h1540] [^h241] thee, saying[^h559], Buy[^h7069] it before the inhabitants[^h3427], and before the elders[^h2205] of my people[^h5971]. If thou wilt redeem[^h1350] it, redeem[^h1350] it: but if thou wilt not redeem[^h1350] it, then tell[^h5046] me, that I may know[^h3045]: for there is none to redeem[^h1350] it beside[^h2108] thee; and I am after[^h310] thee. And he said[^h559], I will redeem[^h1350] it. 
###### 5
Then said[^h559] Boaz[^h1162], What day[^h3117] thou buyest[^h7069] the field[^h7704] of the hand[^h3027] of Naomi[^h5281], thou must buy[^h7069] it also of Ruth[^h7327] the Moabitess[^h4125], the wife[^h802] of the dead[^h4191], to raise up[^h6965] the name[^h8034] of the dead[^h4191] upon his inheritance[^h5159].
###### 6
And the kinsman[^h1350] said[^h559], I cannot[^h3201] redeem[^h1350] it for myself, lest I mar[^h7843] mine own inheritance[^h5159]: redeem[^h1350] thou my right[^h1353] to thyself; for I cannot[^h3201] redeem[^h1350] it.
###### 7
Now this was the manner in former time[^h6440] in Israel[^h3478] concerning redeeming[^h1353] and concerning changing[^h8545], for to confirm[^h6965] all things[^h1697]; a man[^h376] plucked off[^h8025] his shoe[^h5275], and gave[^h5414] it to his neighbour[^h7453]: and this was a testimony[^h8584] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
Therefore the kinsman[^h1350] said[^h559] unto Boaz[^h1162], Buy[^h7069] it for thee. So he drew off[^h8025] his shoe[^h5275].
###### 9
And Boaz[^h1162] said[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205], and unto all the people[^h5971], Ye are witnesses[^h5707] this day[^h3117], that I have bought[^h7069] all that was Elimelech's[^h458], and all that was Chilion's[^h3630] and Mahlon's[^h4248], of the hand[^h3027] of Naomi[^h5281].
###### 10
Moreover Ruth[^h7327] the Moabitess[^h4125], the wife[^h802] of Mahlon[^h4248], have I purchased[^h7069] to be my wife[^h802], to raise up[^h6965] the name[^h8034] of the dead[^h4191] upon his inheritance[^h5159], that the name[^h8034] of the dead[^h4191] be not cut off[^h3772] from among[^h5973] his brethren[^h251], and from the gate[^h8179] of his place[^h4725]: ye are witnesses[^h5707] this day[^h3117].
###### 11
And all the people[^h5971] that were in the gate[^h8179], and the elders[^h2205], said[^h559], We are witnesses[^h5707]. The LORD[^h3068] make[^h5414] the woman[^h802] that is come[^h935] into thine house[^h1004] like Rachel[^h7354] and like Leah[^h3812], which two[^h8147] did build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]: and do[^h6213] thou worthily[^h2428] in Ephratah[^h672], and be famous[^h7121] [^h8034] in Bethlehem[^h1035]:  
###### 12
And let thy house[^h1004] be like the house[^h1004] of Pharez[^h6557], whom Tamar[^h8559] bare[^h3205] unto Judah[^h3063], of the seed[^h2233] which the LORD[^h3068] shall give[^h5414] thee of this young woman[^h5291].
###### 13
So Boaz[^h1162] took[^h3947] Ruth[^h7327], and she was his wife[^h802]: and when he went in[^h935] unto her, the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] her conception[^h2032], and she bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121].
###### 14
And the women[^h802] said[^h559] unto Naomi[^h5281], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068], which hath not left[^h7673] thee this day[^h3117] without a kinsman[^h1350], that his name[^h8034] may be famous[^h7121] in Israel[^h3478].  
###### 15
And he shall be unto thee a restorer[^h7725] of thy life[^h5315], and a nourisher[^h3557] of thine old age[^h7872]: for thy daughter in law[^h3618], which loveth[^h157] thee, which is better[^h2896] to thee than seven[^h7651] sons[^h1121], hath born[^h3205] him.  
###### 16
And Naomi[^h5281] took[^h3947] the child[^h3206], and laid[^h7896] it in her bosom[^h2436], and became nurse[^h539] unto it.
###### 17
And the women her neighbours[^h7934] gave[^h7121] it a name[^h8034], saying[^h559], There is a son[^h1121] born[^h3205] to Naomi[^h5281]; and they called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Obed[^h5744]: he is the father[^h1] of Jesse[^h3448], the father[^h1] of David[^h1732].
###### 18
Now these are the generations[^h8435] of Pharez[^h6557]: Pharez[^h6557] begat[^h3205] Hezron[^h2696],
###### 19
And Hezron[^h2696] begat[^h3205] Ram[^h7410], and Ram[^h7410] begat[^h3205] Amminadab[^h5992],
###### 20
And Amminadab[^h5992] begat[^h3205] Nahshon[^h5177], and Nahshon[^h5177] begat[^h3205] Salmon[^h8009], 
###### 21
And Salmon[^h8012] begat[^h3205] Boaz[^h1162], and Boaz[^h1162] begat[^h3205] Obed[^h5744],
###### 22
And Obed[^h5744] begat[^h3205] Jesse[^h3448], and Jesse[^h3448] begat[^h3205] David[^h1732].

###### 1
Then Naomi[^h5281] her mother in law[^h2545] said[^h559] unto her, My daughter[^h1323], shall I not seek[^h1245] rest[^h4494] for thee, that it may be well[^h3190] with thee?
###### 2
And now is not Boaz[^h1162] of our kindred[^h4130], with whose maidens[^h5291] thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth[^h2219] barley[^h8184] to night[^h3915] in the threshingfloor[^h1637].
###### 3
Wash[^h7364] thyself therefore, and anoint[^h5480] thee, and put[^h7760] thy raiment[^h8071] upon thee, and get thee down[^h3381] to the floor[^h1637]: but make not thyself known[^h3045] unto the man[^h376], until he shall have done[^h3615] eating[^h398] and drinking[^h8354].
###### 4
And it shall be, when he lieth down[^h7901], that thou shalt mark[^h3045] the place[^h4725] where he shall lie[^h7901], and thou shalt go in[^h935], and uncover[^h1540] his feet[^h4772], and lay thee down[^h7901]; and he will tell[^h5046] thee what thou shalt do[^h6213]. 
###### 5
And she said[^h559] unto her, All that thou sayest[^h559] unto me I will do[^h6213].
###### 6
And she went down[^h3381] unto the floor[^h1637], and did[^h6213] according to all that her mother in law[^h2545] bade[^h6680] her.
###### 7
And when Boaz[^h1162] had eaten[^h398] and drunk[^h8354], and his heart[^h3820] was merry[^h3190], he went[^h935] to lie down[^h7901] at the end[^h7097] of the heap of corn[^h6194]: and she came[^h935] softly[^h3909], and uncovered[^h1540] his feet[^h4772], and laid her down[^h7901].
###### 8
And it came to pass at midnight[^h2677] [^h3915], that the man[^h376] was afraid[^h2729], and turned[^h3943] himself: and, behold, a woman[^h802] lay[^h7901] at his feet[^h4772]. 
###### 9
And he said[^h559], Who art thou? And she answered[^h559], I am Ruth[^h7327] thine handmaid[^h519]: spread[^h6566] therefore thy skirt[^h3671] over thine handmaid[^h519]; for thou art a near kinsman[^h1350]. 
###### 10
And he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be thou of the LORD[^h3068], my daughter[^h1323]: for thou hast shewed[^h3190] more kindness[^h2617] in the latter end[^h314] than at the beginning[^h7223], inasmuch as thou followedst[^h3212] [^h310] not[^h1115] young men[^h970], whether poor[^h1800] or rich[^h6223].
###### 11
And now, my daughter[^h1323], fear[^h3372] not; I will do[^h6213] to thee all that thou requirest[^h559]: for all the city[^h8179] of my people[^h5971] doth know[^h3045] that thou art a virtuous[^h2428] woman[^h802]. 
###### 12
And now it is true[^h551] that I am thy near kinsman[^h1350]: howbeit there is[^h3426] a kinsman[^h1350] nearer[^h7138] than I.
###### 13
Tarry[^h3885] this night[^h3915], and it shall be in the morning[^h1242], that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman[^h1350], well[^h2896]; let him do the kinsman's part[^h1350]: but if he will[^h2654] not do the part of a kinsman[^h1350] to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman[^h1350] to thee, as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416]: lie down[^h7901] until the morning[^h1242].
###### 14
And she lay[^h7901] at his feet[^h4772] until the morning[^h1242]: and she rose up[^h6965] before[^h2958] one[^h376] could know[^h5234] another[^h7453]. And he said[^h559], Let it not be known[^h3045] that a woman[^h802] came[^h935] into the floor[^h1637].
###### 15
Also he said[^h559], Bring[^h3051] the vail[^h4304] that thou hast upon thee, and hold[^h270] it. And when she held[^h270] it, he measured[^h4058] six[^h8337] measures of barley[^h8184], and laid[^h7896] it on her: and she went[^h935] into the city[^h5892]. 
###### 16
And when she came[^h935] to her mother in law[^h2545], she said[^h559], Who art thou, my daughter[^h1323]? And she told[^h5046] her all that the man[^h376] had done[^h6213] to her.
###### 17
And she said[^h559], These six[^h8337] measures of barley[^h8184] gave[^h5414] he me; for he said[^h559] to me, Go[^h935] not empty[^h7387] unto thy mother in law[^h2545].
###### 18
Then said[^h559] she, Sit still[^h3427], my daughter[^h1323], until thou know[^h3045] how the matter[^h1697] will fall[^h5307]: for the man[^h376] will not be in rest[^h8252], until[^h518] he have finished[^h3615] the thing[^h1697] this day[^h3117].

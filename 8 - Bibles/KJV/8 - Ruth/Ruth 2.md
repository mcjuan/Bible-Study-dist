###### 1
And Naomi[^h5281] had a kinsman[^h4129] [^h3045] of her husband's[^h376], a mighty[^h1368] man[^h376] of wealth[^h2428], of the family[^h4940] of Elimelech[^h458]; and his name[^h8034] was Boaz[^h1162]. 
###### 2
And Ruth[^h7327] the Moabitess[^h4125] said[^h559] unto Naomi[^h5281], Let me now go[^h3212] to the field[^h7704], and glean[^h3950] ears of corn[^h7641] after[^h310] him in whose sight[^h5869] I shall find[^h4672] grace[^h2580]. And she said[^h559] unto her, Go[^h3212], my daughter[^h1323].
###### 3
And she went[^h3212], and came[^h935], and gleaned[^h3950] in the field[^h7704] after[^h310] the reapers[^h7114]: and her hap[^h4745] was to light[^h7136] on a part[^h2513] of the field[^h7704] belonging unto Boaz[^h1162], who was of the kindred[^h4940] of Elimelech[^h458]. 
###### 4
And, behold, Boaz[^h1162] came[^h935] from Bethlehem[^h1035], and said[^h559] unto the reapers[^h7114], The LORD[^h3068] be with you. And they answered[^h559] him, The LORD[^h3068] bless[^h1288] thee.
###### 5
Then said[^h559] Boaz[^h1162] unto his servant[^h5288] that was set[^h5324] over the reapers[^h7114], Whose damsel[^h5291] is this?
###### 6
And the servant[^h5288] that was set[^h5324] over the reapers[^h7114] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], It is the Moabitish[^h4125] damsel[^h5291] that came back[^h7725] with Naomi[^h5281] out of the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124]:
###### 7
And she said[^h559], I pray you, let me glean[^h3950] and gather[^h622] after[^h310] the reapers[^h7114] among the sheaves[^h6016]: so she came[^h935], and hath continued[^h5975] even[^h227] from the morning[^h1242] until now, that she tarried[^h3427] a little[^h4592] in the house[^h1004].
###### 8
Then said[^h559] Boaz[^h1162] unto Ruth[^h7327], Hearest[^h8085] thou not, my daughter[^h1323]? Go[^h3212] not to glean[^h3950] in another[^h312] field[^h7704], neither go[^h5674] from hence, but abide[^h1692] here fast by my maidens[^h5291]:
###### 9
Let thine eyes[^h5869] be on the field[^h7704] that they do reap[^h7114], and go[^h1980] thou after[^h310] them: have I not charged[^h6680] the young men[^h5288] that they shall not touch[^h5060] thee? and when thou art athirst[^h6770], go[^h1980] unto the vessels[^h3627], and drink[^h8354] of that which the young men[^h5288] have drawn[^h7579].
###### 10
Then she fell[^h5307] on her face[^h6440], and bowed[^h7812] herself to the ground[^h776], and said[^h559] unto him, Why have I found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869], that thou shouldest take knowledge[^h5234] of me, seeing I am a stranger[^h5237]?
###### 11
And Boaz[^h1162] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto her, It hath fully[^h5046] been shewed[^h5046] me, all that thou hast done[^h6213] unto thy mother in law[^h2545] since[^h310] the death[^h4194] of thine husband[^h376]: and how thou hast left[^h5800] thy father[^h1] and thy mother[^h517], and the land[^h776] of thy nativity[^h4138], and art come[^h3212] unto a people[^h5971] which thou knewest[^h3045] not heretofore[^h8543] [^h8032].
###### 12
The LORD[^h3068] recompense[^h7999] thy work[^h6467], and a full[^h8003] reward[^h4909] be given thee of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], under whose wings[^h3671] thou art come[^h935] to trust[^h2620].
###### 13
Then she said[^h559], Let me find[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], my lord[^h113]; for that thou hast comforted[^h5162] me, and for that thou hast spoken[^h1696] friendly[^h3820] unto thine handmaid[^h8198], though I be not like unto one[^h259] of thine handmaidens[^h8198].  
###### 14
And Boaz[^h1162] said[^h559] unto her, At mealtime[^h6256] [^h400] come[^h5066] thou hither[^h1988], and eat[^h398] of the bread[^h3899], and dip[^h2881] thy morsel[^h6595] in the vinegar[^h2558]. And she sat[^h3427] beside[^h6654] the reapers[^h7114]: and he reached[^h6642] her parched[^h7039] corn, and she did eat[^h398], and was sufficed[^h7646], and left[^h3498].
###### 15
And when she was risen up[^h6965] to glean[^h3950], Boaz[^h1162] commanded[^h6680] his young men[^h5288], saying[^h559], Let her glean[^h3950] even among the sheaves[^h6016], and reproach[^h3637] her not: 
###### 16
And let fall[^h7997] also some of the handfuls[^h6653] of purpose[^h7997] for her, and leave[^h5800] them, that she may glean[^h3950] them, and rebuke[^h1605] her not.
###### 17
So she gleaned[^h3950] in the field[^h7704] until even[^h6153], and beat out[^h2251] that she had gleaned[^h3950]: and it was about an ephah[^h374] of barley[^h8184].
###### 18
And she took it up[^h5375], and went[^h935] into the city[^h5892]: and her mother in law[^h2545] saw[^h7200] what she had gleaned[^h3950]: and she brought forth[^h3318], and gave[^h5414] to her that she had reserved[^h3498] after she was sufficed[^h7648].
###### 19
And her mother in law[^h2545] said[^h559] unto her, Where hast thou gleaned[^h3950] to day[^h3117]? and where[^h375] wroughtest[^h6213] thou? blessed[^h1288] be he that did take knowledge[^h5234] of thee. And she shewed[^h5046] her mother in law[^h2545] with whom she had wrought[^h6213], and said[^h559], The man's[^h376] name[^h8034] with whom I wrought[^h6213] to day[^h3117] is Boaz[^h1162].
###### 20
And Naomi[^h5281] said[^h559] unto her daughter in law[^h3618], Blessed[^h1288] be he of the LORD[^h3068], who hath not left off[^h5800] his kindness[^h2617] to the living[^h2416] and to the dead[^h4191]. And Naomi[^h5281] said[^h559] unto her, The man[^h376] is near of kin[^h7138] unto us, one of our next kinsmen[^h1350]. 
###### 21
And Ruth[^h7327] the Moabitess[^h4125] said[^h559], He said[^h559] unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast[^h1692] by my young men[^h5288], until they have ended[^h3615] all my harvest[^h7105].
###### 22
And Naomi[^h5281] said[^h559] unto Ruth[^h7327] her daughter in law[^h3618], It is good[^h2896], my daughter[^h1323], that thou go out[^h3318] with his maidens[^h5291], that they meet[^h6293] thee not in any other[^h312] field[^h7704]. 
###### 23
So she kept fast[^h1692] by the maidens[^h5291] of Boaz[^h1162] to glean[^h3950] unto the end[^h3615] of barley[^h8184] harvest[^h7105] and of wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105]; and dwelt[^h3427] with her mother in law[^h2545].

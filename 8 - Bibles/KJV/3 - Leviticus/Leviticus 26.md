###### 1
Ye shall make[^h6213] you no idols[^h457] nor graven image[^h6459], neither rear you up[^h6965] a standing image[^h4676], neither shall ye set up[^h5414] any image[^h4906] of stone[^h68] in your land[^h776], to bow down[^h7812] unto it: for I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].  
###### 2
Ye shall keep[^h8104] my sabbaths[^h7676], and reverence[^h3372] my sanctuary[^h4720]: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
If ye walk[^h3212] in my statutes[^h2708], and keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687], and do[^h6213] them;
###### 4
Then I will give[^h5414] you rain[^h1653] in due season[^h6256], and the land[^h776] shall yield[^h5414] her increase[^h2981], and the trees[^h6086] of the field[^h7704] shall yield[^h5414] their fruit[^h6529].
###### 5
And your threshing[^h1786] shall reach[^h5381] unto the vintage[^h1210], and the vintage[^h1210] shall reach[^h5381] unto the sowing time[^h2233]: and ye shall eat[^h398] your bread[^h3899] to the full[^h7648], and dwell[^h3427] in your land[^h776] safely[^h983].
###### 6
And I will give[^h5414] peace[^h7965] in the land[^h776], and ye shall lie down[^h7901], and none shall make you afraid[^h2729]: and I will rid[^h7673] evil[^h7451] beasts[^h2416] out of the land[^h776], neither shall the sword[^h2719] go[^h5674] through your land[^h776]. 
###### 7
And ye shall chase[^h7291] your enemies[^h341], and they shall fall[^h5307] before[^h6440] you by the sword[^h2719].
###### 8
And five[^h2568] of you shall chase[^h7291] an hundred[^h3967], and an hundred[^h3967] of you shall put ten thousand[^h7233] to flight[^h7291]: and your enemies[^h341] shall fall[^h5307] before[^h6440] you by the sword[^h2719].
###### 9
For I will have respect[^h6437] unto you, and make you fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235] you, and establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] with you.
###### 10
And ye shall eat[^h398] old store[^h3462], and bring forth[^h3318] the old[^h3465] because[^h6440] of the new[^h2319].
###### 11
And I will set[^h5414] my tabernacle[^h4908] among[^h8432] you: and my soul[^h5315] shall not abhor[^h1602] you.
###### 12
And I will walk[^h1980] among[^h8432] you, and will be[^h1961] your God[^h430], and ye shall be[^h1961] my people[^h5971].
###### 13
I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which brought you forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], that ye should not be their bondmen[^h5650]; and I have broken[^h7665] the bands[^h4133] of your yoke[^h5923], and made you go[^h3212] upright[^h6968].
###### 14
But if ye will not hearken[^h8085] unto me, and will not do[^h6213] all these commandments[^h4687];
###### 15
And if ye shall despise[^h3988] my statutes[^h2708], or if your soul[^h5315] abhor[^h1602] my judgments[^h4941], so that ye will not do[^h6213] all my commandments[^h4687], but that ye break[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285]:
###### 16
I also will do[^h6213] this unto you; I will even appoint[^h6485] over you terror[^h928], consumption[^h7829], and the burning ague[^h6920], that shall consume[^h3615] the eyes[^h5869], and cause sorrow[^h1727] of heart[^h5315]: and ye shall sow[^h2232] your seed[^h2233] in vain[^h7385], for your enemies[^h341] shall eat[^h398] it. 
###### 17
And I will set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] against you, and ye shall be slain[^h5062] before[^h6440] your enemies[^h341]: they that hate[^h8130] you shall reign[^h7287] over you; and ye shall flee[^h5127] when none pursueth[^h7291] you.
###### 18
And if ye will not yet[^h5704] for all this hearken[^h8085] unto me, then I will punish[^h3256] you seven times[^h7651] more[^h3254] for your sins[^h2403].
###### 19
And I will break[^h7665] the pride[^h1347] of your power[^h5797]; and I will make[^h5414] your heaven[^h8064] as iron[^h1270], and your earth[^h776] as brass[^h5154]:
###### 20
And your strength[^h3581] shall be spent[^h8552] in vain[^h7385]: for your land[^h776] shall not yield[^h5414] her increase[^h2981], neither shall the trees[^h6086] of the land[^h776] yield[^h5414] their fruits[^h6529].
###### 21
And if ye walk[^h3212] contrary[^h7147] unto me, and will[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto me; I will bring[^h3254] seven times[^h7651] more[^h3254] plagues[^h4347] upon you according to your sins[^h2403]. 
###### 22
I will also send[^h7971] wild[^h7704] beasts[^h2416] among you, which shall rob you of your children[^h7921], and destroy[^h3772] your cattle[^h929], and make you few in number[^h4591]; and your high ways[^h1870] shall be desolate[^h8074].
###### 23
And if ye will not be reformed[^h3256] by me by these things, but will walk[^h1980] contrary[^h7147] unto me;
###### 24
Then will I also walk[^h1980] contrary[^h7147] unto you, and will punish[^h5221] you yet[^h1571] seven times[^h7651] for your sins[^h2403].
###### 25
And I will bring[^h935] a sword[^h2719] upon you, that shall avenge[^h5358] the quarrel[^h5359] of my covenant[^h1285]: and when ye are gathered together[^h622] within[^h413] your cities[^h5892], I will send[^h7971] the pestilence[^h1698] among[^h8432] you; and ye shall be delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the enemy[^h341].
###### 26
And when I have broken[^h7665] the staff[^h4294] of your bread[^h3899], ten[^h6235] women[^h802] shall bake[^h644] your bread[^h3899] in one[^h259] oven[^h8574], and they shall deliver[^h7725] you your bread[^h3899] again[^h7725] by weight[^h4948]: and ye shall eat[^h398], and not be satisfied[^h7646].
###### 27
And if ye will not for all this[^h2063] hearken[^h8085] unto me, but walk[^h1980] contrary[^h7147] unto me;
###### 28
Then I will walk[^h1980] contrary[^h7147] unto you also in fury[^h2534]; and I, even[^h637] I, will chastise[^h3256] you seven times[^h7651] for your sins[^h2403].
###### 29
And ye shall eat[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] of your sons[^h1121], and the flesh[^h1320] of your daughters[^h1323] shall ye eat[^h398].
###### 30
And I will destroy[^h8045] your high places[^h1116], and cut down[^h3772] your images[^h2553], and cast[^h5414] your carcases[^h6297] upon the carcases[^h6297] of your idols[^h1544], and my soul[^h5315] shall abhor[^h1602] you.
###### 31
And I will make[^h5414] your cities[^h5892] waste[^h2723], and bring[^h8074] your sanctuaries[^h4720] unto desolation[^h8074], and I will not smell[^h7306] the savour[^h7381] of your sweet odours[^h5207].
###### 32
And I will bring[^h8074] the land[^h776] into desolation[^h8074]: and your enemies[^h341] which dwell[^h3427] therein shall be astonished[^h8074] at it.
###### 33
And I will scatter[^h2219] you among the heathen[^h1471], and will draw out[^h7324] a sword[^h2719] after[^h310] you: and your land[^h776] shall be desolate[^h8077], and your cities[^h5892] waste[^h2723].
###### 34
Then shall the land[^h776] enjoy[^h7521] her sabbaths[^h7676], as long[^h3117] as it lieth desolate[^h8074], and ye be in your enemies'[^h341] land[^h776]; even then shall the land[^h776] rest[^h7673], and enjoy[^h7521] her sabbaths[^h7676].
###### 35
As long as[^h3117] it lieth desolate[^h8074] it shall rest[^h7673]; because it did not rest[^h7673] in your sabbaths[^h7676], when ye dwelt[^h3427] upon it.
###### 36
And upon them that are left[^h7604] alive of you I will send[^h935] a faintness[^h4816] into their hearts[^h3824] in the lands[^h776] of their enemies[^h341]; and the sound[^h6963] of a shaken[^h5086] leaf[^h5929] shall chase[^h7291] them; and they shall flee[^h5127], as fleeing[^h4499] from a sword[^h2719]; and they shall fall[^h5307] when none pursueth[^h7291]. 
###### 37
And they shall fall[^h3782] one[^h376] upon another[^h251], as it were before[^h6440] a sword[^h2719], when none pursueth[^h7291]: and ye shall have no power to stand[^h8617] before[^h6440] your enemies[^h341].
###### 38
And ye shall perish[^h6] among the heathen[^h1471], and the land[^h776] of your enemies[^h341] shall eat you up[^h398].
###### 39
And they that are left[^h7604] of you shall pine away[^h4743] in their iniquity[^h5771] in your enemies'[^h341] lands[^h776]; and also in the iniquities[^h5771] of their fathers[^h1] shall they pine away[^h4743] with them.
###### 40
If they shall confess[^h3034] their iniquity[^h5771], and the iniquity[^h5771] of their fathers[^h1], with their trespass[^h4604] which they trespassed[^h4603] against me, and that also they have walked[^h1980] contrary[^h7147] unto me;
###### 41
And that I also have walked[^h3212] contrary[^h7147] unto them, and have brought[^h935] them into the land[^h776] of their enemies[^h341]; if then[^h176] their uncircumcised[^h6189] hearts[^h3824] be humbled[^h3665], and they then accept[^h7521] of the punishment of their iniquity[^h5771]:
###### 42
Then will I remember[^h2142] my covenant[^h1285] with Jacob[^h3290], and also my covenant[^h1285] with Isaac[^h3327], and also my covenant[^h1285] with Abraham[^h85] will I remember[^h2142]; and I will remember[^h2142] the land[^h776].
###### 43
The land[^h776] also shall be left[^h5800] of them, and shall enjoy[^h7521] her sabbaths[^h7676], while she lieth desolate[^h8074] without them: and they shall accept[^h7521] of the punishment of their iniquity[^h5771]: because[^h3282], even because[^h3282] they despised[^h3988] my judgments[^h4941], and because their soul[^h5315] abhorred[^h1602] my statutes[^h2708].
###### 44
And yet[^h637] for all that[^h2063], when they be[^h1571] in the land[^h776] of their enemies[^h341], I will not cast them away[^h3988], neither will I abhor[^h1602] them, to destroy them utterly[^h3615], and to break[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285] with them: for I am the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].
###### 45
But I will for their sakes remember[^h2142] the covenant[^h1285] of their ancestors[^h7223], whom I brought forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] in the sight[^h5869] of the heathen[^h1471], that I might be their God[^h430]: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 46
These are the statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941] and laws[^h8451], which the LORD[^h3068] made[^h5414] between him and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].

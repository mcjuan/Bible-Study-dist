###### 1
And it came to pass on the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117], that Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121], and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478];
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] thee a young[^h1241] [^h1121] calf[^h5695] for a sin offering[^h2403], and a ram[^h352] for a burnt offering[^h5930], without blemish[^h8549], and offer[^h7126] them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] thou shalt speak[^h1696], saying[^h559], Take[^h3947] ye a kid[^h8163] of the goats[^h5795] for a sin offering[^h2403]; and a calf[^h5695] and a lamb[^h3532], both of the first[^h1121] year[^h8141], without blemish[^h8549], for a burnt offering[^h5930];
###### 4
Also a bullock[^h7794] and a ram[^h352] for peace offerings[^h8002], to sacrifice[^h2076] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and a meat offering[^h4503] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081]: for to day[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] will appear[^h7200] unto you.
###### 5
And they brought[^h3947] that which Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and all the congregation[^h5712] drew near[^h7126] and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], This is the thing[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] that ye should do[^h6213]: and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] shall appear[^h7200] unto you.
###### 7
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Go[^h7126] unto the altar[^h4196], and offer[^h6213] thy sin offering[^h2403], and thy burnt offering[^h5930], and make an atonement[^h3722] for thyself, and for the people[^h5971]: and offer[^h6213] the offering[^h7133] of the people[^h5971], and make an atonement[^h3722] for them; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680].
###### 8
Aaron[^h175] therefore went[^h7126] unto the altar[^h4196], and slew[^h7819] the calf[^h5695] of the sin offering[^h2403], which was for himself.
###### 9
And the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] brought[^h7126] the blood[^h1818] unto him: and he dipped[^h2881] his finger[^h676] in the blood[^h1818], and put[^h5414] it upon the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196], and poured[^h3332] out the blood[^h1818] at the bottom[^h3247] of the altar[^h4196]:
###### 10
But the fat[^h2459], and the kidneys[^h3629], and the caul[^h3508] above[^h4480] the liver[^h3516] of the sin offering[^h2403], he burnt[^h6999] upon the altar[^h4196]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 11
And the flesh[^h1320] and the hide[^h5785] he burnt[^h8313] with fire[^h784] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264].
###### 12
And he slew[^h7819] the burnt offering[^h5930]; and Aaron's[^h175] sons[^h1121] presented[^h4672] unto him the blood[^h1818], which he sprinkled[^h2236] round about[^h5439] upon the altar[^h4196].
###### 13
And they presented[^h4672] the burnt offering[^h5930] unto him, with the pieces[^h5409] thereof, and the head[^h7218]: and he burnt[^h6999] them upon the altar[^h4196].
###### 14
And he did wash[^h7364] the inwards[^h7130] and the legs[^h3767], and burnt[^h6999] them upon the burnt offering[^h5930] on the altar[^h4196].
###### 15
And he brought[^h7126] the people's[^h5971] offering[^h7133], and took[^h3947] the goat[^h8163], which was the sin offering[^h2403] for the people[^h5971], and slew[^h7819] it, and offered it for sin[^h2398], as the first[^h7223].
###### 16
And he brought[^h7126] the burnt offering[^h5930], and offered[^h6213] it according to the manner[^h4941]. 
###### 17
And he brought[^h7126] the meat offering[^h4503], and took[^h4390] an handful[^h3709] thereof, and burnt[^h6999] it upon the altar[^h4196], beside[^h905] the burnt sacrifice[^h5930] of the morning[^h1242]. 
###### 18
He slew[^h7819] also the bullock[^h7794] and the ram[^h352] for a sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002], which was for the people[^h5971]: and Aaron's[^h175] sons[^h1121] presented[^h4672] unto him the blood[^h1818], which he sprinkled[^h2236] upon the altar[^h4196] round about[^h5439],
###### 19
And the fat[^h2459] of the bullock[^h7794] and of the ram[^h352], the rump[^h451], and that which covereth[^h4374] the inwards, and the kidneys[^h3629], and the caul[^h3508] above the liver[^h3516]:
###### 20
And they put[^h7760] the fat[^h2459] upon the breasts[^h2373], and he burnt[^h6999] the fat[^h2459] upon the altar[^h4196]:
###### 21
And the breasts[^h2373] and the right[^h3225] shoulder[^h7785] Aaron[^h175] waved[^h5130] for a wave offering[^h8573] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; as Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680].
###### 22
And Aaron[^h175] lifted up[^h5375] his hand[^h3027] toward the people[^h5971], and blessed[^h1288] them, and came down[^h3381] from offering[^h6213] of the sin offering[^h2403], and the burnt offering[^h5930], and peace offerings[^h8002].
###### 23
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and came out[^h3318], and blessed[^h1288] the people[^h5971]: and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto all the people[^h5971].
###### 24
And there came[^h3318] a fire[^h784] out from before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and consumed[^h398] upon the altar[^h4196] the burnt offering[^h5930] and the fat[^h2459]: which when all the people[^h5971] saw[^h7200], they shouted[^h7442], and fell[^h5307] on their faces[^h6440].

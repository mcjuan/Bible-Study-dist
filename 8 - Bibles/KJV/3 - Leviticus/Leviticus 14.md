And the priest[^h3548] shall go forth[^h3318] out[^h2351] of the camp[^h4264]; and the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200], and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] be healed[^h7495] in the leper[^h6879];
###### 4

###### 21
And if he be poor[^h1800], and cannot get[^h3027] [^h5381] so much; then he shall take[^h3947] one[^h259] lamb[^h3532] for a trespass offering[^h817] to be waved[^h8573], to make an atonement[^h3722] for him, and one[^h259] tenth deal[^h6241] of fine flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081] for a meat offering[^h4503], and a log[^h3849] of oil[^h8081];

When ye be come[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], which I give[^h5414] to you for a possession[^h272], and I put[^h5414] the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] in a house[^h1004] of the land[^h776] of your possession[^h272];
###### 35
And he that owneth the house[^h1004] shall come[^h935] and tell[^h5046] the priest[^h3548], saying[^h559], It seemeth[^h7200] to me there is as it were a plague[^h5061] in the house[^h1004]:

###### 39
And the priest[^h3548] shall come again[^h7725] the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], and shall look[^h7200]: and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] be spread[^h6581] in the walls[^h7023] of the house[^h1004];
###### 40
Then the priest[^h3548] shall command[^h6680] that they take[^h2502] away the stones[^h68] in which[^h2004] the plague[^h5061] is, and they shall cast[^h7993] [^h853] them into an unclean[^h2931] place[^h4725] without[^h2351] the city[^h5892]:
###### 41
And he shall cause the house[^h1004] to be scraped[^h7106] within[^h1004] round about[^h5439], and they shall pour[^h8210] out the dust[^h6083] that they scrape[^h7096] off without[^h2351] the city[^h5892] into an unclean[^h2931] place[^h4725]:
###### 42
And they shall take[^h3947] other[^h312] stones[^h68], and put[^h935] them in the place[^h8478] of those stones[^h68]; and he shall take[^h3947] other[^h312] morter[^h6083], and shall plaister[^h2902] the house[^h1004].
###### 43

###### 44
Then the priest[^h3548] shall come[^h935] and look[^h7200], and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] be spread[^h6581] in the house[^h1004], it is a fretting[^h3992] leprosy[^h6883] in the house[^h1004]: it is unclean[^h2931].
###### 45
And he shall break down[^h5422] the house[^h1004], the stones[^h68] of it, and the timber[^h6086] thereof, and all the morter[^h6083] of the house[^h1004]; and he shall carry them forth[^h3318] out[^h2351] of the city[^h5892] into an unclean[^h2931] place[^h4725].
###### 46
Moreover he that goeth[^h935] into the house[^h1004] all the while[^h3117] that it is shut[^h5462] up shall be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153].

###### 49
And he shall take[^h3947] to cleanse[^h2398] the house[^h1004] two[^h8147] birds[^h6833], and cedar[^h730] wood[^h6086], and scarlet[^h8144] [^h8438], and hyssop[^h231]:

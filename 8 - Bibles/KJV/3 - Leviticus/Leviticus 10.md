###### 1
And Nadab[^h5070] and Abihu[^h30], the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], took[^h3947] either[^h376] of them his censer[^h4289], and put[^h5414] fire[^h784] therein[^h2004], and put[^h7760] incense[^h7004] thereon, and offered[^h7126] strange[^h2114] fire[^h784] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], which he commanded[^h6680] them not.
###### 2
And there went out[^h3318] fire[^h784] from the LORD[^h3068], and devoured[^h398] them, and they died[^h4191] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
Then Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], This is it that the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696], saying[^h559], I will be sanctified[^h6942] in them that come nigh[^h7138] me, and before[^h6440] all the people[^h5971] I will be glorified[^h3513]. And Aaron[^h175] held his peace[^h1826].
###### 4
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] Mishael[^h4332] and Elzaphan[^h469], the sons[^h1121] of Uzziel[^h5816] the uncle[^h1730] of Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559] unto them, Come near[^h7126], carry[^h5375] your brethren[^h251] from before[^h6440] the sanctuary[^h6944] out[^h2351] of the camp[^h4264].
###### 5
So they went near[^h7126], and carried[^h5375] them in their coats[^h3801] out[^h2351] of the camp[^h4264]; as Moses[^h4872] had said[^h1696].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], and unto Eleazar[^h499] and unto Ithamar[^h385], his sons[^h1121], Uncover[^h6544] not your heads[^h7218], neither rend[^h6533] your clothes[^h899]; lest ye die[^h4191], and lest wrath[^h7107] come upon all the people[^h5712]: but let your brethren[^h251], the whole house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], bewail[^h1058] the burning[^h8316] which the LORD[^h3068] hath kindled[^h8313].
###### 7
And ye shall not go out[^h3318] from the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], lest ye die[^h4191]: for the anointing[^h4888] oil[^h8081] of the LORD[^h3068] is upon you. And they did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559],
###### 9
Do not drink[^h8354] wine[^h3196] nor strong drink[^h7941], thou, nor thy sons[^h1121] with thee, when ye go[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], lest ye die[^h4191]: it shall be a statute[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] throughout your generations[^h1755]:
###### 10
And that ye may put difference[^h914] between holy[^h6944] and unholy[^h2455], and between unclean[^h2931] and clean[^h2889];
###### 11
And that ye may teach[^h3384] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] all the statutes[^h2706] which the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] unto them by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 12
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], and unto Eleazar[^h499] and unto Ithamar[^h385], his sons[^h1121] that were left[^h3498], Take[^h3947] the meat offering[^h4503] that remaineth[^h3498] of the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801], and eat[^h398] it without leaven[^h4682] beside[^h681] the altar[^h4196]: for it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944]:
###### 13
And ye shall eat[^h398] it in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725], because it is thy due[^h2706], and thy sons'[^h1121] due[^h2706], of the sacrifices[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801]: for so I am commanded[^h6680].
###### 14
And the wave[^h8573] breast[^h2373] and heave[^h8641] shoulder[^h7785] shall ye eat[^h398] in a clean[^h2889] place[^h4725]; thou, and thy sons[^h1121], and thy daughters[^h1323] with thee: for they be thy due[^h2706], and thy sons'[^h1121] due[^h2706], which are given[^h5414] out of the sacrifices[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 15
The heave[^h8641] shoulder[^h7785] and the wave[^h8573] breast[^h2373] shall they bring[^h935] with the offerings made by fire[^h801] of the fat[^h2459], to wave[^h5130] it for a wave offering[^h8573] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'[^h1121] with thee, by a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769]; as the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680].
###### 16
And Moses[^h4872] diligently[^h1875] sought[^h1875] the goat[^h8163] of the sin offering[^h2403], and, behold, it was burnt[^h8313]: and he was angry[^h7107] with Eleazar[^h499] and Ithamar[^h385], the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] which were left[^h3498] alive, saying[^h559],
###### 17
Wherefore have ye not eaten[^h398] the sin offering[^h2403] in the holy[^h6944] place[^h4725], seeing it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944], and God hath given[^h5414] it you to bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of the congregation[^h5712], to make atonement[^h3722] for them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 18
Behold[^h2005], the blood[^h1818] of it was not brought[^h935] in within[^h6441] the holy[^h6944] place: ye should indeed[^h398] have eaten[^h398] it in the holy[^h6944] place, as I commanded[^h6680].
###### 19
And Aaron[^h175] said[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], Behold, this day[^h3117] have they offered[^h7126] their sin offering[^h2403] and their burnt offering[^h5930] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and such things have befallen[^h7122] me: and if I had eaten[^h398] the sin offering[^h2403] to day[^h3117], should it have been accepted[^h3190] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 20
And when Moses[^h4872] heard[^h8085] that, he was content[^h3190] [^h5869].

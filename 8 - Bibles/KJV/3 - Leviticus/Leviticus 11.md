###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] and to Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559] unto them,
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], These[^h2063] are the beasts[^h2416] which ye shall eat[^h398] among all the beasts[^h929] that are on the earth[^h776].
###### 3
Whatsoever parteth[^h6536] the hoof[^h6541], and is clovenfooted[^h8156] [^h8157], and cheweth[^h5927] the cud[^h1625], among the beasts[^h929], that shall ye eat[^h398].
###### 4
Nevertheless[^h389] these shall ye not eat[^h398] of them that chew[^h5927] the cud[^h1625], or of them that divide[^h6536] the hoof[^h6541]: as the camel[^h1581], because he cheweth[^h5927] the cud[^h1625], but divideth[^h6536] not the hoof[^h6541]; he is unclean[^h2931] unto you.
###### 5
And the coney[^h8227], because he cheweth[^h5927] the cud[^h1625], but divideth[^h6536] not the hoof[^h6541]; he is unclean[^h2931] unto you.
###### 6
And the hare[^h768], because he cheweth[^h5927] the cud[^h1625], but divideth[^h6536] not the hoof[^h6541]; he is unclean[^h2931] unto you.
###### 7
And the swine[^h2386], though he divide[^h6536] the hoof[^h6541], and be clovenfooted[^h8156] [^h8157], yet he cheweth[^h1641] not the cud[^h1625]; he is unclean[^h2931] to you.
###### 8
Of their flesh[^h1320] shall ye not eat[^h398], and their carcase[^h5038] shall ye not touch[^h5060]; they are unclean[^h2931] to you.
###### 9
These shall ye eat[^h398] of all that are in the waters[^h4325]: whatsoever hath fins[^h5579] and scales[^h7193] in the waters[^h4325], in the seas[^h3220], and in the rivers[^h5158], them shall ye eat[^h398].
###### 10
And all that have not fins[^h5579] and scales[^h7193] in the seas[^h3220], and in the rivers[^h5158], of all that move[^h8318] in the waters[^h4325], and of any living[^h2416] thing[^h5315] which is in the waters[^h4325], they shall be an abomination[^h8263] unto you:
###### 11
They shall be even an abomination[^h8263] unto you; ye shall not eat[^h398] of their flesh[^h1320], but ye shall have their carcases[^h5038] in abomination[^h8262].
###### 12
Whatsoever hath no fins[^h5579] nor scales[^h7193] in the waters[^h4325], that shall be an abomination[^h8263] unto you.
###### 13
And these are they which ye shall have in abomination[^h8262] among[^h4480] the fowls[^h5775]; they shall not be eaten[^h398], they are an abomination[^h8263]: the eagle[^h5404], and the ossifrage[^h6538], and the ospray[^h5822],
###### 14
And the vulture[^h1676], and the kite[^h344] after his kind[^h4327];
###### 15
Every raven[^h6158] after his kind[^h4327];
###### 16
And the owl[^h1323] [^h3284], and the night hawk[^h8464], and the cuckow[^h7828], and the hawk[^h5322] after his kind[^h4327],
###### 17
And the little owl[^h3563], and the cormorant[^h7994], and the great owl[^h3244],
###### 18

And the stork[^h2624], the heron[^h601] after her kind[^h4327], and the lapwing[^h1744], and the bat[^h5847].
###### 20
All fowls[^h5775] that creep[^h8318], going[^h1980] upon all four[^h702], shall be an abomination[^h8263] unto you.
###### 21
Yet these may ye eat[^h398] of every flying[^h5775] creeping[^h8318] thing that goeth[^h1980] upon all four[^h702], which have legs[^h3767] above[^h4605] their feet[^h7272], to leap[^h5425] withal[^h2004] upon the earth[^h776];
###### 22
Even these of them ye may eat[^h398]; the locust[^h697] after his kind[^h4327], and the bald locust[^h5556] after his kind[^h4327], and the beetle[^h2728] after his kind[^h4327], and the grasshopper[^h2284] after his kind[^h4327].
###### 23
But all other flying[^h5775] creeping things[^h8318], which have four[^h702] feet[^h7272], shall be an abomination[^h8263] unto you.
###### 24
And for these ye shall be unclean[^h2930]: whosoever toucheth[^h5060] the carcase[^h5038] of them shall be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153].
###### 25
And whosoever beareth[^h5375] ought of the carcase[^h5038] of them shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153].
###### 26

###### 27
And whatsoever[^h3605] [^h1992] goeth[^h1980] upon his paws[^h3709], among all manner of beasts[^h2416] that go[^h1980] on all four[^h702], those are unclean[^h2931] unto you: whoso toucheth[^h5060] their carcase[^h5038] shall be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153].
###### 28
And he that beareth[^h5375] the carcase[^h5038] of them shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153]: they are unclean[^h2931] unto you.

And the ferret[^h604], and the chameleon[^h3581], and the lizard[^h3911], and the snail[^h2546], and the mole[^h8580].
###### 31
These are unclean[^h2931] to you among all that creep[^h8318]: whosoever doth touch[^h5060] them, when they be dead[^h4194], shall be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153].
###### 32
And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead[^h4194], doth fall[^h5307], it shall be unclean[^h2930]; whether it be any vessel[^h3627] of wood[^h6086], or raiment[^h899], or skin[^h5785], or sack[^h8242], whatsoever vessel[^h3627] it be, wherein any work[^h4399] is done[^h6213], it must be put[^h935] into water[^h4325], and it shall be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153]; so it shall be cleansed[^h2891].
###### 33
And every earthen[^h2789] vessel[^h3627], whereinto any of them falleth[^h5307] [^h8432], whatsoever is in it shall be unclean[^h2930]; and ye shall break[^h7665] it.
###### 34

###### 36
Nevertheless a fountain[^h4599] or pit[^h953], wherein there is plenty[^h4723] of water[^h4325], shall be clean[^h2889]: but that which toucheth[^h5060] their carcase[^h5038] shall be unclean[^h2930]. 
###### 37
And if any part of their carcase[^h5038] fall[^h5307] upon any sowing[^h2221] seed[^h2233] which is to be sown[^h2232], it shall be clean[^h2889].
###### 38
But if any water[^h4325] be put[^h5414] upon the seed[^h2233], and any part of their carcase[^h5038] fall[^h5307] thereon, it shall be unclean[^h2931] unto you.

Whatsoever goeth[^h1980] upon the belly[^h1512], and whatsoever goeth[^h1980] upon all four[^h702], or whatsoever hath more[^h7235] feet[^h7272] among all creeping things[^h8318] that creep[^h8317] upon the earth[^h776], them ye shall not eat[^h398]; for they are an abomination[^h8263]. 
###### 43
Ye shall not make[^h8262] yourselves[^h5315] abominable[^h8262] with any creeping thing[^h8318] that creepeth[^h8317], neither shall ye make yourselves unclean[^h2933] with them, that ye should be defiled[^h2930] thereby. 
###### 44
For I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves[^h6942], and ye shall be holy[^h6918]; for I am holy[^h6918]: neither shall ye defile[^h2930] yourselves[^h5315] with any manner of creeping thing[^h8318] that creepeth[^h7430] upon the earth[^h776].
###### 45
For I am the LORD[^h3068] that bringeth[^h5927] you up out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], to be your God[^h430]: ye shall therefore be holy[^h6918], for I am holy[^h6918].

###### 47

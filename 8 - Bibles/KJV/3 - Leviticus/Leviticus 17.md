###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], and unto his sons[^h1121], and unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them; This is the thing[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680], saying[^h559],
###### 3
What[^h376] man[^h376] soever there be of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], that killeth[^h7819] an ox[^h7794], or lamb[^h3775], or goat[^h5795], in the camp[^h4264], or that killeth[^h7819] it out[^h2351] of the camp[^h4264],
###### 4
And bringeth[^h935] it not unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], to offer[^h7126] an offering[^h7133] unto the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068]; blood[^h1818] shall be imputed[^h2803] unto that man[^h376]; he hath shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]; and that man[^h376] shall be cut off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971]:
###### 5
To the end that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] may bring[^h935] their sacrifices[^h2077], which they offer[^h2076] in the open[^h6440] field[^h7704], even that they may bring[^h935] them unto the LORD[^h3068], unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], unto the priest[^h3548], and offer[^h2076] them for peace[^h8002] offerings[^h2077] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And the priest[^h3548] shall sprinkle[^h2236] the blood[^h1818] upon the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and burn[^h6999] the fat[^h2459] for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
And they shall no more offer[^h2076] their sacrifices[^h2077] unto devils[^h8163], after[^h310] whom they have gone a whoring[^h2181]. This shall be a statute[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] unto them throughout their generations[^h1755].
###### 8
And thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, Whatsoever man[^h376] there be of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], or of the strangers[^h1616] which sojourn[^h1481] among[^h8432] you, that offereth[^h5927] a burnt offering[^h5930] or sacrifice[^h2077],
###### 9
And bringeth[^h935] it not unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], to offer[^h6213] it unto the LORD[^h3068]; even that man[^h376] shall be cut off[^h3772] from among his people[^h5971].
###### 10
And whatsoever man[^h376] there be of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], or of the strangers[^h1616] that sojourn[^h1481] among[^h8432] you, that eateth[^h398] any manner of blood[^h1818]; I will even set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] against that soul[^h5315] that eateth[^h398] blood[^h1818], and will cut him off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971].
###### 11
For the life[^h5315] of the flesh[^h1320] is in the blood[^h1818]: and I have given[^h5414] it to you upon the altar[^h4196] to make an atonement[^h3722] for your souls[^h5315]: for it is the blood[^h1818] that maketh an atonement[^h3722] for the soul[^h5315].
###### 12
Therefore I said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], No soul[^h5315] of you shall eat[^h398] blood[^h1818], neither shall any stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] among[^h8432] you eat[^h398] blood[^h1818].
###### 13
And whatsoever man[^h376] there be of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], or of the strangers[^h1616] that sojourn[^h1481] among[^h8432] you, which hunteth[^h6679] and catcheth[^h6718] any beast[^h2416] or fowl[^h5775] that may be eaten[^h398]; he shall even pour[^h8210] out the blood[^h1818] thereof, and cover[^h3680] it with dust[^h6083]. 
###### 14
For it is the life[^h5315] of all flesh[^h1320]; the blood[^h1818] of it is for the life[^h5315] thereof: therefore I said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Ye shall eat[^h398] the blood[^h1818] of no manner of flesh[^h1320]: for the life[^h5315] of all flesh[^h1320] is the blood[^h1818] thereof: whosoever eateth[^h398] it shall be cut off[^h3772].
###### 15
And every soul[^h5315] that eateth[^h398] that which died[^h5038] of itself, or that which was torn[^h2966] with beasts, whether it be one of your own country[^h249], or a stranger[^h1616], he shall both wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and bathe[^h7364] himself in water[^h4325], and be unclean[^h2930] until the even[^h6153]: then shall he be clean[^h2891]. 
###### 16
But if he wash[^h3526] them not, nor bathe[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320]; then he shall bear[^h5375] his iniquity[^h5771].

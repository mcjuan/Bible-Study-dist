###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Again, thou shalt say[^h559] to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Whosoever[^h376] he be of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], or of the strangers[^h1616] that sojourn[^h1481] in Israel[^h3478], that giveth[^h5414] any of his seed[^h2233] unto Molech[^h4432]; he shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]: the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] shall stone[^h7275] him with stones[^h68].
###### 3
And I will set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] against that man[^h376], and will cut him off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971]; because he hath given[^h5414] of his seed[^h2233] unto Molech[^h4432], to defile[^h2930] my sanctuary[^h4720], and to profane[^h2490] my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034].
###### 4
And if the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] do any ways[^h5956] hide[^h5956] their eyes[^h5869] from the man[^h376], when he giveth[^h5414] of his seed[^h2233] unto Molech[^h4432], and kill[^h4191] him not[^h1115]:
###### 5
Then I will set[^h7760] my face[^h6440] against that man[^h376], and against his family[^h4940], and will cut him off[^h3772], and all that go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] him, to commit whoredom[^h2181] with Molech[^h4432], from among[^h7130] their people[^h5971].
###### 6
And the soul[^h5315] that turneth[^h6437] after[^h413] such as have familiar spirits[^h178], and after[^h310] wizards[^h3049], to go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] them, I will even set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] against that soul[^h5315], and will cut him off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971].
###### 7
Sanctify[^h6942] yourselves therefore, and be ye holy[^h6918]: for I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 8
And ye shall keep[^h8104] my statutes[^h2708], and do[^h6213] them: I am the LORD[^h3068] which sanctify[^h6942] you.
###### 9
For every[^h376] one[^h376] that curseth[^h7043] his father[^h1] or his mother[^h517] shall be surely[^h4191] put to death[^h4191]: he hath cursed[^h7043] his father[^h1] or his mother[^h517]; his blood[^h1818] shall be upon him.
###### 10
And the man[^h376] that committeth adultery[^h5003] with another man's[^h376] wife[^h802], even he that committeth adultery[^h5003] with his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802], the adulterer[^h5003] and the adulteress[^h5003] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 11
And the man[^h376] that lieth[^h7901] with his father's[^h1] wife[^h802] hath uncovered[^h1540] his father's[^h1] nakedness[^h6172]: both[^h8147] of them shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]; their blood[^h1818] shall be upon them.
###### 12
And if a man[^h376] lie[^h7901] with his daughter in law[^h3618], both[^h8147] of them shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]: they have wrought[^h6213] confusion[^h8397]; their blood[^h1818] shall be upon them.
###### 13
If a man[^h376] also lie[^h7901] with mankind[^h2145], as he lieth[^h4904] with a woman[^h802], both[^h8147] of them have committed[^h6213] an abomination[^h8441]: they shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]; their blood[^h1818] shall be upon them.
###### 14
And if a man[^h376] take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] and her mother[^h517], it is wickedness[^h2154]: they shall be burnt[^h8313] with fire[^h784], both he and they; that there be no wickedness[^h2154] among[^h8432] you.
###### 15
And if a man[^h376] lie[^h5414] [^h7903] with a beast[^h929], he shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]: and ye shall slay[^h2026] the beast[^h929].
###### 16
And if a woman[^h802] approach[^h7126] unto any beast[^h929], and lie down[^h7250] thereto, thou shalt kill[^h2026] the woman[^h802], and the beast[^h929]: they shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]; their blood[^h1818] shall be upon them.
###### 17
And if a man[^h376] shall take[^h3947] his sister[^h269], his father's[^h1] daughter[^h1323], or[^h176] his mother's[^h517] daughter[^h1323], and see[^h7200] her nakedness[^h6172], and she see[^h7200] his nakedness[^h6172]; it is a wicked thing[^h2617]; and they shall be cut off[^h3772] in the sight[^h5869] of their people[^h5971] [^h1121]: he hath uncovered[^h1540] his sister's[^h269] nakedness[^h6172]; he shall bear[^h5375] his iniquity[^h5771].
###### 18
And if a man[^h376] shall lie[^h7901] with a woman[^h802] having her sickness[^h1739], and shall uncover[^h1540] her nakedness[^h6172]; he hath discovered[^h6168] her fountain[^h4726], and she hath uncovered[^h1540] the fountain[^h4726] of her blood[^h1818]: and both[^h8147] of them shall be cut off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] their people[^h5971]. 
###### 19
And thou shalt not uncover[^h1540] the nakedness[^h6172] of thy mother's[^h517] sister[^h269], nor of thy father's[^h1] sister[^h269]: for he uncovereth[^h6168] his near kin[^h7607]: they shall bear[^h5375] their iniquity[^h5771]. 
###### 20
And if a man[^h376] shall lie[^h7901] with his uncle's wife[^h1733], he hath uncovered[^h1540] his uncle's[^h1730] nakedness[^h6172]: they shall bear[^h5375] their sin[^h2399]; they shall die[^h4191] childless[^h6185].
###### 21
And if a man[^h376] shall take[^h3947] his brother's[^h251] wife[^h802], it is an unclean thing[^h5079]: he hath uncovered[^h1540] his brother's[^h251] nakedness[^h6172]; they shall be childless[^h6185]. 
###### 22
Ye shall therefore keep[^h8104] all my statutes[^h2708], and all my judgments[^h4941], and do[^h6213] them: that the land[^h776], whither I bring[^h935] you to dwell[^h3427] therein, spue you not out[^h6958].
###### 23
And ye shall not walk[^h3212] in the manners[^h2708] of the nation[^h1471], which I cast out[^h7971] before[^h6440] you: for they committed[^h6213] all these things, and therefore I abhorred[^h6973] them.
###### 24
But I have said[^h559] unto you, Ye shall inherit[^h3423] their land[^h127], and I will give[^h5414] it unto you to possess[^h3423] it, a land[^h776] that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706]: I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which have separated[^h914] you from other people[^h5971].
###### 25
Ye shall therefore put difference[^h914] between clean[^h2889] beasts[^h929] and unclean[^h2931], and between unclean[^h2931] fowls[^h5775] and clean[^h2889]: and ye shall not make your souls[^h5315] abominable[^h8262] by beast[^h929], or by fowl[^h5775], or by any manner of living thing that creepeth[^h7430] on the ground[^h127], which I have separated[^h914] from you as unclean[^h2930]. 
###### 26
And ye shall be holy[^h6918] unto me: for I the LORD[^h3068] am holy[^h6918], and have severed[^h914] you from other people[^h5971], that ye should be mine.
###### 27
A man[^h376] also or woman[^h802] that hath[^h3588] a familiar spirit[^h178], or that is a wizard[^h3049], shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]: they shall stone[^h7275] them with stones[^h68]: their blood[^h1818] shall be upon them.

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Speak[^h559] unto the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], and say[^h559] unto them, There shall none be defiled[^h2930] for the dead[^h5315] among his people[^h5971]:
###### 2
But for his kin[^h7607], that is near[^h7138] unto him, that is, for his mother[^h517], and for his father[^h1], and for his son[^h1121], and for his daughter[^h1323], and for his brother[^h251],
###### 3
And for his sister[^h269] a virgin[^h1330], that is nigh[^h7138] unto him, which hath had no husband[^h376]; for her may he be defiled[^h2930].
###### 4
But he shall not defile[^h2930] himself, being a chief man[^h1167] among his people[^h5971], to profane[^h2490] himself. 
###### 5
They shall not make[^h7139] baldness[^h7144] upon their head[^h7218], neither shall they shave off[^h1548] the corner[^h6285] of their beard[^h2206], nor make[^h8295] any cuttings[^h8296] in their flesh[^h1320].
###### 6
They shall be holy[^h6944] unto their God[^h430], and not profane[^h2490] the name[^h8034] of their God[^h430]: for the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801], and the bread[^h3899] of their God[^h430], they do offer[^h7126]: therefore they shall be holy[^h6918].
###### 7
They shall not take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] that is a whore[^h2181], or profane[^h2491]; neither shall they take[^h3947] a woman[^h802] put away[^h1644] from her husband[^h376]: for he is holy[^h6918] unto his God[^h430].
###### 8
Thou shalt sanctify[^h6942] him therefore; for he offereth[^h7126] the bread[^h3899] of thy God[^h430]: he shall be holy[^h6918] unto thee: for I the LORD[^h3068], which sanctify[^h6942] you, am holy[^h6918].
###### 9
And the daughter[^h1323] of any[^h376] priest[^h3548], if she profane[^h2490] herself by playing the whore[^h2181], she profaneth[^h2490] her father[^h1]: she shall be burnt[^h8313] with fire[^h784].
###### 10
And he that is the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548] among his brethren[^h251], upon whose head[^h7218] the anointing[^h4888] oil[^h8081] was poured[^h3332], and that is consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] to put[^h3847] on the garments[^h899], shall not uncover[^h6544] his head[^h7218], nor rend[^h6533] his clothes[^h899];
###### 11
Neither shall he go in[^h935] to any dead[^h4191] body[^h5315], nor defile[^h2930] himself for his father[^h1], or for his mother[^h517];
###### 12
Neither shall he go out[^h3318] of the sanctuary[^h4720], nor profane[^h2490] the sanctuary[^h4720] of his God[^h430]; for the crown[^h5145] of the anointing[^h4888] oil[^h8081] of his God[^h430] is upon him: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And he shall take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] in her virginity[^h1331].
###### 14
A widow[^h490], or a divorced woman[^h1644], or profane[^h2491], or an harlot[^h2181], these shall he not take[^h3947]: but he shall take[^h3947] a virgin[^h1330] of his own people[^h5971] to wife[^h802].
###### 15
Neither shall he profane[^h2490] his seed[^h2233] among his people[^h5971]: for I the LORD[^h3068] do sanctify[^h6942] him.
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 17
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559], Whosoever[^h376] he be of thy seed[^h2233] in their generations[^h1755] that hath any blemish[^h3971], let him not approach[^h7126] to offer[^h7126] the bread[^h3899] of his God[^h430]. 
###### 18
For whatsoever man[^h376] he be that hath a blemish[^h3971], he shall not approach[^h7126]: a blind[^h5787] man[^h376], or a lame[^h6455], or he that hath a flat nose[^h2763], or any thing superfluous[^h8311],
###### 19
Or a man[^h376] that is brokenfooted[^h7667] [^h7272], or brokenhanded[^h7667] [^h3027],
###### 20
Or crookbackt[^h1384], or a dwarf[^h1851], or that hath a blemish[^h8400] in his eye[^h5869], or be scurvy[^h1618], or scabbed[^h3217], or hath his stones[^h810] broken[^h4790]; 
###### 21
No man[^h376] that hath a blemish[^h3971] of the seed[^h2233] of Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548] shall come nigh[^h5066] to offer[^h7126] the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801]: he hath a blemish[^h3971]; he shall not come nigh[^h5066] to offer[^h7126] the bread[^h3899] of his God[^h430].
###### 22
He shall eat[^h398] the bread[^h3899] of his God[^h430], both of the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944], and of the holy[^h6944].
###### 23
Only he shall not go in[^h935] unto the vail[^h6532], nor come nigh[^h5066] unto the altar[^h4196], because he hath a blemish[^h3971]; that he profane[^h2490] not my sanctuaries[^h4720]: for I the LORD[^h3068] do sanctify[^h6942] them.
###### 24
And Moses[^h4872] told[^h1696] it unto Aaron[^h175], and to his sons[^h1121], and unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].

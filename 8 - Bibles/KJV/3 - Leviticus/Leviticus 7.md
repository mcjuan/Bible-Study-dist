###### 5
And the priest[^h3548] shall burn[^h6999] them upon the altar[^h4196] for an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068]: it is a trespass offering[^h817].
###### 6
Every male[^h2145] among the priests[^h3548] shall eat[^h398] thereof: it shall be eaten[^h398] in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725]: it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944].
###### 7
As the sin offering[^h2403] is, so is the trespass offering[^h817]: there is one[^h259] law[^h8451] for them: the priest[^h3548] that maketh atonement[^h3722] therewith shall have it.

###### 11
And this is the law[^h8451] of the sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002], which he shall offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 12
If he offer[^h7126] it for a thanksgiving[^h8426], then he shall offer[^h7126] with the sacrifice[^h2077] of thanksgiving[^h8426] unleavened[^h4682] cakes[^h2471] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081], and unleavened[^h4682] wafers[^h7550] anointed[^h4886] with oil[^h8081], and cakes[^h2471] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081], of fine flour[^h5560], fried[^h7246].

###### 15
And the flesh[^h1320] of the sacrifice[^h2077] of his peace offerings[^h8002] for thanksgiving[^h8426] shall be eaten[^h398] the same day[^h3117] that it is offered[^h7133]; he shall not leave[^h3240] any of it until the morning[^h1242].
###### 16
But if the sacrifice[^h2077] of his offering[^h7133] be a vow[^h5088], or a voluntary offering[^h5071], it shall be eaten[^h398] the same day[^h3117] that he offereth[^h7126] his sacrifice[^h2077]: and on the morrow[^h4283] also the remainder[^h3498] of it shall be eaten[^h398]:
###### 17

###### 19
And the flesh[^h1320] that toucheth[^h5060] any unclean[^h2931] thing shall not be eaten[^h398]; it shall be burnt[^h8313] with fire[^h784]: and as for the flesh[^h1320], all that be clean[^h2889] shall eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 20
But the soul[^h5315] that eateth[^h398] of the flesh[^h1320] of the sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002], that pertain unto the LORD[^h3068], having his uncleanness[^h2932] upon him, even that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from his people[^h5971].
###### 21
Moreover the soul[^h5315] that shall touch[^h5060] any unclean[^h2932] thing, as the uncleanness[^h2932] of man[^h120], or any unclean[^h2931] beast[^h929], or any abominable[^h8263] unclean[^h2931] thing, and eat[^h398] of the flesh[^h1320] of the sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002], which pertain unto the LORD[^h3068], even that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from his people[^h5971].

###### 25
For whosoever eateth[^h398] the fat[^h2459] of the beast[^h929], of which men offer[^h7126] an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068], even the soul[^h5315] that eateth[^h398] it shall be cut off[^h3772] from his people[^h5971].
###### 26
Moreover ye shall eat[^h398] no manner of blood[^h1818], whether it be of fowl[^h5775] or of beast[^h929], in any of your dwellings[^h4186].
###### 27
Whatsoever soul[^h5315] it be that eateth[^h398] any manner[^h3605] of blood[^h1818], even that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from his people[^h5971].

###### 31

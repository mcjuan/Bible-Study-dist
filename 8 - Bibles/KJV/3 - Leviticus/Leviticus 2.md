###### 1
And when any[^h5315] will offer[^h7126] a meat[^h4503] offering[^h7133] unto the LORD[^h3068], his offering[^h7133] shall be of fine flour[^h5560]; and he shall pour[^h3332] oil[^h8081] upon it, and put[^h5414] frankincense[^h3828] thereon:
###### 2
And he shall bring[^h935] it to Aaron's[^h175] sons[^h1121] the priests[^h3548]: and he shall take[^h7061] thereout[^h8033] his handful[^h7062] [^h4393] of the flour[^h5560] thereof, and of the oil[^h8081] thereof, with all the frankincense[^h3828] thereof; and the priest[^h3548] shall burn[^h6999] the memorial[^h234] of it upon the altar[^h4196], to be an offering made by fire[^h801], of a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 3
And the remnant[^h3498] of the meat offering[^h4503] shall be Aaron's[^h175] and his sons'[^h1121]: it is a thing most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] of the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801].
###### 4
And if thou bring[^h7126] an oblation[^h7133] of a meat offering[^h4503] baken[^h3989] in the oven[^h8574], it shall be unleavened[^h4682] cakes[^h2471] of fine flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081], or unleavened[^h4682] wafers[^h7550] anointed[^h4886] with oil[^h8081].
###### 5
And if thy oblation[^h7133] be a meat offering[^h4503] baken in a pan[^h4227], it shall be of fine flour[^h5560] unleavened[^h4682], mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081]. 
###### 6
Thou shalt part[^h6626] it in pieces[^h6595], and pour[^h3332] oil[^h8081] thereon: it is a meat offering[^h4503].
###### 7
And if thy oblation[^h7133] be a meat offering[^h4503] baken in the fryingpan[^h4802], it shall be made[^h6213] of fine flour[^h5560] with oil[^h8081].
###### 8
And thou shalt bring[^h935] the meat offering[^h4503] that is made[^h6213] of these things unto the LORD[^h3068]: and when it is presented[^h7126] unto the priest[^h3548], he shall bring[^h5066] it unto the altar[^h4196].
###### 9
And the priest[^h3548] shall take[^h7311] from the meat offering[^h4503] a memorial[^h234] thereof, and shall burn[^h6999] it upon the altar[^h4196]: it is an offering made by fire[^h801], of a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
And that which is left[^h3498] of the meat offering[^h4503] shall be Aaron's[^h175] and his sons'[^h1121]: it is a thing most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] of the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801].
###### 11
No meat offering[^h4503], which ye shall bring[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068], shall be made[^h6213] with leaven[^h2557]: for ye shall burn[^h6999] no leaven[^h7603], nor any honey[^h1706], in any offering[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801].
###### 12
As for the oblation[^h7133] of the firstfruits[^h7225], ye shall offer[^h7126] them unto the LORD[^h3068]: but they shall not be burnt[^h5927] on the altar[^h4196] for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381]. 
###### 13
And every oblation[^h7133] of thy meat offering[^h4503] shalt thou season[^h4414] with salt[^h4417]; neither shalt thou suffer the salt[^h4417] of the covenant[^h1285] of thy God[^h430] to be lacking[^h7673] from thy meat offering[^h4503]: with all thine offerings[^h7133] thou shalt offer[^h7126] salt[^h4417].
###### 14
And if thou offer[^h7126] a meat offering[^h4503] of thy firstfruits[^h1061] unto the LORD[^h3068], thou shalt offer[^h7126] for the meat offering[^h4503] of thy firstfruits[^h1061] green ears[^h24] of corn dried[^h7033] by the fire[^h784], even corn beaten[^h1643] out of full ears[^h3759].
###### 15
And thou shalt put[^h5414] oil[^h8081] upon it, and lay[^h7760] frankincense[^h3828] thereon: it is a meat offering[^h4503].
###### 16
And the priest[^h3548] shall burn[^h6999] the memorial[^h234] of it, part of the beaten corn[^h1643] thereof, and part of the oil[^h8081] thereof, with all the frankincense[^h3828] thereof: it is an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068].

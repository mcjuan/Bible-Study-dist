###### 9
And it shall be Aaron's[^h175] and his sons'[^h1121]; and they shall eat[^h398] it in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725]: for it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] unto him of the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801] by a perpetual[^h5769] statute[^h2706].

###### 15
And thou shalt speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Whosoever[^h376] curseth[^h3588] [^h7043] his God[^h430] shall bear[^h5375] his sin[^h2399].
###### 16
And he that blasphemeth[^h5344] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], he shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191], and all the congregation[^h5712] shall certainly[^h7275] stone[^h7275] him: as well the stranger[^h1616], as he that is born in the land[^h249], when he blasphemeth[^h5344] the name[^h8034] of the LORD, shall be put to death[^h4191].
###### 17
And he[^h376] that killeth[^h5221] any[^h5315] man[^h120] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].

And he that killeth[^h5221] a beast[^h5315] [^h929] shall make it good[^h7999]; beast[^h5315] for beast[^h5315]. 
###### 19
And if a man[^h376] cause[^h5414] a blemish[^h3971] in his neighbour[^h5997]; as he hath done[^h6213], so shall it be done[^h6213] to him;
###### 20
Breach[^h7667] for breach[^h7667], eye[^h5869] for eye[^h5869], tooth[^h8127] for tooth[^h8127]: as he hath caused[^h5414] a blemish[^h3971] in a man[^h120], so shall it be done[^h5414] to him again.
###### 21
And he that killeth[^h5221] a beast[^h929], he shall restore[^h7999] it: and he that killeth[^h5221] a man[^h120], he shall be put to death[^h4191].
###### 22
Ye shall have one[^h259] manner of law[^h4941], as well for the stranger[^h1616], as for one of your own country[^h249]: for I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 23
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they should bring forth[^h3318] him that had cursed[^h7043] out[^h2351] of the camp[^h4264], and stone[^h7275] him with stones[^h68]. And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].

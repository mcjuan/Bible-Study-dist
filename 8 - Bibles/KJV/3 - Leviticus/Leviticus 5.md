###### 1
And if a soul[^h5315] sin[^h2398], and hear[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of swearing[^h423], and is a witness[^h5707], whether[^h176] he hath seen[^h7200] or known[^h3045] of it; if he do not utter[^h5046] it, then he shall bear[^h5375] his iniquity[^h5771].
###### 2
Or if a soul[^h5315] touch[^h5060] any unclean[^h2931] thing[^h1697], whether it be a carcase[^h5038] of an unclean[^h2931] beast[^h2416], or a carcase[^h5038] of unclean[^h2931] cattle[^h929], or the carcase[^h5038] of unclean[^h2931] creeping things[^h8318], and if it be hidden[^h5956] from him; he also shall be unclean[^h2931], and guilty[^h816].
###### 3
Or if he touch[^h5060] the uncleanness[^h2932] of man[^h120], whatsoever uncleanness[^h2932] it be that a man shall be defiled[^h2930] withal, and it be hid[^h5956] from him; when he knoweth[^h3045] of it, then he shall be guilty[^h816].
###### 4
Or if a soul[^h5315] swear[^h7650], pronouncing[^h981] with his lips[^h8193] to do evil[^h7489], or to do good[^h3190], whatsoever it be that a man[^h120] shall pronounce[^h981] with an oath[^h7621], and it be hid[^h5956] from him; when he knoweth[^h3045] of it, then he shall be guilty[^h816] in one[^h259] of these.
###### 5
And it shall be, when he shall be guilty[^h816] in one[^h259] of these things, that he shall confess[^h3034] that he hath sinned[^h2398] in that thing:
###### 6
And he shall bring[^h935] his trespass offering[^h817] unto the LORD[^h3068] for his sin[^h2403] which he hath sinned[^h2398], a female[^h5347] from the flock[^h6629], a lamb[^h3776] or a kid[^h8166] of the goats[^h5795], for a sin offering[^h2403]; and the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him concerning his sin[^h2403].
###### 7
And if he[^h3027] be not able[^h1767] to bring[^h5060] a lamb[^h7716], then he shall bring[^h935] for[^h854] his trespass[^h817], which he hath committed[^h2398], two[^h8147] turtledoves[^h8449], or two[^h8147] young[^h1121] pigeons[^h3123], unto the LORD[^h3068]; one[^h259] for a sin offering[^h2403], and the other[^h259] for a burnt offering[^h5930]. 
###### 8
And he shall bring[^h935] them unto the priest[^h3548], who shall offer[^h7126] that which is for the sin offering[^h2403] first[^h7223], and wring off[^h4454] his head[^h7218] from[^h4136] his neck[^h6203], but shall not divide it asunder[^h914]:
###### 9
And he shall sprinkle[^h5137] of the blood[^h1818] of the sin offering[^h2403] upon the side[^h7023] of the altar[^h4196]; and the rest[^h7604] of the blood[^h1818] shall be wrung out[^h4680] at the bottom[^h3247] of the altar[^h4196]: it is a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 10
And he shall offer[^h6213] the second[^h8145] for a burnt offering[^h5930], according to the manner[^h4941]: and the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him for his sin[^h2403] which he hath sinned[^h2398], and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him. 
###### 11
But if he[^h3027] be not able to bring[^h5381] two[^h8147] turtledoves[^h8449], or two[^h8147] young[^h1121] pigeons[^h3123], then he that sinned[^h2398] shall bring[^h935] for his offering[^h7133] the tenth[^h6224] part of an ephah[^h374] of fine flour[^h5560] for a sin offering[^h2403]; he shall put[^h7760] no oil[^h8081] upon it, neither shall he put[^h5414] any frankincense[^h3828] thereon: for it is a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 12
Then shall he bring[^h935] it to the priest[^h3548], and the priest[^h3548] shall take[^h7061] his handful[^h4393] [^h7062] of it, even a memorial[^h234] thereof, and burn[^h6999] it on the altar[^h4196], according to the offerings made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068]: it is a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 13
And the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him as touching his sin[^h2403] that he hath sinned[^h2398] in one[^h259] of these, and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him: and the remnant shall be the priest's[^h3548], as a meat offering[^h4503].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 15
If a soul[^h5315] commit[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604], and sin[^h2398] through ignorance[^h7684], in the holy things[^h6944] of the LORD[^h3068]; then he shall bring[^h935] for his trespass[^h817] unto the LORD[^h3068] a ram[^h352] without blemish[^h8549] out of the flocks[^h6629], with thy estimation[^h6187] by shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701], after the shekel[^h8255] of the sanctuary[^h6944], for a trespass offering[^h817]:
###### 16
And he shall make amends[^h7999] for the harm[^h2398] that he hath done in the holy thing[^h6944], and shall add[^h3254] the fifth part[^h2549] thereto, and give[^h5414] it unto the priest[^h3548]: and the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him with the ram[^h352] of the trespass offering[^h817], and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him.
###### 17
And if a soul[^h5315] sin[^h2398], and commit[^h6213] any[^h259] of these things which are forbidden to be done[^h6213] by the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068]; though he wist[^h3045] it not, yet is he guilty[^h816], and shall bear[^h5375] his iniquity[^h5771].
###### 18
And he shall bring[^h935] a ram[^h352] without blemish[^h8549] out of the flock[^h6629], with thy estimation[^h6187], for a trespass offering[^h817], unto the priest[^h3548]: and the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him concerning his ignorance[^h7684] wherein he erred[^h7683] and wist[^h3045] it not, and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him.
###### 19
It is a trespass offering[^h817]: he hath certainly[^h816] trespassed[^h816] against the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175] and to his sons[^h1121], that they separate[^h5144] themselves from the holy things[^h6944] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and that they profane[^h2490] not my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034] in those things which they hallow[^h6942] unto me: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
Say[^h559] unto them, Whosoever[^h376] he be of all your seed[^h2233] among your generations[^h1755], that goeth[^h7126] unto the holy things[^h6944], which the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] hallow[^h6942] unto the LORD[^h3068], having his uncleanness[^h2932] upon him, that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from my presence[^h6440]: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
What man soever[^h376] of the seed[^h2233] of Aaron[^h175] is a leper[^h6879], or hath a running issue[^h2100]; he shall not eat[^h398] of the holy things[^h6944], until he be clean[^h2891]. And whoso toucheth[^h5060] any thing that is unclean[^h2931] by the dead[^h5315], or a man[^h376] whose seed[^h2233] [^h7902] goeth[^h3318] from him; 
###### 5
Or whosoever[^h376] toucheth[^h5060] any creeping thing[^h8318], whereby he may be made unclean[^h2930], or a man[^h120] of whom he may take uncleanness[^h2930], whatsoever uncleanness[^h2932] he hath;
###### 6
The soul[^h5315] which hath touched[^h5060] any such shall be unclean[^h2930] until even[^h6153], and shall not eat[^h398] of the holy things[^h6944], unless[^h518] he wash[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320] with water[^h4325].
###### 7
And when the sun[^h8121] is down[^h935], he shall be clean[^h2891], and shall afterward[^h310] eat[^h398] of the holy things[^h6944]; because it is his food[^h3899].
###### 8
That which dieth of itself[^h5038], or is torn[^h2966] with beasts, he shall not eat[^h398] to defile[^h2930] himself therewith: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
They shall therefore keep[^h8104] mine ordinance[^h4931], lest they bear[^h5375] sin[^h2399] for it, and die[^h4191] therefore, if they profane[^h2490] it: I the LORD[^h3068] do sanctify[^h6942] them.
###### 10
There shall no stranger[^h2114] eat[^h398] of the holy thing[^h6944]: a sojourner[^h8453] of the priest[^h3548], or an hired servant[^h7916], shall not eat[^h398] of the holy thing[^h6944].
###### 11
But if the priest[^h3548] buy[^h7069] any soul[^h5315] with[^h7075] his money[^h3701], he shall eat[^h398] of it, and he that is born[^h3211] in his house[^h1004]: they shall eat[^h398] of his meat[^h3899]. 
###### 12
If the priest's[^h3548] daughter[^h1323] also be married unto a stranger[^h376] [^h2114], she may not eat[^h398] of an offering[^h8641] of the holy things[^h6944]. 
###### 13
But if the priest's[^h3548] daughter[^h1323] be a widow[^h490], or divorced[^h1644], and have no child[^h2233], and is returned[^h7725] unto her father's[^h1] house[^h1004], as in her youth[^h5271], she shall eat[^h398] of her father's[^h1] meat[^h3899]: but there shall no stranger[^h2114] eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 14
And if a man[^h376] eat[^h398] of the holy thing[^h6944] unwittingly[^h7684], then he shall put[^h3254] the fifth[^h2549] part thereof unto it, and shall give[^h5414] it unto the priest[^h3548] with the holy thing[^h6944].
###### 15
And they shall not profane[^h2490] the holy things[^h6944] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which they offer[^h7311] unto the LORD[^h3068];
###### 16
Or suffer them to bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of trespass[^h819], when they eat[^h398] their holy things[^h6944]: for I the LORD[^h3068] do sanctify[^h6942] them. 
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 18
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], and to his sons[^h1121], and unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, Whatsoever[^h376] he be of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], or of the strangers[^h1616] in Israel[^h3478], that will offer[^h7126] his oblation[^h7133] for all his vows[^h5088], and for all his freewill offerings[^h5071], which they will offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068] for a burnt offering[^h5930];
###### 19
Ye shall offer at your own will[^h7522] a male[^h2145] without blemish[^h8549], of the beeves[^h1241], of the sheep[^h3775], or of the goats[^h5795].
###### 20
But whatsoever hath a blemish[^h3971], that shall ye not offer[^h7126]: for it shall not be acceptable[^h7522] for you.
###### 21
And whosoever[^h376] offereth[^h7126] a sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002] unto the LORD[^h3068] to accomplish[^h6381] his vow[^h5088], or a freewill offering[^h5071] in beeves[^h1241] or sheep[^h6629], it shall be perfect[^h8549] to be accepted[^h7522]; there shall be no blemish[^h3971] therein. 
###### 22
Blind[^h5788], or broken[^h7665], or maimed[^h2782], or having a wen[^h2990], or scurvy[^h1618], or scabbed[^h3217], ye shall not offer[^h7126] these unto the LORD[^h3068], nor make[^h5414] an offering by fire[^h801] of them upon the altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
Either a bullock[^h7794] or a lamb[^h7716] that hath any thing superfluous[^h8311] or lacking in his parts[^h7038], that mayest thou offer[^h6213] for a freewill offering[^h5071]; but for a vow[^h5088] it shall not be accepted[^h7521]. 
###### 24
Ye shall not offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068] that which is bruised[^h4600], or crushed[^h3807], or broken[^h5423], or cut[^h3772]; neither shall ye make[^h6213] any offering thereof in your land[^h776].
###### 25
Neither from a stranger's[^h5236] hand[^h3027] [^h1121] shall ye offer[^h7126] the bread[^h3899] of your God[^h430] of any of these; because their corruption[^h4893] is in them, and blemishes[^h3971] be in them: they shall not be accepted[^h7521] for you.
###### 26
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 27
When a bullock[^h7794], or a sheep[^h3775], or a goat[^h5795], is brought forth[^h3205], then it shall be seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] under the dam[^h517]; and from the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117] and thenceforth[^h1973] it shall be accepted[^h7521] for an offering[^h7133] made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 28
And whether it be cow[^h7794] or ewe[^h7716], ye shall not kill[^h7819] it and her young[^h1121] both in one[^h259] day[^h3117]. 
###### 29
And when ye will offer[^h2076] a sacrifice[^h2077] of thanksgiving[^h8426] unto the LORD[^h3068], offer[^h2076] it at your own will[^h7522].
###### 30
On the same day[^h3117] it shall be eaten up[^h398]; ye shall leave[^h3498] none of it until the morrow[^h1242]: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 31
Therefore shall ye keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687], and do[^h6213] them: I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 32
Neither shall ye profane[^h2490] my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034]; but I will be hallowed[^h6942] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: I am the LORD[^h3068] which hallow[^h6942] you,
###### 33
That brought you out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], to be your God[^h430]: I am the LORD[^h3068].

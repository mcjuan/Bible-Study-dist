###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559],
###### 2
When a man[^h120] shall have in the skin[^h5785] of his flesh[^h1320] a rising[^h7613], a scab[^h5597], or bright spot[^h934], and it be in the skin[^h5785] of his flesh[^h1320] like the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883]; then he shall be brought[^h935] unto Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548], or unto one[^h259] of his sons[^h1121] the priests[^h3548]: 
###### 3
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on the plague[^h5061] in the skin[^h5785] of the flesh[^h1320]: and when the hair[^h8181] in the plague[^h5061] is turned[^h2015] white[^h3836], and the plague[^h5061] in sight[^h4758] be deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785] of his flesh[^h1320], it is a plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883]: and the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on him, and pronounce him unclean[^h2930].
###### 4
If the bright spot[^h934] be white[^h3836] in the skin[^h5785] of his flesh[^h1320], and in sight[^h4758] be not deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785], and the hair[^h8181] thereof be not turned[^h2015] white[^h3836]; then the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] up him that hath the plague[^h5061] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]:
###### 5
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on him the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117]: and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] in his sight[^h5869] be at a stay[^h5975], and the plague[^h5061] spread[^h6581] not in the skin[^h5785]; then the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] him up seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] more[^h8145]:
###### 6
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on him again[^h8145] the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117]: and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] be somewhat dark[^h3544], and the plague[^h5061] spread[^h6581] not in the skin[^h5785], the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891]: it is but a scab[^h4556]: and he shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and be clean[^h2891].
###### 7
But if the scab[^h4556] spread much[^h6581] abroad[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], after[^h310] that he hath been seen[^h7200] of the priest[^h3548] for his cleansing[^h2893], he shall be seen[^h7200] of the priest[^h3548] again[^h8145]:
###### 8
And if the priest[^h3548] see[^h7200] that, behold, the scab[^h4556] spreadeth[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is a leprosy[^h6883].
###### 9
When the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] is in a man[^h120], then he shall be brought[^h935] unto the priest[^h3548];
###### 10
And the priest[^h3548] shall see[^h7200] him: and, behold, if the rising[^h7613] be white[^h3836] in the skin[^h5785], and it have turned[^h2015] the hair[^h8181] white[^h3836], and there be quick[^h4241] raw[^h2416] flesh[^h1320] in the rising[^h7613]; 
###### 11
It is an old[^h3462] leprosy[^h6883] in the skin[^h5785] of his flesh[^h1320], and the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930], and shall not shut[^h5462] him up: for he is unclean[^h2931].
###### 12
And if a leprosy[^h6883] break out[^h6524] abroad[^h6524] in the skin[^h5785], and the leprosy[^h6883] cover[^h3680] all the skin[^h5785] of him that hath the plague[^h5061] from his head[^h7218] even to his foot[^h7272], wheresoever the priest[^h3548] looketh[^h4758] [^h5869];
###### 13
Then the priest[^h3548] shall consider[^h7200]: and, behold, if the leprosy[^h6883] have covered[^h3680] all his flesh[^h1320], he shall pronounce him clean[^h2891] that hath the plague[^h5061]: it is all turned[^h2015] white[^h3836]: he is clean[^h2889].
###### 14
But when[^h3117] raw[^h2416] flesh[^h1320] appeareth[^h7200] in him, he shall be unclean[^h2930].
###### 15
And the priest[^h3548] shall see[^h7200] the raw[^h2416] flesh[^h1320], and pronounce him to be unclean[^h2930]: for the raw[^h2416] flesh[^h1320] is unclean[^h2931]: it is a leprosy[^h6883].
###### 16
Or if the raw[^h2416] flesh[^h1320] turn again[^h7725], and be changed[^h2015] unto white[^h3836], he shall come[^h935] unto the priest[^h3548];
###### 17
And the priest[^h3548] shall see[^h7200] him: and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] be turned[^h2015] into white[^h3836]; then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891] that hath the plague[^h5061]: he is clean[^h2889].
###### 18
The flesh[^h1320] also, in which[^h3588], even in the skin[^h5785] thereof, was a boil[^h7822], and is healed[^h7495],
###### 19
And in the place[^h4725] of the boil[^h7822] there be a white[^h3836] rising[^h7613], or a bright spot[^h934], white[^h3836], and somewhat reddish[^h125], and it be shewed[^h7200] to the priest[^h3548];
###### 20
And if, when the priest[^h3548] seeth[^h7200] it, behold, it be in sight[^h4758] lower[^h8217] than the skin[^h5785], and the hair[^h8181] thereof be turned[^h2015] white[^h3836]; the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is a plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] broken[^h6524] out of the boil[^h7822].
###### 21
But if the priest[^h3548] look[^h7200] on it, and, behold, there be no white[^h3836] hairs[^h8181] therein, and if it be not lower[^h8217] than the skin[^h5785], but be somewhat dark[^h3544]; then the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] him up seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]:
###### 22
And if it spread much[^h6581] abroad[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is a plague[^h5061].
###### 23
But if the bright spot[^h934] stay[^h5975] in his place, and spread[^h6581] not, it is a burning[^h6867] boil[^h7822]; and the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891].
###### 24
Or if there be any flesh[^h1320], in the skin[^h5785] whereof there is a hot[^h784] burning[^h4348], and the quick[^h4241] flesh that burneth[^h4348] have a white[^h3836] bright spot[^h934], somewhat reddish[^h125], or white[^h3836]; 
###### 25
Then the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] upon it: and, behold, if the hair[^h8181] in the bright spot[^h934] be turned[^h2015] white[^h3836], and it be in sight[^h4758] deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785]; it is a leprosy[^h6883] broken[^h6524] out of the burning[^h4348]: wherefore the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883].
###### 26
But if the priest[^h3548] look[^h7200] on it, and, behold, there be no white[^h3836] hair[^h8181] in the bright spot[^h934], and it be no lower[^h8217] than the other skin[^h5785], but be somewhat dark[^h3544]; then the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] him up seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]:
###### 27
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] upon him the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117]: and if it be spread much[^h6581] abroad[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883].
###### 28
And if the bright[^h934] spot[^h934] stay[^h5975] in his place, and spread[^h6581] not in the skin[^h5785], but it be somewhat dark[^h3544]; it is a rising[^h7613] of the burning[^h4348], and the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891]: for it is an inflammation[^h6867] of the burning[^h4348].
###### 29
If a man[^h376] or woman[^h802] have a plague[^h5061] upon the head[^h7218] or the beard[^h2206];
###### 30
Then the priest[^h3548] shall see[^h7200] the plague[^h5061]: and, behold, if it be in sight[^h4758] deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785]; and there be in it a yellow[^h6669] thin[^h1851] hair[^h8181]; then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him unclean[^h2930]: it is a dry scall[^h5424], even a leprosy[^h6883] upon the head[^h7218] or beard[^h2206].
###### 31
And if the priest[^h3548] look[^h7200] on the plague[^h5061] of the scall[^h5424], and, behold, it be not in sight[^h4758] deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785], and that there is no black[^h7838] hair[^h8181] in it; then the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] up him that hath the plague[^h5061] of the scall[^h5424] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]:
###### 32
And in the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on the plague[^h5061]: and, behold, if the scall[^h5424] spread[^h6581] not, and there be in it no yellow[^h6669] hair[^h8181], and the scall[^h5424] be not in sight[^h4758] deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785];
###### 33
He shall be shaven[^h1548], but the scall[^h5424] shall he not shave[^h1548]; and the priest[^h3548] shall shut[^h5462] up him that hath the scall[^h5424] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] more[^h8145]:
###### 34
And in the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on the scall[^h5424]: and, behold, if the scall[^h5424] be not spread[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], nor be in sight[^h4758] deeper[^h6013] than the skin[^h5785]; then the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891]: and he shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and be clean[^h2891].
###### 35
But if the scall[^h5424] spread[^h6581] much[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785] after[^h310] his cleansing[^h2893];
###### 36
Then the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on him: and, behold, if the scall[^h5424] be spread[^h6581] in the skin[^h5785], the priest[^h3548] shall not seek[^h1239] for yellow[^h6669] hair[^h8181]; he is unclean[^h2931].
###### 37
But if the scall[^h5424] be in his sight[^h5869] at a stay[^h5975], and that there is black[^h7838] hair[^h8181] grown[^h6779] up therein; the scall[^h5424] is healed[^h7495], he is clean[^h2889]: and the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him clean[^h2891].
###### 38
If a man[^h376] also or a woman[^h802] have in the skin[^h5785] of their flesh[^h1320] bright spots[^h934], even white[^h3836] bright spots[^h934];
###### 39
Then the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200]: and, behold, if the bright spots[^h934] in the skin[^h5785] of their flesh[^h1320] be darkish[^h3544] white[^h3836]; it is a freckled spot[^h933] that groweth[^h6524] in the skin[^h5785]; he is clean[^h2889].
###### 40
And the man[^h376] [^h3588] whose hair is fallen[^h4803] off his head[^h7218], he is bald[^h7142]; yet is he clean[^h2889]. 
###### 41
And he that hath his hair fallen[^h4803] off from the part[^h6285] of his head[^h7218] toward his face[^h6440], he is forehead bald[^h1371]: yet is he clean[^h2889].
###### 42
And if there be in the bald head[^h7146], or bald forehead[^h1372], a white[^h3836] reddish[^h125] sore[^h5061]; it is a leprosy[^h6883] sprung[^h6524] up in his bald head[^h7146], or his bald forehead[^h1372].
###### 43
Then the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] upon it: and, behold, if the rising[^h7613] of the sore[^h5061] be white[^h3836] reddish[^h125] in his bald head[^h7146], or in his bald forehead[^h1372], as the leprosy[^h6883] appeareth[^h4758] in the skin[^h5785] of the flesh[^h1320];
###### 44
He is a leprous[^h6879] man[^h376], he is unclean[^h2931]: the priest[^h3548] shall pronounce him utterly[^h2930] unclean[^h2930]; his plague[^h5061] is in his head[^h7218].
###### 45
And the leper[^h6879] in whom the plague[^h5061] is, his clothes[^h899] shall be rent[^h6533], and his head[^h7218] bare[^h6544], and he shall put a covering[^h5844] upon his upper lip[^h8222], and shall cry[^h7121], Unclean[^h2931], unclean[^h2931].
###### 46
All the days[^h3117] wherein the plague[^h5061] shall be in him he shall be defiled[^h2930]; he is unclean[^h2931]: he shall dwell[^h3427] alone[^h910]; without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264] shall his habitation[^h4186] be.
###### 47
The garment[^h899] also that the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] is in, whether it be a woollen[^h6785] garment[^h899], or a linen[^h6593] garment[^h899];
###### 48
Whether it be in the warp[^h8359], or woof[^h6154]; of linen[^h6593], or of woollen[^h6785]; whether in a skin[^h5785], or in any thing made[^h4399] of skin[^h5785]; 
###### 49
And if the plague[^h5061] be greenish[^h3422] or reddish[^h125] in the garment[^h899], or in the skin[^h5785], either[^h176] in the warp[^h8359], or in the woof[^h6154], or in any thing[^h3627] of skin[^h5785]; it is a plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883], and shall be shewed[^h7200] unto the priest[^h3548]: 
###### 50
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] upon the plague[^h5061], and shut[^h5462] up it that hath the plague[^h5061] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]:
###### 51
And he shall look[^h7200] on the plague[^h5061] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117]: if the plague[^h5061] be spread[^h6581] in the garment[^h899], either in the warp[^h8359], or in the woof[^h6154], or in a skin[^h5785], or in any work[^h4399] that is made[^h6213] of skin[^h5785]; the plague[^h5061] is a fretting[^h3992] leprosy[^h6883]; it is unclean[^h2931].
###### 52
He shall therefore burn[^h8313] that garment[^h899], whether warp[^h8359] or woof[^h6154], in woollen[^h6785] or in linen[^h6593], or any thing[^h3627] of skin[^h5785], wherein the plague[^h5061] is: for it is a fretting[^h3992] leprosy[^h6883]; it shall be burnt[^h8313] in the fire[^h784].
###### 53
And if the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200], and, behold, the plague[^h5061] be not spread[^h6581] in the garment[^h899], either[^h176] in the warp[^h8359], or[^h176] in the woof[^h6154], or[^h176] in any thing[^h3627] of skin[^h5785];
###### 54
Then the priest[^h3548] shall command[^h6680] that they wash[^h3526] the thing wherein the plague[^h5061] is, and he shall shut[^h5462] it up seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] more[^h8145]:
###### 55
And the priest[^h3548] shall look[^h7200] on the plague[^h5061], after[^h310] that it is washed[^h3526]: and, behold, if the plague[^h5061] have not changed[^h2015] his colour[^h5869], and the plague[^h5061] be not spread[^h6581]; it is unclean[^h2931]; thou shalt burn[^h8313] it in the fire[^h784]; it is fret[^h6356] inward, whether it be bare within[^h7146] or without[^h1372]. 
###### 56
And if the priest[^h3548] look[^h7200], and, behold, the plague[^h5061] be somewhat dark[^h3544] after[^h310] the washing[^h3526] of it; then he shall rend[^h7167] it out of the garment[^h899], or out of the skin[^h5785], or out of the warp[^h8359], or out of the woof[^h6154]:
###### 57
And if it appear[^h7200] still[^h5750] in the garment[^h899], either in the warp[^h8359], or in the woof[^h6154], or in any thing[^h3627] of skin[^h5785]; it is a spreading[^h6524] plague: thou shalt burn[^h8313] that wherein the plague[^h5061] is with fire[^h784].
###### 58
And the garment[^h899], either warp[^h8359], or woof[^h6154], or whatsoever thing[^h3627] of skin[^h5785] it be, which thou shalt wash[^h3526], if the plague[^h5061] be departed[^h5493] from them, then it shall be washed[^h3526] the second[^h8145] time, and shall be clean[^h2891].
###### 59
This is the law[^h8451] of the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883] in a garment[^h899] of woollen[^h6785] or linen[^h6593], either in the warp[^h8359], or woof[^h6154], or any thing[^h3627] of skins[^h5785], to pronounce it clean[^h2891], or to pronounce it unclean[^h2930].

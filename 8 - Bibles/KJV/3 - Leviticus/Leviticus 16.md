###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of the two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], when they offered[^h7126] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and died[^h4191];
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251], that he come[^h935] not at all times[^h6256] into the holy[^h6944] place within[^h1004] the vail[^h6532] before[^h6440] the mercy seat[^h3727], which is upon the ark[^h727]; that he die[^h4191] not: for I will appear[^h7200] in the cloud[^h6051] upon the mercy[^h3727] seat.
###### 3
Thus[^h2063] shall Aaron[^h175] come[^h935] into the holy[^h6944] place: with a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] for a sin offering[^h2403], and a ram[^h352] for a burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 4
He shall put on[^h3847] the holy[^h6944] linen[^h906] coat[^h3801], and he shall have the linen[^h906] breeches[^h4370] upon his flesh[^h1320], and shall be girded[^h2296] with a linen[^h906] girdle[^h73], and with the linen[^h906] mitre[^h4701] shall he be attired[^h6801]: these[^h1992] are holy[^h6944] garments[^h899]; therefore shall he wash[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320] in water[^h4325], and so put them on[^h3847].
###### 5
And he shall take[^h3947] of the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] two[^h8147] kids[^h8163] of the goats[^h5795] for a sin offering[^h2403], and one[^h259] ram[^h352] for a burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 6
And Aaron[^h175] shall offer[^h7126] his bullock[^h6499] of the sin offering[^h2403], which is for himself[^h1157], and make an atonement[^h3722] for himself, and for his house[^h1004].
###### 7
And he shall take[^h3947] the two[^h8147] goats[^h8163], and present[^h5975] them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 8
And Aaron[^h175] shall cast[^h5414] lots[^h1486] upon the two[^h8147] goats[^h8163]; one[^h259] lot[^h1486] for the LORD[^h3068], and the other[^h259] lot[^h1486] for the scapegoat[^h5799]. 
###### 9
And Aaron[^h175] shall bring[^h7126] the goat[^h8163] upon which the LORD'S[^h3068] lot[^h1486] fell[^h5927], and offer[^h6213] him for a sin offering[^h2403]. 
###### 10
But the goat[^h8163], on which the lot[^h1486] fell[^h5927] to be the scapegoat[^h5799], shall be presented[^h5975] alive[^h2416] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to make an atonement[^h3722] with him, and to let him go[^h7971] for a scapegoat[^h5799] into the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 11
And Aaron[^h175] shall bring[^h7126] the bullock[^h6499] of the sin offering[^h2403], which is for himself, and shall make an atonement[^h3722] for himself, and for his house[^h1004], and shall kill[^h7819] the bullock[^h6499] of the sin offering[^h2403] which is for himself:
###### 12
And he shall take[^h3947] a censer[^h4289] full[^h4393] of burning[^h784] coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784] from off the altar[^h4196] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and his hands[^h2651] full[^h4393] of sweet[^h5561] incense[^h7004] beaten small[^h1851], and bring[^h935] it within[^h1004] the vail[^h6532]:
###### 13
And he shall put[^h5414] the incense[^h7004] upon the fire[^h784] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], that the cloud[^h6051] of the incense[^h7004] may cover[^h3680] the mercy seat[^h3727] that is upon the testimony[^h5715], that he die[^h4191] not:
###### 14
And he shall take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818] of the bullock[^h6499], and sprinkle[^h5137] it with his finger[^h676] upon the mercy seat[^h3727] eastward[^h6924]; and before[^h6440] the mercy seat[^h3727] shall he sprinkle[^h5137] of the blood[^h1818] with his finger[^h676] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471].
###### 15
Then shall he kill[^h7819] the goat[^h8163] of the sin offering[^h2403], that is for the people[^h5971], and bring[^h935] his blood[^h1818] within[^h1004] the vail[^h6532], and do[^h6213] with that blood[^h1818] as he did[^h6213] with the blood[^h1818] of the bullock[^h6499], and sprinkle[^h5137] it upon the mercy seat[^h3727], and before[^h6440] the mercy seat[^h3727]:
###### 16
And he shall make an atonement[^h3722] for the holy[^h6944] place, because of the uncleanness[^h2932] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and because of their transgressions[^h6588] in all their sins[^h2403]: and so shall he do[^h6213] for the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], that remaineth[^h7931] among them in the midst[^h8432] of their uncleanness[^h2932]. 
###### 17
And there shall be no man[^h120] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] when he goeth[^h935] in to make an atonement[^h3722] in the holy[^h6944] place, until he come out[^h3318], and have made an atonement[^h3722] for himself, and for his household[^h1004], and for all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
And he shall go out[^h3318] unto the altar[^h4196] that is before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and make an atonement[^h3722] for it; and shall take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818] of the bullock[^h6499], and of the blood[^h1818] of the goat[^h8163], and put[^h5414] it upon the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196] round about[^h5439].
###### 19
And he shall sprinkle[^h5137] of the blood[^h1818] upon it with his finger[^h676] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471], and cleanse[^h2891] it, and hallow[^h6942] it from the uncleanness[^h2932] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 20
And when he hath made an end[^h3615] of reconciling[^h3722] the holy[^h6944] place, and the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and the altar[^h4196], he shall bring[^h7126] the live[^h2416] goat[^h8163]:
###### 21
And Aaron[^h175] shall lay[^h5564] both[^h8147] his hands[^h3027] upon the head[^h7218] of the live[^h2416] goat[^h8163], and confess[^h3034] over him all the iniquities[^h5771] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and all their transgressions[^h6588] in all their sins[^h2403], putting[^h5414] them upon the head[^h7218] of the goat[^h8163], and shall send him away[^h7971] by the hand[^h3027] of a fit[^h6261] man[^h376] into the wilderness[^h4057]: 
###### 22
And the goat[^h8163] shall bear[^h5375] upon him all their iniquities[^h5771] unto a land[^h776] not inhabited[^h1509]: and he shall let go[^h7971] the goat[^h8163] in the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 23
And Aaron[^h175] shall come[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and shall put off[^h6584] the linen[^h906] garments[^h899], which he put on[^h3847] when he went[^h935] into the holy[^h6944] place, and shall leave[^h3240] them there:
###### 24
And he shall wash[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320] with water[^h4325] in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725], and put on[^h3847] his garments[^h899], and come forth[^h3318], and offer[^h6213] his burnt offering[^h5930], and the burnt offering[^h5930] of the people[^h5971], and make an atonement[^h3722] for himself, and for the people[^h5971].
###### 25
And the fat[^h2459] of the sin offering[^h2403] shall he burn[^h6999] upon the altar[^h4196].
###### 26
And he that let go[^h7971] the goat[^h8163] for the scapegoat[^h5799] shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and bathe[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320] in water[^h4325], and afterward[^h310] come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264].
###### 27
And the bullock[^h6499] for the sin offering[^h2403], and the goat[^h8163] for the sin offering[^h2403], whose blood[^h1818] was brought in[^h935] to make atonement[^h3722] in the holy[^h6944] place, shall one carry forth[^h3318] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264]; and they shall burn[^h8313] in the fire[^h784] their skins[^h5785], and their flesh[^h1320], and their dung[^h6569].
###### 28
And he that burneth[^h8313] them shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], and bathe[^h7364] his flesh[^h1320] in water[^h4325], and afterward[^h310] he shall come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264].
###### 29
And this shall be a statute[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] unto you: that in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320], on the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], ye shall afflict[^h6031] your souls[^h5315], and do[^h6213] no work[^h4399] at all, whether it be one of your own country[^h249], or a stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] among[^h8432] you:
###### 30
For on that day[^h3117] shall the priest make an atonement[^h3722] for you, to cleanse[^h2891] you, that ye may be clean[^h2891] from all your sins[^h2403] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 31
It shall be a sabbath[^h7676] of rest[^h7677] unto you, and ye shall afflict[^h6031] your souls[^h5315], by a statute[^h2708] for ever[^h5769].
###### 32
And the priest[^h3548], whom he shall anoint[^h4886], and whom he shall consecrate[^h4390] [^h3027] to minister in the priest's office[^h3547] in his father's[^h1] stead, shall make the atonement[^h3722], and shall put on[^h3847] the linen[^h906] clothes[^h899], even the holy[^h6944] garments[^h899]: 
###### 33
And he shall make an atonement[^h3722] for the holy[^h6944] sanctuary[^h4720], and he shall make an atonement[^h3722] for the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and for the altar[^h4196], and he shall make an atonement[^h3722] for the priests[^h3548], and for all the people[^h5971] of the congregation[^h6951].
###### 34
And this shall be an everlasting[^h5769] statute[^h2708] unto you, to make an atonement[^h3722] for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] for all their sins[^h2403] once[^h259] a year[^h8141]. And he did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].

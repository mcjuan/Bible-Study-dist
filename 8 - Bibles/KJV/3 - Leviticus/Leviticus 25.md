###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] in mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye come[^h935] into the land[^h776] which I give[^h5414] you, then shall the land[^h776] keep[^h7673] a sabbath[^h7676] unto the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 3
Six[^h8337] years[^h8141] thou shalt sow[^h2232] thy field[^h7704], and six[^h8337] years[^h8141] thou shalt prune[^h2168] thy vineyard[^h3754], and gather[^h622] in the fruit[^h8393] thereof;
###### 4
But in the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141] shall be a sabbath[^h7676] of rest[^h7677] unto the land[^h776], a sabbath[^h7676] for the LORD[^h3068]: thou shalt neither sow[^h2232] thy field[^h7704], nor prune[^h2168] thy vineyard[^h3754].
###### 5
That which groweth of its own accord[^h5599] of thy harvest[^h7105] thou shalt not reap[^h7114], neither gather[^h1219] the grapes[^h6025] of thy vine undressed[^h5139]: for it is a year[^h8141] of rest[^h7677] unto the land[^h776]. 
###### 6
And the sabbath[^h7676] of the land[^h776] shall be meat[^h402] for you; for thee, and for thy servant[^h5650], and for thy maid[^h519], and for thy hired servant[^h7916], and for thy stranger[^h8453] that sojourneth[^h1481] with thee,
###### 7
And for thy cattle[^h929], and for the beast[^h2416] that are in thy land[^h776], shall all the increase[^h8393] thereof be meat[^h398].
###### 8
And thou shalt number[^h5608] seven[^h7651] sabbaths[^h7676] of years[^h8141] unto thee, seven[^h7651] times[^h6471] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]; and the space[^h3117] of the seven[^h7651] sabbaths[^h7676] of years[^h8141] shall be unto thee forty[^h705] and nine[^h8672] years[^h8141].
###### 9
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet[^h7782] of the jubile[^h8643] to sound[^h5674] on the tenth[^h6218] day of the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320], in the day[^h3117] of atonement[^h3725] shall ye make the trumpet[^h7782] sound[^h5674] throughout all your land[^h776]. 
###### 10
And ye shall hallow[^h6942] the fiftieth[^h2572] [^h8141] year[^h8141], and proclaim[^h7121] liberty[^h1865] throughout all the land[^h776] unto all the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof: it shall be a jubile[^h3104] unto you; and ye shall return[^h7725] every man[^h376] unto his possession[^h272], and ye shall return[^h7725] every man[^h376] unto his family[^h4940].
###### 11
A jubile[^h3104] shall that fiftieth[^h2572] [^h8141] year[^h8141] be unto you: ye shall not sow[^h2232], neither reap[^h7114] that which groweth[^h5599] of itself in it, nor gather[^h1219] the grapes in it of thy vine undressed[^h5139].
###### 12
For it is the jubile[^h3104]; it shall be holy[^h6944] unto you: ye shall eat[^h398] the increase[^h8393] thereof out of the field[^h7704].
###### 13
In the year[^h8141] of this jubile[^h3104] ye shall return[^h7725] every man[^h376] unto his possession[^h272].
###### 14
And if thou sell[^h4376] ought[^h4465] unto thy neighbour[^h5997], or buyest[^h7069] ought of thy neighbour's[^h5997] hand[^h3027], ye shall not oppress[^h3238] one[^h376] another[^h251]:
###### 15
According to the number[^h4557] of years[^h8141] after[^h310] the jubile[^h3104] thou shalt buy[^h7069] of thy neighbour[^h5997], and according unto the number[^h4557] of years[^h8141] of the fruits[^h8393] he shall sell[^h4376] unto thee:
###### 16
According[^h6310] to the multitude[^h7230] of years[^h8141] thou shalt increase[^h7235] the price[^h4736] thereof, and according[^h6310] to the fewness[^h4591] of years[^h8141] thou shalt diminish[^h4591] the price[^h4736] of it: for according to the number[^h4557] of the years of the fruits[^h8393] doth he sell[^h4376] unto thee.
###### 17
Ye shall not therefore oppress[^h3238] one[^h376] another[^h5997]; but thou shalt fear[^h3372] thy God[^h430]: for I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 18
Wherefore ye shall do[^h6213] my statutes[^h2708], and keep[^h8104] my judgments[^h4941], and do[^h6213] them; and ye shall dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] in safety[^h983].
###### 19
And the land[^h776] shall yield[^h5414] her fruit[^h6529], and ye shall eat[^h398] your fill[^h7648], and dwell[^h3427] therein in safety[^h983].
###### 20
And if ye shall say[^h559], What shall we eat[^h398] the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141]? behold, we shall not sow[^h2232], nor gather[^h622] in our increase[^h8393]:
###### 21
Then I will command[^h6680] my blessing[^h1293] upon you in the sixth[^h8345] year[^h8141], and it shall bring forth[^h6213] fruit[^h8393] for three[^h7969] years[^h8141].
###### 22
And ye shall sow[^h2232] the eighth[^h8066] year[^h8141], and eat[^h398] yet of old[^h3465] fruit[^h8393] until the ninth[^h8671] year[^h8141]; until her fruits[^h8393] come in[^h935] ye shall eat[^h398] of the old[^h3465] store.
###### 23
The land[^h776] shall not be sold[^h4376] for ever[^h6783]: for the land[^h776] is mine; for ye are strangers[^h1616] and sojourners[^h8453] with me. 
###### 24
And in all the land[^h776] of your possession[^h272] ye shall grant[^h5414] a redemption[^h1353] for the land[^h776].
###### 25
If thy brother[^h251] be waxen poor[^h4134], and hath sold[^h4376] away some of his possession[^h272], and if any of his kin[^h7138] come[^h935] to redeem[^h1350] it, then shall he redeem[^h1350] that which his brother[^h251] sold[^h4465].
###### 26
And if the man[^h376] have none to redeem[^h1350] it, and himself[^h3027] be able[^h1767] [^h5381] to redeem[^h4672] [^h1353] it; 
###### 27
Then let him count[^h2803] the years[^h8141] of the sale[^h4465] thereof, and restore[^h7725] the overplus[^h5736] unto the man[^h376] to whom he sold[^h4376] it; that he may return[^h7725] unto his possession[^h272].
###### 28
But if he[^h3027] be not able[^h1767] to restore[^h4672] [^h7725] it to him, then that which is sold[^h4465] shall remain in the hand[^h3027] of him that hath bought[^h7069] it until the year[^h8141] of jubile[^h3104]: and in the jubile[^h3104] it shall go out[^h3318], and he shall return[^h7725] unto his possession[^h272].
###### 29
And if a man[^h376] sell[^h4376] a dwelling[^h4186] house[^h1004] in a walled[^h2346] city[^h5892], then he may redeem[^h1353] it within a whole[^h8552] year[^h8141] after it is sold[^h4465]; within a full year[^h3117] may he redeem[^h1353] it.
###### 30
And if it be not redeemed[^h1350] within the space[^h4390] of a full[^h8549] year[^h8141], then the house[^h1004] that is in the walled[^h2346] city[^h5892] shall be established[^h6965] for ever[^h6783] to him that bought[^h7069] it throughout his generations[^h1755]: it shall not go out[^h3318] in the jubile[^h3104].
###### 31
But the houses[^h1004] of the villages[^h2691] which have no wall[^h2346] round about[^h5439] them shall be counted[^h2803] as the fields[^h7704] of the country[^h776]: they may be redeemed[^h1353], and they shall go out[^h3318] in the jubile[^h3104]. 
###### 32
Notwithstanding the cities[^h5892] of the Levites[^h3881], and the houses[^h1004] of the cities[^h5892] of their possession[^h272], may the Levites[^h3881] redeem[^h1353] at any time[^h5769].
###### 33
And if a man purchase[^h1350] of the Levites[^h3881], then the house[^h1004] that was sold[^h4465], and the city[^h5892] of his possession[^h272], shall go out[^h3318] in the year of jubile[^h3104]: for the houses[^h1004] of the cities[^h5892] of the Levites[^h3881] are their possession[^h272] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 34
But the field[^h7704] of the suburbs[^h4054] of their cities[^h5892] may not be sold[^h4376]; for it is their perpetual[^h5769] possession[^h272].
###### 35
And if thy brother[^h251] be waxen poor[^h4134], and fallen in decay[^h4131] with thee[^h3027]; then thou shalt relieve[^h2388] him: yea, though he be a stranger[^h1616], or a sojourner[^h8453]; that he may live[^h2416] with thee.  
###### 36
Take[^h3947] thou no usury[^h5392] of him, or increase[^h8636]: but fear[^h3372] thy God[^h430]; that thy brother[^h251] may live[^h2416] with thee.
###### 37
Thou shalt not give[^h5414] him thy money[^h3701] upon usury[^h5392], nor lend[^h5414] him thy victuals[^h400] for increase[^h4768].
###### 38
I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which brought you forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], to give[^h5414] you the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and to be your God[^h430].
###### 39
And if thy brother[^h251] that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor[^h4134], and be sold[^h4376] unto thee; thou shalt not compel[^h5647] him to serve[^h5656] as a bondservant[^h5650]: 
###### 40
But as an hired servant[^h7916], and as a sojourner[^h8453], he shall be with thee, and shall serve[^h5647] thee unto the year[^h8141] of jubile[^h3104]:
###### 41
And then shall he depart[^h3318] from thee, both he and his children[^h1121] with him, and shall return[^h7725] unto his own family[^h4940], and unto the possession[^h272] of his fathers[^h1] shall he return[^h7725].
###### 42
For they are my servants[^h5650], which I brought forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: they shall not be sold[^h4376] as[^h4466] bondmen[^h5650]. 
###### 43
Thou shalt not rule[^h7287] over him with rigour[^h6531]; but shalt fear[^h3372] thy God[^h430].
###### 44
Both thy bondmen[^h5650], and thy bondmaids[^h519], which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] you; of them shall ye buy[^h7069] bondmen[^h5650] and bondmaids[^h519].
###### 45
Moreover of the children[^h1121] of the strangers[^h8453] that do sojourn[^h1481] among you, of them shall ye buy[^h7069], and of their families[^h4940] that are with you, which they begat[^h3205] in your land[^h776]: and they shall be your possession[^h272].
###### 46
And ye shall take them as an inheritance[^h5157] for your children[^h1121] after[^h310] you, to inherit[^h3423] them for a possession[^h272]; they shall be your bondmen[^h5647] for ever[^h5769]: but over your brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], ye shall not rule[^h7287] one[^h376] over another[^h251] with rigour[^h6531]. 
###### 47
And if a sojourner[^h1616] or stranger[^h8453] wax rich[^h5381] by thee[^h3027], and thy brother[^h251] that dwelleth by him wax poor[^h4134], and sell[^h4376] himself unto the stranger[^h1616] or sojourner[^h8453] by thee, or to the stock[^h6133] of the stranger's[^h1616] family[^h4940]: 
###### 48
After[^h310] that he is sold[^h4376] he may be redeemed again[^h1353]; one[^h259] of his brethren[^h251] may redeem[^h1350] him:
###### 49
Either his uncle[^h1730], or his uncle's[^h1730] son[^h1121], may redeem[^h1350] him, or any that is nigh[^h7607] of kin[^h1320] unto him of his family[^h4940] may redeem[^h1350] him; or if he be able[^h5381], he may redeem[^h1350] himself[^h3027].
###### 50
And he shall reckon[^h2803] with him that bought[^h7069] him from the year[^h8141] that he was sold[^h4376] to him unto the year[^h8141] of jubile[^h3104]: and the price[^h3701] of his sale[^h4465] shall be according unto the number[^h4557] of years[^h8141], according to the time[^h3117] of an hired servant[^h7916] shall it be with him.
###### 51
If there be yet many[^h7227] years[^h8141] behind, according[^h6310] unto them he shall give again[^h7725] the price of his redemption[^h1353] out of the money[^h3701] that he was bought[^h4736] for.
###### 52
And if there remain[^h7604] but few[^h4592] years[^h8141] unto the year[^h8141] of jubile[^h3104], then he shall count[^h2803] with him, and according[^h6310] unto his years[^h8141] shall he give him again[^h7725] the price of his redemption[^h1353].
###### 53
And as a yearly[^h8141] [^h8141] hired servant[^h7916] shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule[^h7287] with rigour[^h6531] over him in thy sight[^h5869].
###### 54
And if he be not redeemed[^h1350] in these years, then he shall go out[^h3318] in the year[^h8141] of jubile[^h3104], both he, and his children[^h1121] with him. 
###### 55
For unto me the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] are servants[^h5650]; they are my servants[^h5650] whom I brought forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].

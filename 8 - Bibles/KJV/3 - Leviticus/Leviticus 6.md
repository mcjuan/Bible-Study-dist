###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
If a soul[^h5315] sin[^h2398], and commit[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068], and lie[^h3584] unto his neighbour[^h5997] in that which was delivered[^h6487] him to keep, or in fellowship[^h8667] [^h3027], or in a thing taken away by violence[^h1498], or hath deceived[^h6231] his neighbour[^h5997];  
###### 3
Or have found[^h4672] that which was lost[^h9], and lieth[^h3584] concerning it, and sweareth[^h7650] falsely[^h8267]; in any[^h259] of all these that a man[^h120] doeth[^h6213], sinning[^h2398] therein[^h2007]:
###### 4
Then it shall be, because he hath sinned[^h2398], and is guilty[^h816], that he shall restore[^h7725] that[^h1500] which he took violently away[^h1497], or the thing[^h6233] which he hath deceitfully gotten[^h6231], or that which was delivered[^h6487] [^h853] him to keep[^h6485], or the lost thing[^h9] which he found[^h4672],
###### 5
Or all that about which he hath sworn[^h7650] falsely[^h8267]; he shall even restore[^h7999] it in the principal[^h7218], and shall add[^h3254] the fifth part[^h2549] more[^h3254] thereto, and give[^h5414] it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day[^h3117] of his trespass offering[^h819]. 
###### 6
And he shall bring[^h935] his trespass offering[^h817] unto the LORD[^h3068], a ram[^h352] without blemish[^h8549] out of the flock[^h6629], with thy estimation[^h6187], for a trespass offering[^h817], unto the priest[^h3548]:
###### 7
And the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for him before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him for any thing[^h259] of all that he hath done[^h6213] in trespassing[^h819] therein.
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 9
Command[^h6680] Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121], saying[^h559], This is the law[^h8451] of the burnt offering[^h5930]: It is the burnt offering[^h5930], because of the burning[^h4169] upon the altar[^h4196] all night[^h3915] unto the morning[^h1242], and the fire[^h784] of the altar[^h4196] shall be burning[^h3344] in it. 
###### 10
And the priest[^h3548] shall put[^h3847] on his linen[^h906] garment[^h4055], and his linen[^h906] breeches[^h4370] shall he put[^h3847] upon his flesh[^h1320], and take up[^h7311] the ashes[^h1880] which the fire[^h784] hath consumed[^h398] with the burnt offering[^h5930] on the altar[^h4196], and he shall put[^h7760] them beside[^h681] the altar[^h4196].
###### 11
And he shall put off[^h6584] his garments[^h899], and put on[^h3847] other[^h312] garments[^h899], and carry forth[^h3318] the ashes[^h1880] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264] unto a clean[^h2889] place[^h4725].
###### 12
And the fire[^h784] upon the altar[^h4196] shall be burning[^h3344] in it; it shall not be put out[^h3518]: and the priest[^h3548] shall burn[^h1197] wood[^h6086] on it every morning[^h1242], and lay the burnt offering[^h5930] in order[^h6186] upon it; and he shall burn[^h6999] thereon the fat[^h2459] of the peace offerings[^h8002].
###### 13
The fire[^h784] shall ever[^h8548] be burning[^h3344] upon the altar[^h4196]; it shall never go out[^h3518].
###### 14
And this is the law[^h8451] of the meat offering[^h4503]: the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] shall offer[^h7126] it before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196].
###### 15
And he shall take[^h7311] of it his handful[^h7062], of the flour[^h5560] of the meat offering[^h4503], and of the oil[^h8081] thereof, and all the frankincense[^h3828] which is upon the meat offering[^h4503], and shall burn[^h6999] it upon the altar[^h4196] for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381], even the memorial[^h234] of it, unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And the remainder[^h3498] thereof shall Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] eat[^h398]: with unleavened bread[^h4682] shall it be eaten[^h398] in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725]; in the court[^h2691] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] they shall eat[^h398] it.
###### 17
It shall not be baken[^h644] with leaven[^h2557]. I have given[^h5414] it unto them for their portion[^h2506] of my offerings made by fire[^h801]; it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944], as is the sin offering[^h2403], and as the trespass offering[^h817].
###### 18
All the males[^h2145] among the children[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] shall eat[^h398] of it. It shall be a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769] in your generations[^h1755] concerning the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801]: every one that toucheth[^h5060] them shall be holy[^h6942].
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 20
This is the offering[^h7133] of Aaron[^h175] and of his sons[^h1121], which they shall offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068] in the day[^h3117] when he is anointed[^h4886]; the tenth part[^h6224] of an ephah[^h374] of fine flour[^h5560] for a meat offering[^h4503] perpetual[^h8548], half[^h4276] of it in the morning[^h1242], and half[^h4276] thereof at night[^h6153].
###### 21
In a pan[^h4227] it shall be made[^h6213] with oil[^h8081]; and when it is baken[^h7246], thou shalt bring[^h935] it in: and the baken[^h8601] pieces[^h6595] of the meat offering[^h4503] shalt thou offer[^h7126] for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
And the priest[^h3548] of his sons[^h1121] that is anointed[^h4899] in his stead shall offer[^h6213] it: it is a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769] unto the LORD[^h3068]; it shall be wholly[^h3632] burnt[^h6999].
###### 23
For every meat offering[^h4503] for the priest[^h3548] shall be wholly burnt[^h3632]: it shall not be eaten[^h398].
###### 24
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 25
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175] and to his sons[^h1121], saying[^h559], This is the law[^h8451] of the sin offering[^h2403]: In the place[^h4725] where the burnt offering[^h5930] is killed[^h7819] shall the sin offering[^h2403] be killed[^h7819] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944].
###### 26
The priest[^h3548] that offereth it for sin[^h2398] shall eat[^h398] it: in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725] shall it be eaten[^h398], in the court[^h2691] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 27
Whatsoever shall touch[^h5060] the flesh[^h1320] thereof shall be holy[^h6942]: and when there is sprinkled[^h5137] of the blood[^h1818] thereof upon any garment[^h899], thou shalt wash[^h3526] that whereon it was sprinkled[^h5137] in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725].
###### 28
But the earthen[^h2789] vessel[^h3627] wherein it is sodden[^h1310] shall be broken[^h7665]: and if it be sodden[^h1310] in a brasen[^h5178] pot[^h3627], it shall be both scoured[^h4838], and rinsed[^h7857] in water[^h4325].
###### 29
All the males[^h2145] among the priests[^h3548] shall eat[^h398] thereof: it is most[^h6944] holy[^h6944].
###### 30
And no sin offering[^h2403], whereof any of the blood[^h1818] is brought[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] to reconcile[^h3722] withal in the holy[^h6944] place, shall be eaten[^h398]: it shall be burnt[^h8313] in the fire[^h784].

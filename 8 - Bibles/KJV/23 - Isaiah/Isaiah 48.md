###### 1
Hear[^h8085] ye this, O house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], which are called[^h7121] by the name[^h8034] of Israel[^h3478], and are come forth[^h3318] out of the waters[^h4325] of Judah[^h3063], which swear[^h7650] by the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], and make mention[^h2142] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], but not in truth[^h571], nor in righteousness[^h6666].
###### 2
For they call[^h7121] themselves of the holy[^h6944] city[^h5892], and stay[^h5564] themselves upon the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; The LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is his name[^h8034].
###### 3
I have declared[^h5046] the former things[^h7223] from the beginning[^h227]; and they went forth[^h3318] out of my mouth[^h6310], and I shewed[^h8085] them; I did[^h6213] them suddenly[^h6597], and they came to pass[^h935].
###### 4
Because I knew[^h1847] that thou art obstinate[^h7186], and thy neck[^h6203] is an iron[^h1270] sinew[^h1517], and thy brow[^h4696] brass[^h5154]; 
###### 5
I have even from the beginning[^h227] declared[^h5046] it to thee; before it came to pass[^h935] I shewed[^h8085] it thee: lest thou shouldest say[^h559], Mine idol[^h6090] hath done[^h6213] them, and my graven image[^h6459], and my molten image[^h5262], hath commanded[^h6680] them.
###### 6
Thou hast heard[^h8085], see[^h2372] all this; and will not ye declare[^h5046] it? I have shewed[^h8085] thee new things[^h2319] from this time[^h6258], even hidden things[^h5341], and thou didst not know[^h3045] them.
###### 7
They are created[^h1254] now, and not from the beginning; even before[^h6440] the day[^h3117] when thou heardest[^h8085] them not; lest thou shouldest say[^h559], Behold, I knew[^h3045] them.
###### 8
Yea, thou heardest[^h8085] not; yea, thou knewest[^h3045] not; yea, from that time that thine ear[^h241] was not opened[^h6605]: for I knew[^h3045] that thou wouldest deal very[^h898] treacherously[^h898], and wast called[^h7121] a transgressor[^h6586] from the womb[^h990].
###### 9
For my name's[^h8034] sake will I defer[^h748] mine anger[^h639], and for my praise[^h8416] will I refrain[^h2413] for thee, that I cut thee not off[^h3772].
###### 10
Behold, I have refined[^h6884] thee, but not with silver[^h3701]; I have chosen[^h977] thee in the furnace[^h3564] of affliction[^h6040]. 
###### 11
For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do[^h6213] it: for how should my name be polluted[^h2490]? and I will not give[^h5414] my glory[^h3519] unto another[^h312].
###### 12
Hearken[^h8085] unto me, O Jacob[^h3290] and Israel[^h3478], my called[^h7121]; I am he; I am the first[^h7223], I also am the last[^h314].
###### 13
Mine hand[^h3027] also hath laid the foundation[^h3245] of the earth[^h776], and my right hand[^h3225] hath spanned[^h2946] the heavens[^h8064]: when I call[^h7121] unto them, they stand up[^h5975] together[^h3162]. 
###### 14
All ye, assemble[^h6908] yourselves, and hear[^h8085]; which among them hath declared[^h5046] these things? The LORD[^h3068] hath loved[^h157] him: he will do[^h6213] his pleasure[^h2656] on Babylon[^h894], and his arm[^h2220] shall be on the Chaldeans[^h3778].
###### 15
I, even I, have spoken[^h1696]; yea, I have called[^h7121] him: I have brought[^h935] him, and he shall make his way[^h1870] prosperous[^h6743].
###### 16
Come[^h7126] ye near[^h7126] unto me, hear[^h8085] ye this; I have not spoken[^h1696] in secret[^h5643] from the beginning[^h7218]; from the time[^h6256] that it was, there am I: and now the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], and his Spirit[^h7307], hath sent[^h7971] me.
###### 17
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], thy Redeemer[^h1350], the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478]; I am the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] which teacheth[^h3925] thee to profit[^h3276], which leadeth[^h1869] thee by the way[^h1870] that thou shouldest go[^h3212].
###### 18
O that[^h3863] thou hadst hearkened[^h7181] to my commandments[^h4687]! then had thy peace[^h7965] been as a river[^h5104], and thy righteousness[^h6666] as the waves[^h1530] of the sea[^h3220]:
###### 19
Thy seed[^h2233] also had been as the sand[^h2344], and the offspring[^h6631] of thy bowels[^h4578] like the gravel[^h4579] thereof; his name[^h8034] should not have been cut off[^h3772] nor destroyed[^h8045] from before[^h6440] me.
###### 20
Go ye forth[^h3318] of Babylon[^h894], flee[^h1272] ye from the Chaldeans[^h3778], with a voice[^h6963] of singing[^h7440] declare[^h5046] ye, tell[^h8085] this, utter[^h3318] it even to the end[^h7097] of the earth[^h776]; say[^h559] ye, The LORD[^h3068] hath redeemed[^h1350] his servant[^h5650] Jacob[^h3290].
###### 21
And they thirsted[^h6770] not when he led[^h3212] them through the deserts[^h2723]: he caused the waters[^h4325] to flow[^h5140] out of the rock[^h6697] for them: he clave[^h1234] the rock[^h6697] also, and the waters[^h4325] gushed out[^h2100].
###### 22
There is no peace[^h7965], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], unto the wicked[^h7563].

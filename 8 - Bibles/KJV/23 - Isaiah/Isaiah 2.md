**[[KJV/23 - Isaiah/Isaiah 1|⏪ Isaiah 1]] | [[KJV/23 - Isaiah/Isaiah|Isaiah Chapter Index]] | [[KJV/23 - Isaiah/Isaiah 3|Isaiah 3 ⏩]]**

###### 1
The word[^h1697] that Isaiah[^h3470] the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531] saw[^h2372] concerning Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
And it shall come to pass in the last[^h319] days[^h3117], that the mountain[^h2022] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004] shall be established[^h3559] in the top[^h7218] of the mountains[^h2022], and shall be exalted[^h5375] above the hills[^h1389]; and all nations[^h1471] shall flow[^h5102] unto it. 
###### 3
And many[^h7227] people[^h5971] shall go[^h1980] and say[^h559], Come[^h3212] ye, and let us go up[^h5927] to the mountain[^h2022] of the LORD[^h3068], to the house[^h1004] of the God[^h430] of Jacob[^h3290]; and he will teach[^h3384] us of his ways[^h1870], and we will walk[^h3212] in his paths[^h734]: for out of Zion[^h6726] shall go forth[^h3318] the law[^h8451], and the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] from Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 4
And he shall judge[^h8199] among the nations[^h1471], and shall rebuke[^h3198] many[^h7227] people[^h5971]: and they shall beat[^h3807] their swords[^h2719] into plowshares[^h855], and their spears[^h2595] into pruninghooks[^h4211]: nation[^h1471] shall not lift up[^h5375] sword[^h2719] against nation[^h1471], neither shall they learn[^h3925] war[^h4421] any more. 
###### 5
O house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], come[^h3212] ye, and let us walk[^h3212] in the light[^h216] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
Therefore thou hast forsaken[^h5203] thy people[^h5971] the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], because they be replenished[^h4390] from the east[^h6924], and are soothsayers[^h6049] like the Philistines[^h6430], and they please[^h5606] themselves in the children[^h3206] of strangers[^h5237].  
###### 7
Their land[^h776] also is full[^h4390] of silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], neither is there any end[^h7097] of their treasures[^h214]; their land[^h776] is also full[^h4390] of horses[^h5483], neither is there any end[^h7097] of their chariots[^h4818]:
###### 8
Their land[^h776] also is full[^h4390] of idols[^h457]; they worship[^h7812] the work[^h4639] of their own hands[^h3027], that which their own fingers[^h676] have made[^h6213]:
###### 9
And the mean man[^h120] boweth down[^h7817], and the great man[^h376] humbleth[^h8213] himself: therefore forgive[^h5375] them not.
###### 10
Enter[^h935] into the rock[^h6697], and hide[^h2934] thee in the dust[^h6083], for[^h6440] fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the glory[^h1926] of his majesty[^h1347].
###### 11
The lofty[^h1365] looks[^h5869] of man[^h120] shall be humbled[^h8213], and the haughtiness[^h7312] of men[^h582] shall be bowed down[^h7817], and the LORD[^h3068] alone shall be exalted[^h7682] in that day[^h3117].
###### 12
For the day[^h3117] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] shall be upon every one that is proud[^h1343] and lofty[^h7311], and upon every one that is lifted up[^h5375]; and he shall be brought low[^h8213]:
###### 13
And upon all the cedars[^h730] of Lebanon[^h3844], that are high[^h7311] and lifted up[^h5375], and upon all the oaks[^h437] of Bashan[^h1316],
###### 14
And upon all the high[^h7311] mountains[^h2022], and upon all the hills[^h1389] that are lifted up[^h5375],
###### 15
And upon every high[^h1364] tower[^h4026], and upon every fenced[^h1219] wall[^h2346],
###### 16
And upon all the ships[^h591] of Tarshish[^h8659], and upon all pleasant[^h2532] pictures[^h7914]. 
###### 17
And the loftiness[^h1365] of man[^h120] shall be bowed down[^h7817], and the haughtiness[^h7312] of men[^h582] shall be made low[^h8213]: and the LORD[^h3068] alone shall be exalted[^h7682] in that day[^h3117].
###### 18
And the idols[^h457] he shall utterly[^h3632] abolish[^h2498]. 
###### 19
And they shall go[^h935] into the holes[^h4631] of the rocks[^h6697], and into the caves[^h4247] of the earth[^h6083], for[^h6440] fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the glory[^h1926] of his majesty[^h1347], when he ariseth[^h6965] to shake terribly[^h6206] the earth[^h776]. 
###### 20
In that day[^h3117] a man[^h120] shall cast[^h7993] his idols[^h457] of silver[^h3701], and his idols[^h457] of gold[^h2091], which they made each one for himself[^h6213] to worship[^h7812], to the moles[^h2661] [^h6512] and to the bats[^h5847];  
###### 21
To go[^h935] into the clefts[^h5366] of the rocks[^h6697], and into the tops[^h5585] of the ragged rocks[^h5553], for[^h6440] fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the glory[^h1926] of his majesty[^h1347], when he ariseth[^h6965] to shake terribly[^h6206] the earth[^h776].
###### 22
Cease[^h2308] ye from man[^h120], whose breath[^h5397] is in his nostrils[^h639]: for wherein is he to be accounted of[^h2803]?

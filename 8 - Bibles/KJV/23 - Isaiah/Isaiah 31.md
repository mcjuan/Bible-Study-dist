###### 1
Woe[^h1945] to them that go down[^h3381] to Egypt[^h4714] for help[^h5833]; and stay[^h8172] on horses[^h5483], and trust[^h982] in chariots[^h7393], because they are many[^h7227]; and in horsemen[^h6571], because they are very[^h3966] strong[^h6105]; but they look[^h8159] not unto the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478], neither seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068]!
###### 2
Yet he also is wise[^h2450], and will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451], and will not call back[^h5493] his words[^h1697]: but will arise[^h6965] against the house[^h1004] of the evildoers[^h7489], and against the help[^h5833] of them that work[^h6466] iniquity[^h205]. 
###### 3
Now the Egyptians[^h4714] are men[^h120], and not God[^h410]; and their horses[^h5483] flesh[^h1320], and not spirit[^h7307]. When the LORD[^h3068] shall stretch out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027], both he that helpeth[^h5826] shall fall[^h3782], and he that is holpen[^h5826] shall fall down[^h5307], and they all shall fail[^h3615] together[^h3162].
###### 4
For thus hath the LORD[^h3068] spoken[^h559] unto me, Like as the lion[^h738] and the young lion[^h3715] roaring[^h1897] on his prey[^h2964], when a multitude[^h4393] of shepherds[^h7462] is called forth[^h7121] against him, he will not be afraid[^h2865] of their voice[^h6963], nor abase[^h6031] himself for the noise[^h1995] of them: so shall the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] come down[^h3381] to fight[^h6633] for mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726], and for the hill[^h1389] thereof. 
###### 5
As birds[^h6833] flying[^h5774], so will the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] defend[^h1598] Jerusalem[^h3389]; defending[^h1598] also he will deliver[^h5337] it; and passing over[^h6452] he will preserve[^h4422] it.
###### 6
Turn[^h7725] ye unto him from whom the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] have deeply[^h6009] revolted[^h5627].
###### 7
For in that day[^h3117] every man[^h376] shall cast away[^h3988] his idols[^h457] of silver[^h3701], and his idols[^h457] of gold[^h2091], which your own hands[^h3027] have made[^h6213] unto you for a sin[^h2399]. 
###### 8
Then shall the Assyrian[^h804] fall[^h5307] with the sword[^h2719], not of a mighty man[^h376]; and the sword[^h2719], not of a mean man[^h120], shall devour[^h398] him: but he shall flee[^h5127] from[^h6440] the sword[^h2719], and his young men[^h970] shall be discomfited[^h4522].  
###### 9
And he shall pass over[^h5674] to his strong hold[^h5553] for fear[^h4032], and his princes[^h8269] shall be afraid[^h2865] of the ensign[^h5251], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], whose fire[^h217] is in Zion[^h6726], and his furnace[^h8574] in Jerusalem[^h3389].

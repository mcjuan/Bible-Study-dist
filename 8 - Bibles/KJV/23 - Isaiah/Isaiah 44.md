###### 1
Yet now hear[^h8085], O Jacob[^h3290] my servant[^h5650]; and Israel[^h3478], whom I have chosen[^h977]:
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] that made[^h6213] thee, and formed[^h3335] thee from the womb[^h990], which will help[^h5826] thee; Fear[^h3372] not, O Jacob[^h3290], my servant[^h5650]; and thou, Jesurun[^h3484], whom I have chosen[^h977].
###### 3
For I will pour[^h3332] water[^h4325] upon him that is thirsty[^h6771], and floods[^h5140] upon the dry ground[^h3004]: I will pour[^h3332] my spirit[^h7307] upon thy seed[^h2233], and my blessing[^h1293] upon thine offspring[^h6631]:
###### 4
And they shall spring up[^h6779] as among[^h996] the grass[^h2682], as willows[^h6155] by the water[^h4325] courses[^h2988].
###### 5
One shall say[^h559], I am the LORD'S[^h3068]; and another shall call[^h7121] himself by the name[^h8034] of Jacob[^h3290]; and another shall subscribe[^h3789] with his hand[^h3027] unto the LORD[^h3068], and surname[^h3655] himself by the name[^h8034] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] the King[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and his redeemer[^h1350] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; I am the first[^h7223], and I am the last[^h314]; and beside[^h1107] me there is no God[^h430].
###### 7
And who, as I, shall call[^h7121], and shall declare[^h5046] it, and set it in order[^h6186] for me, since I appointed[^h7760] the ancient[^h5769] people[^h5971]? and the things that are coming[^h857], and shall come[^h935], let them shew[^h5046] unto them.
###### 8
Fear[^h6342] ye not, neither be afraid[^h7297] [^h7297]: have not I told[^h8085] thee from that time[^h227], and have declared[^h5046] it? ye are even my witnesses[^h5707]. Is there[^h3426] a God[^h433] beside[^h1107] me? yea, there is no God[^h6697]; I know[^h3045] not any. 
###### 9
They that make[^h3335] a graven image[^h6459] are all of them vanity[^h8414]; and their delectable things[^h2530] shall not profit[^h3276]; and they are their own witnesses[^h5707]; they see[^h7200] not, nor know[^h3045]; that they may be ashamed[^h954]. 
###### 10
Who hath formed[^h3335] a god[^h410], or molten[^h5258] a graven image[^h6459] that is profitable[^h3276] for nothing[^h1115]?
###### 11
Behold, all his fellows[^h2270] shall be ashamed[^h954]: and the workmen[^h2796], they are of men[^h120]: let them all be gathered together[^h6908], let them stand up[^h5975]; yet they shall fear[^h6342], and they shall be ashamed[^h954] together[^h3162].
###### 12
The smith[^h1270] [^h2796] with the tongs[^h4621] both worketh[^h6466] in the coals[^h6352], and fashioneth[^h3335] it with hammers[^h4717], and worketh[^h6466] it with the strength[^h3581] of his arms[^h2220]: yea, he is hungry[^h7457], and his strength[^h3581] faileth[^h369]: he drinketh[^h8354] no water[^h4325], and is faint[^h3286]. 
###### 13
The carpenter[^h2796] [^h6086] stretcheth out[^h5186] his rule[^h6957]; he marketh it out[^h8388] with a line[^h8279]; he fitteth[^h6213] it with planes[^h4741], and he marketh it out[^h8388] with the compass[^h4230], and maketh[^h6213] it after the figure[^h8403] of a man[^h376], according to the beauty[^h8597] of a man[^h120]; that it may remain[^h3427] in the house[^h1004].
###### 14
He heweth him down[^h3772] cedars[^h730], and taketh[^h3947] the cypress[^h8645] and the oak[^h437], which he strengtheneth[^h553] for himself among the trees[^h6086] of the forest[^h3293]: he planteth[^h5193] an ash[^h766], and the rain[^h1653] doth nourish[^h1431] it. 
###### 15
Then shall it be for a man[^h120] to burn[^h1197]: for he will take[^h3947] thereof, and warm[^h2552] himself; yea, he kindleth[^h5400] it, and baketh[^h644] bread[^h3899]; yea, he maketh[^h6466] a god[^h410], and worshippeth[^h7812] it; he maketh[^h6213] it a graven image[^h6459], and falleth down[^h5456] thereto.
###### 16
He burneth[^h8313] part[^h2677] thereof in[^h1119] the fire[^h784]; with part[^h2677] thereof he eateth[^h398] flesh[^h1320]; he roasteth[^h6740] roast[^h6748], and is satisfied[^h7646]: yea, he warmeth[^h2552] himself, and saith[^h559], Aha[^h1889], I am warm[^h2552], I have seen[^h7200] the fire[^h217]:
###### 17
And the residue[^h7611] thereof he maketh[^h6213] a god[^h410], even his graven image[^h6459]: he falleth down[^h5456] unto it, and worshippeth[^h7812] it, and prayeth[^h6419] unto it, and saith[^h559], Deliver[^h5337] me; for thou art my god[^h410].
###### 18
They have not known[^h3045] nor understood[^h995]: for he hath shut[^h2902] their eyes[^h5869], that they cannot see[^h7200]; and their hearts[^h3826], that they cannot understand[^h7919]. 
###### 19
And none considereth[^h7725] in his heart[^h3820], neither is there knowledge[^h1847] nor understanding[^h8394] to say[^h559], I have burned[^h8313] part[^h2677] of it in[^h1119] the fire[^h784]; yea, also I have baked[^h644] bread[^h3899] upon the coals[^h1513] thereof; I have roasted[^h6740] flesh[^h1320], and eaten[^h398] it: and shall I make[^h6213] the residue[^h3499] thereof an abomination[^h8441]? shall I fall down[^h5456] to the stock[^h944] of a tree[^h6086]?  
###### 20
He feedeth[^h7462] on ashes[^h665]: a deceived[^h2048] heart[^h3820] hath turned him aside[^h5186], that he cannot deliver[^h5337] his soul[^h5315], nor say[^h559], Is there not a lie[^h8267] in my right hand[^h3225]?
###### 21
Remember[^h2142] these, O Jacob[^h3290] and Israel[^h3478]; for thou art my servant[^h5650]: I have formed[^h3335] thee; thou art my servant[^h5650]: O Israel[^h3478], thou shalt not be forgotten[^h5382] of me.
###### 22
I have blotted out[^h4229], as a thick cloud[^h5645], thy transgressions[^h6588], and, as a cloud[^h6051], thy sins[^h2403]: return[^h7725] unto me; for I have redeemed[^h1350] thee.
###### 23
Sing[^h7442], O ye heavens[^h8064]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath done[^h6213] it: shout[^h7321], ye lower parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776]: break forth[^h6476] into singing[^h7440], ye mountains[^h2022], O forest[^h3293], and every tree[^h6086] therein: for the LORD[^h3068] hath redeemed[^h1350] Jacob[^h3290], and glorified[^h6286] himself in Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], thy redeemer[^h1350], and he that formed[^h3335] thee from the womb[^h990], I am the LORD[^h3068] that maketh[^h6213] all things; that stretcheth forth[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064] alone; that spreadeth abroad[^h7554] the earth[^h776] by myself;
###### 25
That frustrateth[^h6565] the tokens[^h226] of the liars[^h907], and maketh diviners[^h7080] mad[^h1984]; that turneth[^h7725] wise[^h2450] men backward[^h268], and maketh their knowledge[^h1847] foolish[^h5528];
###### 26
That confirmeth[^h6965] the word[^h1697] of his servant[^h5650], and performeth[^h7999] the counsel[^h6098] of his messengers[^h4397]; that saith[^h559] to Jerusalem[^h3389], Thou shalt be inhabited[^h3427]; and to the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], Ye shall be built[^h1129], and I will raise up[^h6965] the decayed places[^h2723] thereof: 
###### 27
That saith[^h559] to the deep[^h6683], Be dry[^h2717], and I will dry up[^h3001] thy rivers[^h5104]:
###### 28
That saith[^h559] of Cyrus[^h3566], He is my shepherd[^h7462], and shall perform[^h7999] all my pleasure[^h2656]: even saying[^h559] to Jerusalem[^h3389], Thou shalt be built[^h1129]; and to the temple[^h1964], Thy foundation shall be laid[^h3245].

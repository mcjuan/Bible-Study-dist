###### 1
At that time[^h6256] Merodachbaladan[^h4757], the son[^h1121] of Baladan[^h1081], king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] and a present[^h4503] to Hezekiah[^h2396]: for he had heard[^h8085] that he had been sick[^h2470], and was recovered[^h2388].
###### 2
And Hezekiah[^h2396] was glad[^h8055] of them, and shewed[^h7200] them the house[^h1004] of his precious things[^h5238], the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the spices[^h1314], and the precious[^h2896] ointment[^h8081], and all the house[^h1004] of his armour[^h3627], and all that was found[^h4672] in his treasures[^h214]: there was nothing[^h1697] in his house[^h1004], nor in all his dominion[^h4475], that Hezekiah[^h2396] shewed[^h7200] them not.  
###### 3
Then came[^h935] Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030] unto king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396], and said[^h559] unto him, What said[^h559] these men[^h582]? and from whence[^h370] came[^h935] they unto thee? And Hezekiah[^h2396] said[^h559], They are come[^h935] from a far[^h7350] country[^h776] unto me, even from Babylon[^h894].
###### 4
Then said[^h559] he, What have they seen[^h7200] in thine house[^h1004]? And Hezekiah[^h2396] answered[^h559], All that is in mine house[^h1004] have they seen[^h7200]: there is nothing[^h1697] among my treasures[^h214] that I have not shewed[^h7200] them.
###### 5
Then said[^h559] Isaiah[^h3470] to Hezekiah[^h2396], Hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]:
###### 6
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], that all that is in thine house[^h1004], and that which thy fathers[^h1] have laid up in store[^h686] until this day[^h3117], shall be carried[^h5375] to Babylon[^h894]: nothing[^h1697] shall be left[^h3498], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
And of thy sons[^h1121] that shall issue[^h3318] from thee, which thou shalt beget[^h3205], shall they take away[^h3947]; and they shall be eunuchs[^h5631] in the palace[^h1964] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 8
Then said[^h559] Hezekiah[^h2396] to Isaiah[^h3470], Good[^h2896] is the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which thou hast spoken[^h1696]. He said[^h559] moreover, For there shall be peace[^h7965] and truth[^h571] in my days[^h3117].

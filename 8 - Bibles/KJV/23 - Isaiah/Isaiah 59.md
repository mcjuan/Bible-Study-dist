###### 1
Behold[^h2005], the LORD'S[^h3068] hand[^h3027] is not shortened[^h7114], that it cannot save[^h3467]; neither his ear[^h241] heavy[^h3513], that it cannot hear[^h8085]:
###### 2
But your iniquities[^h5771] have separated[^h914] between[^h996] you and your God[^h430], and your sins[^h2403] have hid[^h5641] his face[^h6440] from you, that he will not hear[^h8085]. 
###### 3
For your hands[^h3709] are defiled[^h1351] with blood[^h1818], and your fingers[^h676] with iniquity[^h5771]; your lips[^h8193] have spoken[^h1696] lies[^h8267], your tongue[^h3956] hath muttered[^h1897] perverseness[^h5766].
###### 4
None calleth[^h7121] for justice[^h6664], nor any pleadeth[^h8199] for truth[^h530]: they trust[^h982] in vanity[^h8414], and speak[^h1696] lies[^h7723]; they conceive[^h2029] mischief[^h5999], and bring forth[^h3205] iniquity[^h205].
###### 5
They hatch[^h1234] cockatrice'[^h6848] eggs[^h1000], and weave[^h707] the spider's[^h5908] web[^h6980]: he that eateth[^h398] of their eggs[^h1000] dieth[^h4191], and that which is crushed[^h2116] breaketh out[^h1234] into a viper[^h660].  
###### 6
Their webs[^h6980] shall not become garments[^h899], neither shall they cover[^h3680] themselves with their works[^h4639]: their works[^h4639] are works[^h4639] of iniquity[^h205], and the act[^h6467] of violence[^h2555] is in their hands[^h3709].
###### 7
Their feet[^h7272] run[^h7323] to evil[^h7451], and they make haste[^h4116] to shed[^h8210] innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818]: their thoughts[^h4284] are thoughts[^h4284] of iniquity[^h205]; wasting[^h7701] and destruction[^h7667] are in their paths[^h4546]. 
###### 8
The way[^h1870] of peace[^h7965] they know[^h3045] not; and there is no judgment[^h4941] in their goings[^h4570]: they have made them crooked[^h6140] paths[^h5410]: whosoever goeth[^h1869] therein shall not know[^h3045] peace[^h7965]. 
###### 9
Therefore is judgment[^h4941] far[^h7368] from us, neither doth justice[^h6666] overtake[^h5381] us: we wait[^h6960] for light[^h216], but behold obscurity[^h2822]; for brightness[^h5054], but we walk[^h1980] in darkness[^h653].
###### 10
We grope[^h1659] for the wall[^h7023] like the blind[^h5787], and we grope[^h1659] as if we had no eyes[^h5869]: we stumble[^h3782] at noonday[^h6672] as in the night[^h5399]; we are in desolate[^h820] places as dead[^h4191] men.
###### 11
We roar[^h1993] all like bears[^h1677], and mourn[^h1897] sore[^h1897] like doves[^h3123]: we look[^h6960] for judgment[^h4941], but there is none; for salvation[^h3444], but it is far off[^h7368] from us.
###### 12
For our transgressions[^h6588] are multiplied[^h7231] before thee, and our sins[^h2403] testify[^h6030] against us: for our transgressions[^h6588] are with us; and as for our iniquities[^h5771], we know[^h3045] them;
###### 13
In transgressing[^h6586] and lying[^h3584] against the LORD[^h3068], and departing away[^h5253] from[^h310] our God[^h430], speaking[^h1696] oppression[^h6233] and revolt[^h5627], conceiving[^h2029] and uttering[^h1897] from the heart[^h3820] words[^h1697] of falsehood[^h8267].
###### 14
And judgment[^h4941] is turned away[^h5253] backward[^h268], and justice[^h6666] standeth[^h5975] afar off[^h7350]: for truth[^h571] is fallen[^h3782] in the street[^h7339], and equity[^h5229] cannot[^h3201] enter[^h935].
###### 15
Yea, truth[^h571] faileth[^h5737]; and he that departeth[^h5493] from evil[^h7451] maketh himself a prey[^h7997]: and the LORD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] it, and it displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] him that there was no judgment[^h4941].  
###### 16
And he saw[^h7200] that there was no man[^h376], and wondered[^h8074] that there was no intercessor[^h6293]: therefore his arm[^h2220] brought salvation[^h3467] unto him; and his righteousness[^h6666], it sustained[^h5564] him.
###### 17
For he put on[^h3847] righteousness[^h6666] as a breastplate[^h8302], and an helmet[^h3553] of salvation[^h3444] upon his head[^h7218]; and he put on[^h3847] the garments[^h899] of vengeance[^h5359] for clothing[^h8516], and was clad[^h5844] with zeal[^h7068] as a cloke[^h4598].
###### 18
According to[^h5921] their deeds[^h1578], accordingly he will repay[^h7999], fury[^h2534] to his adversaries[^h6862], recompence[^h1576] to his enemies[^h341]; to the islands[^h339] he will repay[^h7999] recompence[^h1576]. 
###### 19
So shall they fear[^h3372] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] from the west[^h4628], and his glory[^h3519] from the rising[^h4217] of the sun[^h8121]. When the enemy[^h6862] shall come in[^h935] like a flood[^h5104], the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] shall lift up a standard[^h5127] against him. 
###### 20
And the Redeemer[^h1350] shall come[^h935] to Zion[^h6726], and unto them that turn[^h7725] from transgression[^h6588] in Jacob[^h3290], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
As for me, this is my covenant[^h1285] with them, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; My spirit[^h7307] that is upon thee, and my words[^h1697] which I have put[^h7760] in thy mouth[^h6310], shall not depart[^h4185] out of thy mouth[^h6310], nor out of the mouth[^h6310] of thy seed[^h2233], nor out of the mouth[^h6310] of thy seed's[^h2233] seed[^h2233], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], from henceforth and for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].

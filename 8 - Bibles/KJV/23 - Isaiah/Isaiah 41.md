###### 1
Keep silence[^h2790] before me, O islands[^h339]; and let the people[^h3816] renew[^h2498] their strength[^h3581]: let them come near[^h5066]; then let them speak[^h1696]: let us come near[^h7126] together[^h3162] to judgment[^h4941].
###### 2
Who raised up[^h5782] the righteous[^h6664] man from the east[^h4217], called[^h7121] him to his foot[^h7272], gave[^h5414] the nations[^h1471] before[^h6440] him, and made him rule[^h7287] over kings[^h4428]? he gave[^h5414] them as the dust[^h6083] to his sword[^h2719], and as driven[^h5086] stubble[^h7179] to his bow[^h7198]. 
###### 3
He pursued[^h7291] them, and passed[^h5674] safely[^h7965]; even by the way[^h734] that he had not gone[^h935] with his feet[^h7272]. 
###### 4
Who hath wrought[^h6466] and done[^h6213] it, calling[^h7121] the generations[^h1755] from the beginning[^h7218]? I the LORD[^h3068], the first[^h7223], and with the last[^h314]; I am he.
###### 5
The isles[^h339] saw[^h7200] it, and feared[^h3372]; the ends[^h7098] of the earth[^h776] were afraid[^h2729], drew near[^h7126], and came[^h857].
###### 6
They helped[^h5826] every one[^h376] his neighbour[^h7453]; and every one said[^h559] to his brother[^h251], Be of good courage[^h2388]. 
###### 7
So the carpenter[^h2796] encouraged[^h2388] the goldsmith[^h6884], and he that smootheth[^h2505] with the hammer[^h6360] him that smote[^h1986] the anvil[^h6471], saying[^h559], It is ready[^h2896] for the sodering[^h1694]: and he fastened[^h2388] it with nails[^h4548], that it should not be moved[^h4131].   
###### 8
But thou, Israel[^h3478], art my servant[^h5650], Jacob[^h3290] whom I have chosen[^h977], the seed[^h2233] of Abraham[^h85] my friend[^h157].
###### 9
Thou whom I have taken[^h2388] from the ends[^h7098] of the earth[^h776], and called[^h7121] thee from the chief men[^h678] thereof, and said[^h559] unto thee, Thou art my servant[^h5650]; I have chosen[^h977] thee, and not cast thee away[^h3988].
###### 10
Fear[^h3372] thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed[^h8159]; for I am thy God[^h430]: I will strengthen[^h553] thee; yea, I will help[^h5826] thee; yea, I will uphold[^h8551] thee with the right hand[^h3225] of my righteousness[^h6664].
###### 11
Behold, all they that were incensed[^h2734] against thee shall be ashamed[^h954] and confounded[^h3637]: they shall be as nothing; and they[^h582] that strive[^h7379] with thee shall perish[^h6]. 
###### 12
Thou shalt seek[^h1245] them, and shalt not find[^h4672] them, even them[^h582] that contended[^h4695] with thee: they that war[^h4421] against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought[^h657].  
###### 13
For I the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will hold[^h2388] thy right hand[^h3225], saying[^h559] unto thee, Fear[^h3372] not; I will help[^h5826] thee.
###### 14
Fear[^h3372] not, thou worm[^h8438] Jacob[^h3290], and ye men[^h4962] of Israel[^h3478]; I will help[^h5826] thee, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and thy redeemer[^h1350], the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 15
Behold, I will make[^h7760] thee a new[^h2319] sharp[^h2742] threshing[^h4173] instrument having[^h1167] teeth[^h6374]: thou shalt thresh[^h1758] the mountains[^h2022], and beat them small[^h1854], and shalt make[^h7760] the hills[^h1389] as chaff[^h4671]. 
###### 16
Thou shalt fan[^h2219] them, and the wind[^h7307] shall carry them away[^h5375], and the whirlwind[^h5591] shall scatter[^h6327] them: and thou shalt rejoice[^h1523] in the LORD[^h3068], and shalt glory[^h1984] in the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 17
When the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34] seek[^h1245] water[^h4325], and there is none, and their tongue[^h3956] faileth[^h5405] for thirst[^h6772], I the LORD[^h3068] will hear[^h6030] them, I the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] will not forsake[^h5800] them.
###### 18
I will open[^h6605] rivers[^h5104] in high places[^h8205], and fountains[^h4599] in the midst[^h8432] of the valleys[^h1237]: I will make[^h7760] the wilderness[^h4057] a pool[^h98] of water[^h4325], and the dry[^h6723] land[^h776] springs[^h4161] of water[^h4325].
###### 19
I will plant[^h5414] in the wilderness[^h4057] the cedar[^h730], the shittah tree[^h7848], and the myrtle[^h1918], and the oil[^h8081] tree[^h6086]; I will set[^h7760] in the desert[^h6160] the fir tree[^h1265], and the pine[^h8410], and the box tree[^h8391] together[^h3162]:
###### 20
That they may see[^h7200], and know[^h3045], and consider[^h7760], and understand[^h7919] together[^h3162], that the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] hath done[^h6213] this, and the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478] hath created[^h1254] it.
###### 21
Produce[^h7126] your cause[^h7379], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; bring forth[^h5066] your strong[^h6110] reasons, saith[^h559] the King[^h4428] of Jacob[^h3290]. 
###### 22
Let them bring them forth[^h5066], and shew[^h5046] us what shall happen[^h7136]: let them shew[^h5046] the former things[^h7223], what they be, that we may consider[^h7760] [^h3820] them, and know[^h3045] the latter end[^h319] of them; or declare[^h8085] us things for to come[^h935]. 
###### 23
Shew[^h5046] the things that are to come[^h857] hereafter[^h268], that we may know[^h3045] that ye are gods[^h430]: yea, do good[^h3190], or do evil[^h7489], that we may be dismayed[^h8159], and behold[^h7200] it together[^h3162].
###### 24
Behold, ye are of nothing[^h369], and your work[^h6467] of nought[^h659]: an abomination[^h8441] is he that chooseth[^h977] you.  
###### 25
I have raised up[^h5782] one from the north[^h6828], and he shall come[^h857]: from the rising[^h4217] of the sun[^h8121] shall he call[^h7121] upon my name[^h8034]: and he shall come[^h935] upon princes[^h5461] as upon morter[^h2563], and as the potter[^h3335] treadeth[^h7429] clay[^h2916].
###### 26
Who hath declared[^h5046] from the beginning[^h7218], that we may know[^h3045]? and beforetime[^h6440], that we may say[^h559], He is righteous[^h6662]? yea, there is none that sheweth[^h5046], yea, there is none that declareth[^h8085], yea, there is none that heareth[^h8085] your words[^h561].
###### 27
The first[^h7223] shall say to Zion[^h6726], Behold[^h2009], behold[^h2009] them: and I will give[^h5414] to Jerusalem[^h3389] one that bringeth good tidings[^h1319].
###### 28
For I beheld[^h7200], and there was no man[^h376]; even among them, and there was no counsellor[^h3289], that, when I asked[^h7592] of them, could answer[^h7725] a word[^h1697]. 
###### 29
Behold, they are all vanity[^h205]; their works[^h4639] are nothing[^h657]: their molten images[^h5262] are wind[^h7307] and confusion[^h8414].

###### 1
Woe[^h1945] unto them that decree[^h2710] unrighteous[^h205] decrees[^h2711], and that write[^h3789] grievousness[^h5999] which they have prescribed[^h3789]; 
###### 2
To turn aside[^h5186] the needy[^h1800] from judgment[^h1779], and to take away[^h1497] the right[^h4941] from the poor[^h6041] of my people[^h5971], that widows[^h490] may be their prey[^h7998], and that they may rob[^h962] the fatherless[^h3490]!
###### 3
And what will ye do[^h6213] in the day[^h3117] of visitation[^h6486], and in the desolation[^h7722] which shall come[^h935] from far[^h4801]? to whom will ye flee[^h5127] for help[^h5833]? and where will ye leave[^h5800] your glory[^h3519]?
###### 4
Without me they shall[^h1115] bow down[^h3766] under the prisoners[^h616], and they shall fall[^h5307] under the slain[^h2026]. For all this his anger[^h639] is not turned away[^h7725], but his hand[^h3027] is stretched out still[^h5186].
###### 5
O[^h1945] Assyrian[^h804], the rod[^h7626] of mine anger[^h639], and the staff[^h4294] in their hand[^h3027] is mine indignation[^h2195].  
###### 6
I will send[^h7971] him against an hypocritical[^h2611] nation[^h1471], and against the people[^h5971] of my wrath[^h5678] will I give him a charge[^h6680], to take[^h7997] the spoil[^h7998], and to take[^h962] the prey[^h957], and to tread them down[^h7760] [^h4823] like the mire[^h2563] of the streets[^h2351]. 
###### 7
Howbeit he meaneth[^h1819] not so, neither doth his heart[^h3824] think[^h2803] so; but it is in his heart[^h3824] to destroy[^h8045] and cut off[^h3772] nations[^h1471] not a few[^h4592].
###### 8
For he saith[^h559], Are not my princes[^h8269] altogether[^h3162] kings[^h4428]?
###### 9
Is not Calno[^h3641] as Carchemish[^h3751]? is not Hamath[^h2574] as Arpad[^h774]? is not Samaria[^h8111] as Damascus[^h1834]?
###### 10
As my hand[^h3027] hath found[^h4672] the kingdoms[^h4467] of the idols[^h457], and whose graven images[^h6456] did excel them of Jerusalem[^h3389] and of Samaria[^h8111];
###### 11
Shall I not, as I have done[^h6213] unto Samaria[^h8111] and her idols[^h457], so do[^h6213] to Jerusalem[^h3389] and her idols[^h6091]?
###### 12
Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord[^h136] hath performed[^h1214] his whole work[^h4639] upon mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726] and on Jerusalem[^h3389], I will punish[^h6485] the fruit[^h6529] of the stout[^h1433] heart[^h3824] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], and the glory[^h8597] of his high[^h7312] looks[^h5869].  
###### 13
For he saith[^h559], By the strength[^h3581] of my hand[^h3027] I have done[^h6213] it, and by my wisdom[^h2451]; for I am prudent[^h995]: and I have removed[^h5493] the bounds[^h1367] of the people[^h5971], and have robbed[^h8154] their treasures[^h6259] [^h6264], and I have put down[^h3381] the inhabitants[^h3427] like a valiant[^h47] [^h3524] man: 
###### 14
And my hand[^h3027] hath found[^h4672] as a nest[^h7064] the riches[^h2428] of the people[^h5971]: and as one gathereth[^h622] eggs[^h1000] that are left[^h5800], have I gathered[^h622] all the earth[^h776]; and there was none that moved[^h5074] the wing[^h3671], or opened[^h6475] the mouth[^h6310], or peeped[^h6850].
###### 15
Shall the axe[^h1631] boast[^h6286] itself against him that heweth[^h2672] therewith? or shall the saw[^h4883] magnify[^h1431] itself against him that shaketh[^h5130] it? as if the rod[^h7626] should shake[^h5130] itself against them that lift it up[^h7311], or as if the staff[^h4294] should lift up[^h7311] itself, as if it were no wood[^h6086].  
###### 16
Therefore shall the Lord[^h113], the Lord[^h136] [^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], send[^h7971] among his fat ones[^h4924] leanness[^h7332]; and under his glory[^h3519] he shall kindle[^h3344] a burning[^h3350] like the burning of a fire[^h784].
###### 17
And the light[^h216] of Israel[^h3478] shall be for a fire[^h784], and his Holy One[^h6918] for a flame[^h3852]: and it shall burn[^h1197] and devour[^h398] his thorns[^h7898] and his briers[^h8068] in one[^h259] day[^h3117];
###### 18
And shall consume[^h3615] the glory[^h3519] of his forest[^h3293], and of his fruitful field[^h3759], both soul[^h5315] and body[^h1320]: and they shall be as when a standardbearer[^h5263] fainteth[^h4549]. 
###### 19
And the rest[^h7605] of the trees[^h6086] of his forest[^h3293] shall be few[^h4557], that a child[^h5288] may write[^h3789] them. 
###### 20
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that the remnant[^h7605] of Israel[^h3478], and such as are escaped[^h6413] of the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], shall no more again[^h3254] stay[^h8172] upon him that smote[^h5221] them; but shall stay[^h8172] upon the LORD[^h3068], the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478], in truth[^h571].
###### 21
The remnant[^h7605] shall return[^h7725], even the remnant[^h7605] of Jacob[^h3290], unto the mighty[^h1368] God[^h410].
###### 22
For though thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] be as the sand[^h2344] of the sea[^h3220], yet a remnant[^h7605] of them shall return[^h7725]: the consumption[^h3631] decreed[^h2782] shall overflow[^h7857] with righteousness[^h6666].  
###### 23
For the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of hosts[^h6635] shall make[^h6213] a consumption[^h3617], even determined[^h2782], in the midst[^h7130] of all the land[^h776].
###### 24
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of hosts[^h6635], O my people[^h5971] that dwellest[^h3427] in Zion[^h6726], be not afraid[^h3372] of the Assyrian[^h804]: he shall smite[^h5221] thee with a rod[^h7626], and shall lift up[^h5375] his staff[^h4294] against thee, after the manner[^h1870] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 25
For yet a very[^h4213] little while[^h4592], and the indignation[^h2195] shall cease[^h3615], and mine anger[^h639] in their destruction[^h8399].
###### 26
And the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] shall stir up[^h5782] a scourge[^h7752] for him according to the slaughter[^h4347] of Midian[^h4080] at the rock[^h6697] of Oreb[^h6159]: and as his rod[^h4294] was upon the sea[^h3220], so shall he lift it up[^h5375] after the manner[^h1870] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 27
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that his burden[^h5448] shall be taken away[^h5493] from off thy shoulder[^h7926], and his yoke[^h5923] from off thy neck[^h6677], and the yoke[^h5923] shall be destroyed[^h2254] because[^h6440] of the anointing[^h8081]. 
###### 28
He is come[^h935] to Aiath[^h5857], he is passed[^h5674] to Migron[^h4051]; at Michmash[^h4363] he hath laid up[^h6485] his carriages[^h3627]:
###### 29
They are gone over[^h5674] the passage[^h4569]: they have taken up their lodging[^h4411] at Geba[^h1387]; Ramah[^h7414] is afraid[^h2729]; Gibeah[^h1390] of Saul[^h7586] is fled[^h5127].
###### 30
Lift up[^h6670] thy voice[^h6963], O daughter[^h1323] of[^h1530] Gallim[^h1554]: cause it to be heard[^h7181] unto Laish[^h3919], O poor[^h6041] Anathoth[^h6068]. 
###### 31
Madmenah[^h4088] is removed[^h5074]; the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gebim[^h1374] gather themselves to flee[^h5756].
###### 32
As yet shall he remain[^h5975] at Nob[^h5011] that day[^h3117]: he shall shake[^h5130] his hand[^h3027] against the mount[^h2022] of the daughter[^h1323] [^h1004] of Zion[^h6726], the hill[^h1389] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 33
Behold, the Lord[^h113], the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], shall lop[^h5586] the bough[^h6288] with terror[^h4637]: and the high ones[^h7311] of stature[^h6967] shall be hewn down[^h1438], and the haughty[^h1364] shall be humbled[^h8213].
###### 34
And he shall cut down[^h5362] the thickets[^h5442] of the forest[^h3293] with iron[^h1270], and Lebanon[^h3844] shall fall[^h5307] by a mighty one[^h117].

###### 1
Who is this that cometh[^h935] from Edom[^h123], with dyed[^h2556] garments[^h899] from Bozrah[^h1224]? this that is glorious[^h1921] in his apparel[^h3830], travelling[^h6808] in the greatness[^h7230] of his strength[^h3581]? I that speak[^h1696] in righteousness[^h6666], mighty[^h7227] to save[^h3467]. 
###### 2
Wherefore art thou red[^h122] in thine apparel[^h3830], and thy garments[^h899] like him that treadeth[^h1869] in the winefat[^h1660]?
###### 3
I have trodden[^h1869] the winepress[^h6333] alone; and of the people[^h5971] there was none[^h376] with me: for I will tread[^h1869] them in mine anger[^h639], and trample[^h7429] them in my fury[^h2534]; and their blood[^h5332] shall be sprinkled[^h5137] upon my garments[^h899], and I will stain[^h1351] all my raiment[^h4403].
###### 4
For the day[^h3117] of vengeance[^h5359] is in mine heart[^h3820], and the year[^h8141] of my redeemed[^h1350] is come[^h935].
###### 5
And I looked[^h5027], and there was none to help[^h5826]; and I wondered[^h8074] that there was none to uphold[^h5564]: therefore mine own arm[^h2220] brought salvation[^h3467] unto me; and my fury[^h2534], it upheld[^h5564] me.
###### 6
And I will tread down[^h947] the people[^h5971] in mine anger[^h639], and make them drunk[^h7937] in my fury[^h2534], and I will bring down[^h3381] their strength[^h5332] to the earth[^h776].
###### 7
I will mention[^h2142] the lovingkindnesses[^h2617] of the LORD[^h3068], and the praises[^h8416] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that the LORD[^h3068] hath bestowed[^h1580] on us, and the great[^h7227] goodness[^h2898] toward the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], which he hath bestowed[^h1580] on them according to his mercies[^h7356], and according to the multitude[^h7230] of his lovingkindnesses[^h2617].
###### 8
For he said[^h559], Surely they are my people[^h5971], children[^h1121] that will not lie[^h8266]: so he was their Saviour[^h3467].
###### 9
In all their affliction[^h6869] he was afflicted[^h6862], and the angel[^h4397] of his presence[^h6440] saved[^h3467] them: in his love[^h160] and in his pity[^h2551] he redeemed[^h1350] them; and he bare[^h5190] them, and carried[^h5375] them all the days[^h3117] of old[^h5769].
###### 10
But they rebelled[^h4784], and vexed[^h6087] his holy[^h6944] Spirit[^h7307]: therefore he was turned[^h2015] to be their enemy[^h341], and he fought[^h3898] against them.
###### 11
Then he remembered[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of old[^h5769], Moses[^h4872], and his people[^h5971], saying, Where is he that brought them up[^h5927] out of the sea[^h3220] with the shepherd[^h7462] of his flock[^h6629]? where is he that put[^h7760] his holy[^h6944] Spirit[^h7307] within[^h7130] him? 
###### 12
That led[^h3212] them by the right hand[^h3225] of Moses[^h4872] with his glorious[^h8597] arm[^h2220], dividing[^h1234] the water[^h4325] before[^h6440] them, to make[^h6213] himself an everlasting[^h5769] name[^h8034]?
###### 13
That led[^h3212] them through the deep[^h8415], as an horse[^h5483] in the wilderness[^h4057], that they should not stumble[^h3782]?
###### 14
As a beast[^h929] goeth down[^h3381] into the valley[^h1237], the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] caused him to rest[^h5117]: so didst thou lead[^h5090] thy people[^h5971], to make[^h6213] thyself a glorious[^h8597] name[^h8034].
###### 15
Look down[^h5027] from heaven[^h8064], and behold[^h7200] from the habitation[^h2073] of thy holiness[^h6944] and of thy glory[^h8597]: where is thy zeal[^h7068] and thy strength[^h1369], the sounding[^h1995] of thy bowels[^h4578] and of thy mercies[^h7356] toward me? are they restrained[^h662]? 
###### 16
Doubtless[^h3588] thou art our father[^h1], though Abraham[^h85] be ignorant[^h3808] [^h3045] of us, and Israel[^h3478] acknowledge[^h5234] us not: thou, O LORD[^h3068], art our father[^h1], our redeemer[^h1350]; thy name[^h8034] is from everlasting[^h5769]. 
###### 17
O LORD[^h3068], why hast thou made us to err[^h8582] from thy ways[^h1870], and hardened[^h7188] our heart[^h3820] from thy fear[^h3374]? Return[^h7725] for thy servants'[^h5650] sake, the tribes[^h7626] of thine inheritance[^h5159].
###### 18
The people[^h5971] of thy holiness[^h6944] have possessed[^h3423] it but a little while[^h4705]: our adversaries[^h6862] have trodden down[^h947] thy sanctuary[^h4720].
###### 19
We are thine: thou never[^h5769] barest rule[^h4910] over them; they were not called[^h7121] by thy name[^h8034].

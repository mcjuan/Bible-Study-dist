###### 1
And it came to pass, when king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396] heard[^h8085] it, that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], and covered[^h3680] himself with sackcloth[^h8242], and went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 2
And he sent[^h7971] Eliakim[^h471], who was over the household[^h1004], and Shebna[^h7644] the scribe[^h5608], and the elders[^h2205] of the priests[^h3548] covered[^h3680] with sackcloth[^h8242], unto Isaiah[^h3470] the prophet[^h5030] the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531].
###### 3
And they said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] Hezekiah[^h2396], This day[^h3117] is a day[^h3117] of trouble[^h6869], and of rebuke[^h8433], and of blasphemy[^h5007]: for the children[^h1121] are come[^h935] to the birth[^h4866], and there is not strength[^h3581] to bring forth[^h3205]. 
###### 4
It may be the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of Rabshakeh[^h7262], whom the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] his master[^h113] hath sent[^h7971] to reproach[^h2778] the living[^h2416] God[^h430], and will reprove[^h3198] the words[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath heard[^h8085]: wherefore lift up[^h5375] thy prayer[^h8605] for the remnant[^h7611] that is left[^h4672]. 
###### 5
So the servants[^h5650] of king[^h4428] Hezekiah[^h2396] came[^h935] to Isaiah[^h3470].
###### 6
And Isaiah[^h3470] said[^h559] unto them, Thus shall ye say[^h559] unto your master[^h113], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Be not afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] the words[^h1697] that thou hast heard[^h8085], wherewith the servants[^h5288] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] have blasphemed[^h1442] me.
###### 7
Behold, I will send[^h5414] a blast[^h7307] upon him, and he shall hear[^h8085] a rumour[^h8052], and return[^h7725] to his own land[^h776]; and I will cause him to fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719] in his own land[^h776]. 
###### 8
So Rabshakeh[^h7262] returned[^h7725], and found[^h4672] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] warring[^h3898] against Libnah[^h3841]: for he had heard[^h8085] that he was departed[^h5265] from Lachish[^h3923].
###### 9
And he heard[^h8085] say[^h559] concerning Tirhakah[^h8640] king[^h4428] of Ethiopia[^h3568], He is come forth[^h3318] to make war[^h3898] with thee. And when he heard[^h8085] it, he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to Hezekiah[^h2396], saying[^h559],
###### 10
Thus shall ye speak[^h559] to Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], Let not thy God[^h430], in whom thou trustest[^h982], deceive[^h5377] thee, saying[^h559], Jerusalem[^h3389] shall not be given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804].
###### 11
Behold, thou hast heard[^h8085] what the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] have done[^h6213] to all lands[^h776] by destroying them utterly[^h2763]; and shalt thou be delivered[^h5337]?
###### 12
Have the gods[^h430] of the nations[^h1471] delivered[^h5337] them which my fathers[^h1] have destroyed[^h7843], as Gozan[^h1470], and Haran[^h2771], and Rezeph[^h7530], and the children[^h1121] of Eden[^h5729] which were in Telassar[^h8515]?
###### 13
Where is the king[^h4428] of Hamath[^h2574], and the king[^h4428] of Arphad[^h774], and the king[^h4428] of the city[^h5892] of Sepharvaim[^h5617], Hena[^h2012], and Ivah[^h5755]?
###### 14
And Hezekiah[^h2396] received[^h3947] the letter[^h5612] from the hand[^h3027] of the messengers[^h4397], and read[^h7121] it: and Hezekiah[^h2396] went up[^h5927] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and spread[^h6566] it before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
And Hezekiah[^h2396] prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 16
O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], that dwellest[^h3427] between the cherubims[^h3742], thou art the God[^h430], even thou alone, of all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776]: thou hast made[^h6213] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776].
###### 17
Incline[^h5186] thine ear[^h241], O LORD[^h3068], and hear[^h8085]; open[^h6491] thine eyes[^h5869], O LORD[^h3068], and see[^h7200]: and hear[^h8085] all the words[^h1697] of Sennacherib[^h5576], which hath sent[^h7971] to reproach[^h2778] the living[^h2416] God[^h430].
###### 18
Of a truth[^h551], LORD[^h3068], the kings[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] have laid waste[^h2717] all the nations[^h776], and their countries[^h776], 
###### 19
And have cast[^h5414] their gods[^h430] into the fire[^h784]: for they were no gods[^h430], but the work[^h4639] of men's[^h120] hands[^h3027], wood[^h6086] and stone[^h68]: therefore they have destroyed[^h6] them. 
###### 20
Now therefore, O LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], save[^h3467] us from his hand[^h3027], that all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776] may know[^h3045] that thou art the LORD[^h3068], even thou only.
###### 21
Then Isaiah[^h3470] the son[^h1121] of Amoz[^h531] sent[^h7971] unto Hezekiah[^h2396], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Whereas thou hast prayed[^h6419] to me against Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804]:
###### 22
This is the word[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] concerning him; The virgin[^h1330], the daughter[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726], hath despised[^h959] thee, and laughed thee to scorn;[^h3932] the daughter[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389] hath shaken[^h5128] her head[^h7218] at thee[^h310].
###### 23
Whom hast thou reproached[^h2778] and blasphemed[^h1442]? and against whom hast thou exalted[^h7311] thy voice[^h6963], and lifted up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] on high[^h4791]? even against the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
By[^h3027] thy servants[^h5650] hast thou reproached[^h2778] the Lord[^h136], and hast said[^h559], By the multitude[^h7230] of my chariots[^h7393] am I come up[^h5927] to the height[^h4791] of the mountains[^h2022], to the sides[^h3411] of Lebanon[^h3844]; and I will cut down[^h3772] the tall[^h6967] cedars[^h730] thereof, and the choice[^h4005] fir trees[^h1265] thereof: and I will enter[^h935] into the height[^h4791] of his border[^h7093], and the forest[^h3293] of his Carmel[^h3760].   
###### 25
I have digged[^h6979], and drunk[^h8354] water[^h4325]; and with the sole[^h3709] of my feet[^h6471] have I dried up[^h2717] all the rivers[^h2975] of the besieged places[^h4693]. 
###### 26
Hast thou not heard[^h8085] long ago[^h7350], how I have done[^h6213] it; and of ancient[^h6924] times[^h3117], that I have formed[^h3335] it? now have I brought[^h935] it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste[^h7582] defenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892] into ruinous[^h5327] heaps[^h1530]. 
###### 27
Therefore their inhabitants[^h3427] were of small[^h7116] power[^h3027], they were dismayed[^h2865] and confounded[^h954]: they were as the grass[^h6212] of the field[^h7704], and as the green[^h3419] herb[^h1877], as the grass[^h2682] on the housetops[^h1406], and as corn blasted[^h7709] before[^h6440] it be grown up[^h7054]. 
###### 28
But I know[^h3045] thy abode[^h3427], and thy going out[^h3318], and thy coming in[^h935], and thy rage[^h7264] against me. 
###### 29
Because thy rage[^h7264] against me, and thy tumult[^h7600], is come up[^h5927] into mine ears[^h241], therefore will I put[^h7760] my hook[^h2397] in thy nose[^h639], and my bridle[^h4964] in thy lips[^h8193], and I will turn thee back[^h7725] by the way[^h1870] by which thou camest[^h935].
###### 30
And this shall be a sign[^h226] unto thee, Ye shall eat[^h398] this year[^h8141] such as groweth[^h5599] of itself; and the second[^h8145] year[^h8141] that which springeth[^h7823] of the same: and in the third[^h7992] year[^h8141] sow[^h2232] ye, and reap[^h7114], and plant[^h5193] vineyards[^h3754], and eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] thereof.
###### 31
And the remnant[^h7604] that is escaped[^h6413] of the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] shall again[^h3254] take root[^h8328] downward[^h4295], and bear[^h6213] fruit[^h6529] upward[^h4605]: 
###### 32
For out of Jerusalem[^h3389] shall go forth[^h3318] a remnant[^h7611], and they that escape[^h6413] out of mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726]: the zeal[^h7068] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] shall do[^h6213] this. 
###### 33
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] concerning the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804], He shall not come[^h935] into this city[^h5892], nor shoot[^h3384] an arrow[^h2671] there, nor come before[^h6923] it with shields[^h4043], nor cast[^h8210] a bank[^h5550] against it.
###### 34
By the way[^h1870] that he came[^h935], by the same shall he return[^h7725], and shall not come[^h935] into this city[^h5892], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 35
For I will defend[^h1598] this city[^h5892] to save[^h3467] it for mine own sake, and for my servant[^h5650] David's[^h1732] sake.
###### 36
Then the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] went forth[^h3318], and smote[^h5221] in the camp[^h4264] of the Assyrians[^h804] a hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] and five[^h2568] thousand[^h505]: and when they arose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], behold, they were all dead[^h4191] corpses[^h6297].
###### 37
So Sennacherib[^h5576] king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] departed[^h5265], and went[^h3212] and returned[^h7725], and dwelt[^h3427] at Nineveh[^h5210].
###### 38
And it came to pass, as he was worshipping[^h7812] in the house[^h1004] of Nisroch[^h5268] his god[^h430], that Adrammelech[^h152] and Sharezer[^h8272] his sons[^h1121] smote[^h5221] him with the sword[^h2719]; and they escaped[^h4422] into the land[^h776] of Armenia[^h780]: and Esarhaddon[^h634] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

###### 1
Comfort[^h5162] ye, comfort[^h5162] ye my people[^h5971], saith[^h559] your God[^h430].
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] ye comfortably[^h3820] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and cry[^h7121] unto her, that her warfare[^h6635] is accomplished[^h4390], that her iniquity[^h5771] is pardoned[^h7521]: for she hath received[^h3947] of the LORD'S[^h3068] hand[^h3027] double[^h3718] for all her sins[^h2403].  
###### 3
The voice[^h6963] of him that crieth[^h7121] in the wilderness[^h4057], Prepare[^h6437] ye the way[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068], make straight[^h3474] in the desert[^h6160] a highway[^h4546] for our God[^h430].
###### 4
Every valley[^h1516] shall be exalted[^h5375], and every mountain[^h2022] and hill[^h1389] shall be made low[^h8213]: and the crooked[^h6121] shall be made straight[^h4334], and the rough places[^h7406] plain[^h1237]:  
###### 5
And the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] shall be revealed[^h1540], and all flesh[^h1320] shall see[^h7200] it together[^h3162]: for the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 6
The voice[^h6963] said[^h559], Cry[^h7121]. And he said[^h559], What shall I cry[^h7121]? All flesh[^h1320] is grass[^h2682], and all the goodliness[^h2617] thereof is as the flower[^h6731] of the field[^h7704]:
###### 7
The grass[^h2682] withereth[^h3001], the flower[^h6731] fadeth[^h5034]: because the spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] bloweth[^h5380] upon it: surely[^h403] the people[^h5971] is grass[^h2682].
###### 8
The grass[^h2682] withereth[^h3001], the flower[^h6731] fadeth[^h5034]: but the word[^h1697] of our God[^h430] shall stand[^h6965] for ever[^h5769].
###### 9
O Zion[^h6726], that bringest good tidings[^h1319], get thee up[^h5927] into the high[^h1364] mountain[^h2022]; O Jerusalem[^h3389], that bringest good tidings[^h1319], lift up[^h7311] thy voice[^h6963] with strength[^h3581]; lift it up[^h7311], be not afraid[^h3372]; say[^h559] unto the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], Behold your God[^h430]!  
###### 10
Behold, the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] will come[^h935] with strong[^h2389] hand, and his arm[^h2220] shall rule[^h4910] for him: behold, his reward[^h7939] is with him, and his work[^h6468] before[^h6440] him.  
###### 11
He shall feed[^h7462] his flock[^h5739] like a shepherd[^h7462]: he shall gather[^h6908] the lambs[^h2922] with his arm[^h2220], and carry[^h5375] them in his bosom[^h2436], and shall gently lead[^h5095] those that are with young[^h5763]. 
###### 12
Who hath measured[^h4058] the waters[^h4325] in the hollow of his hand[^h8168], and meted out[^h8505] heaven[^h8064] with the span[^h2239], and comprehended[^h3557] the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776] in a measure[^h7991], and weighed[^h8254] the mountains[^h2022] in scales[^h6425], and the hills[^h1389] in a balance[^h3976]? 
###### 13
Who hath directed[^h8505] the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068], or being his counsellor[^h376] [^h6098] hath taught[^h3045] him? 
###### 14
With whom took he counsel[^h3289], and who instructed[^h995] him, and taught[^h3925] him in the path[^h734] of judgment[^h4941], and taught[^h3925] him knowledge[^h1847], and shewed[^h3045] to him the way[^h1870] of understanding[^h8394]?  
###### 15
Behold, the nations[^h1471] are as a drop[^h4752] of a bucket[^h1805], and are counted[^h2803] as the small dust[^h7834] of the balance[^h3976]: behold, he taketh up[^h5190] the isles[^h339] as a very little thing[^h1851].
###### 16
And Lebanon[^h3844] is not[^h369] sufficient[^h1767] to burn[^h1197], nor the beasts[^h2416] thereof sufficient[^h1767] for a burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 17
All nations[^h1471] before him are as nothing; and they are counted[^h2803] to him less than nothing[^h657], and vanity[^h8414].
###### 18
To whom then will ye liken[^h1819] God[^h410]? or what likeness[^h1823] will ye compare[^h6186] unto him?
###### 19
The workman[^h2796] melteth[^h5258] a graven image[^h6459], and the goldsmith[^h6884] spreadeth[^h7554] it over with gold[^h2091], and casteth[^h6884] silver[^h3701] chains[^h7577].
###### 20
He that is so impoverished[^h5533] [^h5534] that he hath no oblation[^h8641] chooseth[^h977] a tree[^h6086] that will not rot[^h7537]; he seeketh[^h1245] unto him a cunning[^h2450] workman[^h2796] to prepare[^h3559] a graven image[^h6459], that shall not be moved[^h4131]. 
###### 21
Have ye not known[^h3045]? have ye not heard[^h8085]? hath it not been told[^h5046] you from the beginning[^h7218]? have ye not understood[^h995] from the foundations[^h4146] of the earth[^h776]?
###### 22
It is he that sitteth[^h3427] upon the circle[^h2329] of the earth[^h776], and the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof are as grasshoppers[^h2284]; that stretcheth out[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064] as a curtain[^h1852], and spreadeth them out[^h4969] as a tent[^h168] to dwell in[^h3427]: 
###### 23
That bringeth[^h5414] the princes[^h7336] to nothing; he maketh[^h6213] the judges[^h8199] of the earth[^h776] as vanity[^h8414].
###### 24
Yea, they shall not be planted[^h5193]; yea, they shall not be sown[^h2232]: yea, their stock[^h1503] shall not take root[^h8327] in the earth[^h776]: and he shall also blow[^h5398] upon them, and they shall wither[^h3001], and the whirlwind[^h5591] shall take[^h5375] them away as stubble[^h7179].
###### 25
To whom then will ye liken[^h1819] me, or shall I be equal[^h7737]? saith[^h559] the Holy One[^h6918].
###### 26
Lift up[^h5375] your eyes[^h5869] on high[^h4791], and behold[^h7200] who hath created[^h1254] these things, that bringeth out[^h3318] their host[^h6635] by number[^h4557]: he calleth[^h7121] them all by names[^h8034] by the greatness[^h7230] of his might[^h202], for that he is strong[^h533] in power[^h3581]; not one[^h376] faileth[^h5737].
###### 27
Why sayest[^h559] thou, O Jacob[^h3290], and speakest[^h1696], O Israel[^h3478], My way[^h1870] is hid[^h5641] from the LORD[^h3068], and my judgment[^h4941] is passed over[^h5674] from my God[^h430]?
###### 28
Hast thou not known[^h3045]? hast thou not heard[^h8085], that the everlasting[^h5769] God[^h430], the LORD[^h3068], the Creator[^h1254] of the ends[^h7098] of the earth[^h776], fainteth[^h3286] not, neither is weary[^h3021]? there is no searching[^h2714] of his understanding[^h8394].
###### 29
He giveth[^h5414] power[^h3581] to the faint[^h3287]; and to them that have no might[^h202] he increaseth[^h7235] strength[^h6109].
###### 30
Even the youths[^h5288] shall faint[^h3286] and be weary[^h3021], and the young men[^h970] shall utterly[^h3782] fall[^h3782]:
###### 31
But they that wait[^h6960] upon the LORD[^h3068] shall renew[^h2498] their strength[^h3581]; they shall mount up[^h5927] with wings[^h83] as eagles[^h5404]; they shall run[^h7323], and not be weary[^h3021]; and they shall walk[^h3212], and not faint[^h3286].

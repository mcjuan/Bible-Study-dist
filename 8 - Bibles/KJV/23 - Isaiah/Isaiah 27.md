###### 1
In that day[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] with his sore[^h7186] and great[^h1419] and strong[^h2389] sword[^h2719] shall punish[^h6485] leviathan[^h3882] the piercing[^h1281] serpent[^h5175], even leviathan[^h3882] that crooked[^h6129] serpent[^h5175]; and he shall slay[^h2026] the dragon[^h8577] that is in the sea[^h3220]. 
###### 2
In that day[^h3117] sing[^h6031] ye unto her, A vineyard[^h3754] of red wine[^h2561] [^h2531].
###### 3
I the LORD[^h3068] do keep[^h5341] it; I will water[^h8248] it every moment[^h7281]: lest any hurt[^h6485] it, I will keep[^h5341] it night[^h3915] and day[^h3117].
###### 4
Fury[^h2534] is not in me: who would set[^h5414] the briers[^h8068] and thorns[^h7898] against me in battle[^h4421]? I would go[^h6585] through them, I would burn[^h6702] them together[^h3162]. 
###### 5
Or let him take hold[^h2388] of my strength[^h4581], that he may make[^h6213] peace[^h7965] with me; and he shall make[^h6213] peace[^h7965] with me.
###### 6
He shall cause them that come[^h935] of Jacob[^h3290] to take root[^h8327]: Israel[^h3478] shall blossom[^h6692] and bud[^h6524], and fill[^h4390] the face[^h6440] of the world[^h8398] with fruit[^h8570].
###### 7
Hath he smitten[^h5221] him, as he smote[^h4347] those that smote[^h5221] him? or is he slain[^h2026] according to the slaughter[^h2027] of them that are slain[^h2026] by him? 
###### 8
In measure[^h5432], when it shooteth forth[^h7971], thou wilt debate[^h7378] with it: he stayeth[^h1898] his rough[^h7186] wind[^h7307] in the day[^h3117] of the east wind[^h6921].  
###### 9
By this[^h2063] therefore shall the iniquity[^h5771] of Jacob[^h3290] be purged[^h3722]; and this is all the fruit[^h6529] to take away[^h5493] his sin[^h2403]; when he maketh[^h7760] all the stones[^h68] of the altar[^h4196] as chalkstones[^h1615] that are beaten in sunder[^h5310], the groves[^h842] and images[^h2553] shall not stand up[^h6965]. 
###### 10
Yet the defenced[^h1219] city[^h5892] shall be desolate[^h910], and the habitation[^h5116] forsaken[^h7971], and left[^h5800] like a wilderness[^h4057]: there shall the calf[^h5695] feed[^h7462], and there shall he lie down[^h7257], and consume[^h3615] the branches[^h5585] thereof.
###### 11
When the boughs[^h7105] thereof are withered[^h3001], they shall be broken off[^h7665]: the women[^h802] come[^h935], and set them on fire[^h215]: for it is a people[^h5971] of no understanding[^h998]: therefore he that made[^h6213] them will not have mercy[^h7355] on them, and he that formed[^h3335] them will shew them no favour[^h2603].
###### 12
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that the LORD[^h3068] shall beat off[^h2251] from the channel[^h7641] of the river[^h5104] unto the stream[^h5158] of Egypt[^h4714], and ye shall be gathered[^h3950] one[^h259] by one[^h259], O ye children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 13
And it shall come to pass in that day[^h3117], that the great[^h1419] trumpet[^h7782] shall be blown[^h8628], and they shall come[^h935] which were ready to perish[^h6] in the land[^h776] of Assyria[^h804], and the outcasts[^h5080] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and shall worship[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068] in the holy[^h6944] mount[^h2022] at Jerusalem[^h3389].

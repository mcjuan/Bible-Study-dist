###### 1
Who hath believed[^h539] our report[^h8052]? and to whom is the arm[^h2220] of the LORD[^h3068] revealed[^h1540]? 
###### 2
For he shall grow up[^h5927] before[^h6440] him as a tender plant[^h3126], and as a root[^h8328] out of a dry[^h6723] ground[^h776]: he hath no form[^h8389] nor comeliness[^h1926]; and when we shall see[^h7200] him, there is no beauty[^h4758] that we should desire[^h2530] him.
###### 3
He is despised[^h959] and rejected[^h2310] of men[^h376]; a man[^h376] of sorrows[^h4341], and acquainted[^h3045] with grief[^h2483]: and we hid as it were[^h4564] our faces[^h6440] from him; he was despised[^h959], and we esteemed[^h2803] him not. 
###### 4
Surely[^h403] he hath borne[^h5375] our griefs[^h2483], and carried[^h5445] our sorrows[^h4341]: yet we did esteem[^h2803] him stricken[^h5060], smitten[^h5221] of God[^h430], and afflicted[^h6031].
###### 5
But he was wounded[^h2490] for our transgressions[^h6588], he was bruised[^h1792] for our iniquities[^h5771]: the chastisement[^h4148] of our peace[^h7965] was upon him; and with his stripes[^h2250] we are healed[^h7495].  
###### 6
All we like sheep[^h6629] have gone astray[^h8582]; we have turned[^h6437] every one[^h376] to his own way[^h1870]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath laid[^h6293] on him the iniquity[^h5771] of us all. 
###### 7
He was oppressed[^h5065], and he was afflicted[^h6031], yet he opened[^h6605] not his mouth[^h6310]: he is brought[^h2986] as a lamb[^h7716] to the slaughter[^h2874], and as a sheep[^h7353] before[^h6440] her shearers[^h1494] is dumb[^h481], so he openeth[^h6605] not his mouth[^h6310].
###### 8
He was taken[^h3947] from prison[^h6115] and from judgment[^h4941]: and who shall declare[^h7878] his generation[^h1755]? for he was cut off[^h1504] out of the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416]: for the transgression[^h6588] of my people[^h5971] was he stricken[^h5061].  
###### 9
And he made[^h5414] his grave[^h6913] with the wicked[^h7563], and with the rich[^h6223] in his death[^h4194]; because he had done[^h6213] no violence[^h2555], neither was any deceit[^h4820] in his mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 10
Yet it pleased[^h2654] the LORD[^h3068] to bruise[^h1792] him; he hath put him to grief[^h2470]: when thou shalt make[^h7760] his soul[^h5315] an offering for sin[^h817], he shall see[^h7200] his seed[^h2233], he shall prolong[^h748] his days[^h3117], and the pleasure[^h2656] of the LORD[^h3068] shall prosper[^h6743] in his hand[^h3027]. 
###### 11
He shall see[^h7200] of the travail[^h5999] of his soul[^h5315], and shall be satisfied[^h7646]: by his knowledge[^h1847] shall my righteous[^h6662] servant[^h5650] justify[^h6663] many[^h7227]; for he shall bear[^h5445] their iniquities[^h5771].
###### 12
Therefore will I divide[^h2505] him a portion with the great[^h7227], and he shall divide[^h2505] the spoil[^h7998] with the strong[^h6099]; because he hath poured out[^h6168] his soul[^h5315] unto death[^h4194]: and he was numbered[^h4487] with the transgressors[^h6586]; and he bare[^h5375] the sin[^h2399] of many[^h7227], and made intercession[^h6293] for the transgressors[^h6586].

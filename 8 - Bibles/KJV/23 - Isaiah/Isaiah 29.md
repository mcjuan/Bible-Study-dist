###### 1
Woe[^h1945] to Ariel[^h740], to Ariel[^h740], the city[^h7151] where David[^h1732] dwelt[^h2583]! add[^h5595] ye year[^h8141] to year[^h8141]; let them kill[^h5362] sacrifices[^h2282].   
###### 2
Yet I will distress[^h6693] Ariel[^h740], and there shall be heaviness[^h8386] and sorrow[^h592]: and it shall be unto me as Ariel[^h740].
###### 3
And I will camp[^h2583] against thee round about[^h1754], and will lay siege[^h6696] against thee with a mount[^h4674], and I will raise[^h6965] forts[^h4694] against thee.
###### 4
And thou shalt be brought down[^h8213], and shalt speak[^h1696] out of the ground[^h776], and thy speech[^h565] shall be low[^h7817] out of the dust[^h6083], and thy voice[^h6963] shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit[^h178], out of the ground[^h776], and thy speech[^h565] shall whisper[^h6850] out of the dust[^h6083]. 
###### 5
Moreover the multitude[^h1995] of thy strangers[^h2114] shall be like small[^h1851] dust[^h80], and the multitude[^h1995] of the terrible ones[^h6184] shall be as chaff[^h4671] that passeth away[^h5674]: yea, it shall be at an instant[^h6621] suddenly[^h6597].
###### 6
Thou shalt be visited[^h6485] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] with thunder[^h7482], and with earthquake[^h7494], and great[^h1419] noise[^h6963], with storm[^h5492] and tempest[^h5591], and the flame[^h3851] of devouring[^h398] fire[^h784].
###### 7
And the multitude[^h1995] of all the nations[^h1471] that fight[^h6633] against Ariel[^h740], even all that fight[^h6638] against her and her munition[^h4685], and that distress[^h6693] her, shall be as a dream[^h2472] of a night[^h3915] vision[^h2377].
###### 8
It shall even be as when an hungry[^h7457] man dreameth[^h2492], and, behold, he eateth[^h398]; but he awaketh[^h6974], and his soul[^h5315] is empty[^h7386]: or as when[^h834] a thirsty man[^h6771] dreameth[^h2492], and, behold, he drinketh[^h8354]; but he awaketh[^h6974], and, behold, he is faint[^h5889], and his soul[^h5315] hath appetite[^h8264]: so shall the multitude[^h1995] of all the nations[^h1471] be, that fight[^h6633] against mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726].
###### 9
Stay[^h4102] yourselves, and wonder[^h8539]; cry ye out[^h8173], and cry[^h8173]: they are drunken[^h7937], but not with wine[^h3196]; they stagger[^h5128], but not with strong drink[^h7941]. 
###### 10
For the LORD[^h3068] hath poured out[^h5258] upon you the spirit[^h7307] of deep sleep[^h8639], and hath closed[^h6105] your eyes[^h5869]: the prophets[^h5030] and your rulers[^h7218], the seers[^h2374] hath he covered[^h3680]. 
###### 11
And the vision[^h2380] of all is become unto you as the words[^h1697] of a book[^h5612] that is sealed[^h2856], which men deliver[^h5414] to one that is learned[^h3045], saying[^h559], Read[^h7121] this, I pray thee: and he saith[^h559], I cannot[^h3201]; for it is sealed[^h2856]: 
###### 12
And the book[^h5612] is delivered[^h5414] to him that is not learned[^h3045] [^h5612], saying[^h559], Read[^h7121] this, I pray thee: and he saith[^h559], I am not learned[^h3045].
###### 13
Wherefore the Lord[^h136] said[^h559], Forasmuch[^h3282] as this people[^h5971] draw near[^h5066] me with their mouth[^h6310], and with their lips[^h8193] do honour[^h3513] me, but have removed[^h7368] their heart[^h3820] far[^h7368] from me, and their fear[^h3374] toward me is taught[^h3925] by the precept[^h4687] of men[^h582]:
###### 14
Therefore, behold, I will proceed[^h3254] to do a marvellous work[^h6381] among this people[^h5971], even a marvellous work[^h6381] and a wonder[^h6382]: for the wisdom[^h2451] of their wise[^h2450] men shall perish[^h6], and the understanding[^h998] of their prudent[^h995] men shall be hid[^h5641]. 
###### 15
Woe[^h1945] unto them that seek deep[^h6009] to hide[^h5641] their counsel[^h6098] from the LORD[^h3068], and their works[^h4639] are in the dark[^h4285], and they say[^h559], Who seeth[^h7200] us? and who knoweth[^h3045] us?
###### 16
Surely your turning of things upside down[^h2017] shall be esteemed[^h2803] as the potter's[^h3335] clay[^h2563]: for shall the work[^h4639] say[^h559] of him that made[^h6213] it, He made[^h6213] me not? or shall the thing framed[^h3336] say[^h559] of him that framed[^h3335] it, He had no understanding[^h995]?
###### 17
Is it not yet a very[^h4213] little while[^h4592], and Lebanon[^h3844] shall be turned[^h7725] into a fruitful field[^h3759], and the fruitful field[^h3759] shall be esteemed[^h2803] as a forest[^h3293]?
###### 18
And in that day[^h3117] shall the deaf[^h2795] hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612], and the eyes[^h5869] of the blind[^h5787] shall see[^h7200] out of obscurity[^h652], and out of darkness[^h2822].
###### 19
The meek[^h6035] also shall increase[^h3254] their joy[^h8057] in the LORD[^h3068], and the poor[^h34] among men[^h120] shall rejoice[^h1523] in the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 20
For the terrible one[^h6184] is brought to nought[^h656], and the scorner[^h3887] is consumed[^h3615], and all that watch[^h8245] for iniquity[^h205] are cut off[^h3772]:
###### 21
That make a man[^h120] an offender[^h2398] for a word[^h1697], and lay a snare[^h6983] for him that reproveth[^h3198] in the gate[^h8179], and turn aside[^h5186] the just[^h6662] for a thing of nought[^h8414].
###### 22
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], who redeemed[^h6299] Abraham[^h85], concerning the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], Jacob[^h3290] shall not now be ashamed[^h954], neither shall his face[^h6440] now wax pale[^h2357].
###### 23
But when he seeth[^h7200] his children[^h3206], the work[^h4639] of mine hands[^h3027], in the midst[^h7130] of him, they shall sanctify[^h6942] my name[^h8034], and sanctify[^h6942] the Holy One[^h6918] of Jacob[^h3290], and shall fear[^h6206] the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
They also that erred[^h8582] in spirit[^h7307] shall come[^h3045] to understanding[^h998], and they that murmured[^h7279] shall learn[^h3925] doctrine[^h3948].

###### 1
And when the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320] was come[^h5060], and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were in the cities[^h5892], the people[^h5971] gathered themselves together[^h622] as one[^h259] man[^h376] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
Then stood up[^h6965] Jeshua[^h3442] the son[^h1121] of Jozadak[^h3136], and his brethren[^h251] the priests[^h3548], and Zerubbabel[^h2216] the son[^h1121] of Shealtiel[^h7597], and his brethren[^h251], and builded[^h1129] the altar[^h4196] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], to offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] thereon, as it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872] the man[^h376] of God[^h430].   
###### 3
And they set[^h3559] the altar[^h4196] upon his bases[^h4350]; for fear[^h367] was upon them because of the people[^h5971] of those countries[^h776]: and they offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] thereon unto the LORD[^h3068], even burnt offerings[^h5930] morning[^h1242] and evening[^h6153].
###### 4
They kept[^h6213] also the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521], as it is written[^h3789], and offered the daily[^h3117] [^h3117] burnt offerings[^h5930] by number[^h4557], according to the custom[^h4941], as the duty[^h1697] of every day[^h3117] required[^h3117]; 
###### 5
And afterward[^h310] offered the continual[^h8548] burnt offering[^h5930], both of the new moons[^h2320], and of all the set feasts[^h4150] of the LORD[^h3068] that were consecrated[^h6942], and of every one that willingly offered[^h5068] a freewill offering[^h5071] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
From the first[^h259] day[^h3117] of the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320] began[^h2490] they to offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068]. But the foundation[^h3245] of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068] was not yet laid[^h3245]. 
###### 7
They gave[^h5414] money[^h3701] also unto the masons[^h2672], and to the carpenters[^h2796]; and meat[^h3978], and drink[^h4960], and oil[^h8081], unto them of Zidon[^h6722], and to them of Tyre[^h6876], to bring[^h935] cedar[^h730] trees[^h6086] from Lebanon[^h3844] to the sea[^h3220] of Joppa[^h3305], according to the grant[^h7558] that they had of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539]. 
###### 8
Now in the second[^h8145] year[^h8141] of their coming[^h935] unto the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] at Jerusalem[^h3389], in the second[^h8145] month[^h2320], began[^h2490] Zerubbabel[^h2216] the son[^h1121] of Shealtiel[^h7597], and Jeshua[^h3442] the son[^h1121] of Jozadak[^h3136], and the remnant[^h7605] of their brethren[^h251] the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and all they that were come out[^h935] of the captivity[^h7628] unto Jerusalem[^h3389]; and appointed[^h5975] the Levites[^h3881], from twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and upward[^h4605], to set forward[^h5329] the work[^h4399] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
Then stood[^h5975] Jeshua[^h3442] with his sons[^h1121] and his brethren[^h251], Kadmiel[^h6934] and his sons[^h1121], the sons[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063], together[^h259], to set forward[^h5329] the workmen[^h6213] [^h4399] in the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]: the sons[^h1121] of Henadad[^h2582], with their sons[^h1121] and their brethren[^h251] the Levites[^h3881].  
###### 10
And when the builders[^h1129] laid the foundation[^h3245] of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], they set[^h5975] the priests[^h3548] in their apparel[^h3847] with trumpets[^h2689], and the Levites[^h3881] the sons[^h1121] of Asaph[^h623] with cymbals[^h4700], to praise[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068], after the ordinance[^h3027] of David[^h1732] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And they sang together by course[^h6030] in praising[^h1984] and giving thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068]; because he is good[^h2896], for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769] toward Israel[^h3478]. And all the people[^h5971] shouted[^h7321] with a great[^h1419] shout[^h8643], when they praised[^h1984] the LORD[^h3068], because the foundation[^h3245] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] was laid[^h3245].
###### 12
But many[^h7227] of the priests[^h3548] and Levites[^h3881] and chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1], who were ancient men[^h2205], that had seen[^h7200] the first[^h7223] house[^h1004], when the foundation[^h3245] of this house[^h1004] was laid[^h3245] before their eyes[^h5869], wept[^h1058] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963]; and many[^h7227] shouted[^h8643] aloud[^h7311] for joy[^h8057]:
###### 13
So that the people[^h5971] could not discern[^h5234] the noise[^h6963] of the shout[^h8643] of joy[^h8057] from the noise[^h6963] of the weeping[^h1065] of the people[^h5971]: for the people[^h5971] shouted[^h7321] with a loud[^h1419] shout[^h8643], and the noise[^h6963] was heard[^h8085] afar off[^h7350].

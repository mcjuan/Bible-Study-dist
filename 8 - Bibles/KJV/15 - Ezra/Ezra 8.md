###### 15
And I gathered them together[^h6908] to the river[^h5104] that runneth[^h935] to Ahava[^h163]; and there abode we in tents[^h2583] three[^h7969] days[^h3117]: and I viewed[^h995] the people[^h5971], and the priests[^h3548], and found[^h4672] there none of the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878]. 
###### 16
Then sent[^h7971] I for Eliezer[^h461], for Ariel[^h740], for Shemaiah[^h8098], and for Elnathan[^h494], and for Jarib[^h3402], and for Elnathan[^h494], and for Nathan[^h5416], and for Zechariah[^h2148], and for Meshullam[^h4918], chief men[^h7218]; also for Joiarib[^h3114], and for Elnathan[^h494], men of understanding[^h995].
###### 17
And I sent[^h6680] them with commandment[^h3318] unto Iddo[^h112] the chief[^h7218] at the place[^h4725] Casiphia[^h3703], and I told[^h7760] [^h6310] them what[^h1697] they should say[^h1696] unto Iddo[^h112], and to his brethren[^h251] the Nethinims[^h5411] [^h5411], at the place[^h4725] Casiphia[^h3703], that they should bring[^h935] unto us ministers[^h8334] for the house[^h1004] of our God[^h430]. 
###### 18
And by the good[^h2896] hand[^h3027] of our God[^h430] upon us they brought[^h935] us a man[^h376] of understanding[^h7922], of the sons[^h1121] of Mahli[^h4249], the son[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], the son[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; and Sherebiah[^h8274], with his sons[^h1121] and his brethren[^h251], eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240];
###### 19
And Hashabiah[^h2811], and with him Jeshaiah[^h3470] of the sons[^h1121] of Merari[^h4847], his brethren[^h251] and their sons[^h1121], twenty[^h6242];
###### 20
Also of the Nethinims[^h5411], whom David[^h1732] and the princes[^h8269] had appointed[^h5414] for the service[^h5656] of the Levites[^h3881], two hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] Nethinims[^h5411]: all of them were expressed[^h5344] by name[^h8034].
###### 21
Then I proclaimed[^h7121] a fast[^h6685] there, at the river[^h5104] of Ahava[^h163], that we might afflict[^h6031] ourselves before[^h6440] our God[^h430], to seek[^h1245] of him a right[^h3477] way[^h1870] for us, and for our little ones[^h2945], and for all our substance[^h7399].
###### 22
For I was ashamed[^h954] to require[^h7592] of the king[^h4428] a band of soldiers[^h2428] and horsemen[^h6571] to help[^h5826] us against the enemy[^h341] in the way[^h1870]: because we had spoken[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], The hand[^h3027] of our God[^h430] is upon all them for good[^h2896] that seek[^h1245] him; but his power[^h5797] and his wrath[^h639] is against all them that forsake[^h5800] him.
###### 23
So we fasted[^h6684] and besought[^h1245] our God[^h430] for this: and he was intreated[^h6279] of us.
###### 24
Then I separated[^h914] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] of the chief[^h8269] of the priests[^h3548], Sherebiah[^h8274], Hashabiah[^h2811], and ten[^h6235] of their brethren[^h251] with them,
###### 25
And weighed[^h8254] unto them the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the vessels[^h3627], even the offering[^h8641] of the house[^h1004] of our God[^h430], which the king[^h4428], and his counsellors[^h3289], and his lords[^h8269], and all Israel[^h3478] there present[^h4672], had offered[^h7311]:
###### 26
I even weighed[^h8254] unto their hand[^h3027] six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and silver[^h3701] vessels[^h3627] an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603], and of gold[^h2091] an hundred[^h3967] talents[^h3603];
###### 27
Also twenty[^h6242] basons[^h3713] of gold[^h2091], of a thousand[^h505] drams[^h150]; and two[^h8147] vessels[^h3627] of fine[^h2896] [^h6668] copper[^h5178], precious[^h2532] as gold[^h2091].  
###### 28
And I said[^h559] unto them, Ye are holy[^h6944] unto the LORD[^h3068]; the vessels[^h3627] are holy[^h6944] also; and the silver[^h3701] and the gold[^h2091] are a freewill offering[^h5071] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1].
###### 29
Watch[^h8245] ye, and keep[^h8104] them, until ye weigh[^h8254] them before[^h6440] the chief[^h8269] of the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881], and chief[^h8269] of the fathers[^h1] of Israel[^h3478], at Jerusalem[^h3389], in the chambers[^h3957] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 30
So took[^h6901] the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] the weight[^h4948] of the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the vessels[^h3627], to bring[^h935] them to Jerusalem[^h3389] unto the house[^h1004] of our God[^h430].
###### 31
Then we departed[^h5265] from the river[^h5104] of Ahava[^h163] on the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] day of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], to go[^h3212] unto Jerusalem[^h3389]: and the hand[^h3027] of our God[^h430] was upon us, and he delivered[^h5337] us from the hand[^h3709] of the enemy[^h341], and of such as lay in wait[^h693] by the way[^h1870].
###### 32
And we came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and abode[^h3427] there three[^h7969] days[^h3117].
###### 33
Now on the fourth[^h7243] day[^h3117] was the silver[^h3701] and the gold[^h2091] and the vessels[^h3627] weighed[^h8254] in the house[^h1004] of our God[^h430] by the hand[^h3027] of Meremoth[^h4822] the son[^h1121] of Uriah[^h223] the priest[^h3548]; and with him was Eleazar[^h499] the son[^h1121] of Phinehas[^h6372]; and with them was Jozabad[^h3107] the son[^h1121] of Jeshua[^h3442], and Noadiah[^h5129] the son[^h1121] of Binnui[^h1131], Levites[^h3881];
###### 34
By number[^h4557] and by weight[^h4948] of every one: and all the weight[^h4948] was written[^h3789] at that time[^h6256].
###### 35
Also the children[^h1121] of those that had been carried away[^h1473], which were come out[^h935] of the captivity[^h7628], offered[^h7126] burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] bullocks[^h6499] for all Israel[^h3478], ninety[^h8673] and six[^h8337] rams[^h352], seventy[^h7657] and seven[^h7651] lambs[^h3532], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] he goats[^h6842] for a sin offering[^h2403]: all this was a burnt offering[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 36
And they delivered[^h5414] the king's[^h4428] commissions[^h1881] unto the king's[^h4428] lieutenants[^h323], and to the governors[^h6346] on this side[^h5676] the river[^h5104]: and they furthered[^h5375] the people[^h5971], and the house[^h1004] of God[^h430].

###### 1
Now in the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] by the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414] might be fulfilled[^h3615], the LORD[^h3068] stirred up[^h5782] the spirit[^h7307] of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], that he made a proclamation[^h5674] [^h6963] throughout all his kingdom[^h4438], and put it also in writing[^h4385], saying[^h559], 
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539], The LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064] hath given[^h5414] me all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776]; and he hath charged[^h6485] me to build[^h1129] him an house[^h1004] at Jerusalem[^h3389], which is in Judah[^h3063].
###### 3
Who is there among you of all his people[^h5971]? his God[^h430] be with him, and let him go up[^h5927] to Jerusalem[^h3389], which is in Judah[^h3063], and build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], (he is the God[^h430],) which is in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 4
And whosoever remaineth[^h7604] in any place[^h4725] where he sojourneth[^h1481], let the men[^h582] of his place[^h4725] help[^h5375] him with silver[^h3701], and with gold[^h2091], and with goods[^h7399], and with beasts[^h929], beside the freewill offering[^h5071] for the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] that is in Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 5
Then rose up[^h6965] the chief[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], and the priests[^h3548], and the Levites[^h3881], with all them whose spirit[^h7307] God[^h430] had raised[^h5782], to go up[^h5927] to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] which is in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 6
And all they that were about[^h5439] them strengthened[^h2388] their hands[^h3027] with vessels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], with gold[^h2091], with goods[^h7399], and with beasts[^h929], and with precious things[^h4030], beside all that was willingly offered[^h5068]. 
###### 7
Also Cyrus[^h3566] the king[^h4428] brought forth[^h3318] the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], which Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] had brought forth[^h3318] out of Jerusalem[^h3389], and had put[^h5414] them in the house[^h1004] of his gods[^h430];
###### 8
Even those did Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539] bring forth[^h3318] by the hand[^h3027] of Mithredath[^h4990] the treasurer[^h1489], and numbered[^h5608] them unto Sheshbazzar[^h8339], the prince[^h5387] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 9
And this is the number[^h4557] of them: thirty[^h7970] chargers[^h105] of gold[^h2091], a thousand[^h505] chargers[^h105] of silver[^h3701], nine[^h8672] and twenty[^h6242] knives[^h4252],
###### 10
Thirty[^h7970] basons[^h3713] of gold[^h2091], silver[^h3701] basons[^h3713] of a second[^h4932] sort four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] and ten[^h6235], and other[^h312] vessels[^h3627] a thousand[^h505].
###### 11
All the vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091] and of silver[^h3701] were five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] and four[^h702] hundred[^h3967]. All these did Sheshbazzar[^h8339] bring up[^h5927] with them of the captivity[^h1473] that were brought up[^h5927] from Babylon[^h894] unto Jerusalem[^h3389].

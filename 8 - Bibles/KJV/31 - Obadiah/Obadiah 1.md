###### 1
The vision[^h2377] of Obadiah[^h5662]. Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] concerning Edom[^h123]; We have heard[^h8085] a rumour[^h8052] from the LORD[^h3068], and an ambassador[^h6735] is sent[^h7971] among the heathen[^h1471], Arise[^h6965] ye, and let us rise up[^h6965] against her in battle[^h4421].
###### 2
Behold, I have made[^h5414] thee small[^h6996] among the heathen[^h1471]: thou art greatly[^h3966] despised[^h959].
###### 3
The pride[^h2087] of thine heart[^h3820] hath deceived[^h5377] thee, thou that dwellest[^h7931] in the clefts[^h2288] of the rock[^h5553], whose habitation[^h3427] is high[^h4791]; that saith[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], Who shall bring me down[^h3381] to the ground[^h776]?
###### 4
Though thou exalt[^h1361] thyself as the eagle[^h5404], and though thou set[^h7760] thy nest[^h7064] among the stars[^h3556], thence will I bring thee down[^h3381], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
If thieves[^h1590] came[^h935] to thee, if robbers[^h7703] by night[^h3915], (how art thou cut off[^h1820]!) would they not have stolen[^h1589] till they had enough[^h1767]? if the grapegatherers[^h1219] came[^h935] to thee, would they not leave[^h7604] some grapes[^h5955]? 
###### 6
How are the things of Esau[^h6215] searched out[^h2664]! how are his hidden[^h4710] things sought up[^h1158]!
###### 7
All the men[^h582] of thy confederacy[^h1285] have brought[^h7971] thee even to the border[^h1366]: the men[^h582] that were at peace[^h7965] with thee have deceived[^h5377] thee, and prevailed[^h3201] against thee; they that eat thy bread[^h3899] have laid[^h7760] a wound[^h4204] under thee: there is none understanding[^h8394] in him.   
###### 8
Shall I not in that day[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], even destroy[^h6] the wise[^h2450] men out of Edom[^h123], and understanding[^h8394] out of the mount[^h2022] of Esau[^h6215]?
###### 9
And thy mighty[^h1368] men, O Teman[^h8487], shall be dismayed[^h2865], to the end that every one[^h376] of the mount[^h2022] of Esau[^h6215] may be cut off[^h3772] by slaughter[^h6993].
###### 10
For thy violence[^h2555] against thy brother[^h251] Jacob[^h3290] shame[^h955] shall cover[^h3680] thee, and thou shalt be cut off[^h3772] for ever[^h5769].
###### 11
In the day[^h3117] that thou stoodest[^h5975] on the other side, in the day[^h3117] that the strangers[^h2114] carried away captive[^h7617] his forces[^h2428], and foreigners[^h5237] entered[^h935] into his gates[^h8179], and cast[^h3032] lots[^h1486] upon Jerusalem[^h3389], even thou wast as one[^h259] of them. 
###### 12
But thou shouldest not have looked[^h7200] on the day[^h3117] of thy brother[^h251] in the day[^h3117] that he became a stranger[^h5235]; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced[^h8055] over the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] in the day[^h3117] of their destruction[^h6]; neither shouldest thou have spoken[^h6310] proudly[^h1431] in the day[^h3117] of distress[^h6869]. 
###### 13
Thou shouldest not have entered[^h935] into the gate[^h8179] of my people[^h5971] in the day[^h3117] of their calamity[^h343]; yea, thou shouldest not have looked[^h7200] on their affliction[^h7451] in the day[^h3117] of their calamity[^h343], nor have laid[^h7971] hands on their substance[^h2428] in the day[^h3117] of their calamity[^h343]; 
###### 14
Neither shouldest thou have stood[^h5975] in the crossway[^h6563], to cut off[^h3772] those of his that did escape[^h6412]; neither shouldest thou have delivered up[^h5462] those of his that did remain[^h8300] in the day[^h3117] of distress[^h6869]. 
###### 15
For the day[^h3117] of the LORD[^h3068] is near[^h7138] upon all the heathen[^h1471]: as thou hast done[^h6213], it shall be done[^h6213] unto thee: thy reward[^h1576] shall return[^h7725] upon thine own head[^h7218].
###### 16
For as ye have drunk[^h8354] upon my holy[^h6944] mountain[^h2022], so shall all the heathen[^h1471] drink[^h8354] continually[^h8548], yea, they shall drink[^h8354], and they shall swallow down[^h3886], and they shall be as though they had not[^h3808] been. 
###### 17
But upon mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726] shall be deliverance[^h6413], and there shall be holiness[^h6944]; and the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290] shall possess[^h3423] their possessions[^h4180].  
###### 18
And the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290] shall be a fire[^h784], and the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130] a flame[^h3852], and the house[^h1004] of Esau[^h6215] for stubble[^h7179], and they shall kindle[^h1814] in them, and devour[^h398] them; and there shall not be any remaining[^h8300] of the house[^h1004] of Esau[^h6215]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 19
And they of the south[^h5045] shall possess[^h3423] the mount[^h2022] of Esau[^h6215]; and they of the plain[^h8219] the Philistines[^h6430]: and they shall possess[^h3423] the fields[^h7704] of Ephraim[^h669], and the fields[^h7704] of Samaria[^h8111]: and Benjamin[^h1144] shall possess Gilead[^h1568].
###### 20
And the captivity[^h1546] of this host[^h2426] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall possess that of the Canaanites[^h3669], even unto Zarephath[^h6886]; and the captivity[^h1546] of Jerusalem[^h3389], which is in Sepharad[^h5614], shall possess[^h3423] the cities[^h5892] of the south[^h5045]. 
###### 21
And saviours[^h3467] shall come up[^h5927] on mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726] to judge[^h8199] the mount[^h2022] of Esau[^h6215]; and the kingdom[^h4410] shall be the LORD'S[^h3068].

###### 1
And it was told[^h5046] Joab[^h3097], Behold, the king[^h4428] weepeth[^h1058] and mourneth[^h56] for Absalom[^h53].
###### 2
And the victory[^h8668] that day[^h3117] was turned into mourning[^h60] unto all the people[^h5971]: for the people[^h5971] heard[^h8085] say[^h559] that day[^h3117] how the king[^h4428] was grieved[^h6087] for his son[^h1121]. 
###### 3
And the people[^h5971] gat[^h935] them by stealth[^h1589] that day[^h3117] into the city[^h5892], as people[^h5971] being ashamed[^h3637] steal away[^h1589] when they flee[^h5127] in battle[^h4421].
###### 4
But the king[^h4428] covered[^h3813] his face[^h6440], and the king[^h4428] cried[^h2199] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], O my son[^h1121] Absalom[^h53], O Absalom[^h53], my son[^h1121], my son[^h1121]!
###### 5
And Joab[^h3097] came[^h935] into the house[^h1004] to the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], Thou hast shamed[^h3001] this day[^h3117] the faces[^h6440] of all thy servants[^h5650], which this day[^h3117] have saved[^h4422] thy life[^h5315], and the lives[^h5315] of thy sons[^h1121] and of thy daughters[^h1323], and the lives[^h5315] of thy wives[^h802], and the lives[^h5315] of thy concubines[^h6370];
###### 6
In that thou lovest[^h157] thine enemies[^h8130], and hatest[^h8130] thy friends[^h157]. For thou hast declared[^h5046] this day[^h3117], that thou regardest neither princes[^h8269] nor servants[^h5650]: for this day[^h3117] I perceive[^h3045], that if[^h3863] Absalom[^h53] had lived[^h2416], and all we had died[^h4191] this day[^h3117], then it had pleased thee well[^h3477] [^h5869].  
###### 7
Now therefore arise[^h6965], go forth[^h3318], and speak[^h1696] comfortably[^h3820] unto thy servants[^h5650]: for I swear[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068], if thou go not forth[^h3318], there will not tarry[^h3885] one[^h376] with thee this night[^h3915]: and that will be worse[^h7489] unto thee than all the evil[^h7451] that befell[^h935] thee from thy youth[^h5271] until now. 
###### 8
Then the king[^h4428] arose[^h6965], and sat[^h3427] in the gate[^h8179]. And they told[^h5046] unto all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Behold, the king[^h4428] doth sit[^h3427] in the gate[^h8179]. And all the people[^h5971] came[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]: for Israel[^h3478] had fled[^h5127] every man[^h376] to his tent[^h168].
###### 9
And all the people[^h5971] were at strife[^h1777] throughout all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], The king[^h4428] saved[^h5337] us out of the hand[^h3709] of our enemies[^h341], and he delivered[^h4422] us out of the hand[^h3709] of the Philistines[^h6430]; and now he is fled[^h1272] out of the land[^h776] for Absalom[^h53].
###### 10
And Absalom[^h53], whom we anointed[^h4886] over us, is dead[^h4191] in battle[^h4421]. Now therefore why speak[^h2790] ye not a word of bringing[^h7725] the king[^h4428] back[^h7725]? 
###### 11
And king[^h4428] David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] to Zadok[^h6659] and to Abiathar[^h54] the priests[^h3548], saying[^h559], Speak[^h1696] unto the elders[^h2205] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], Why are ye the last[^h314] to bring[^h7725] the king[^h4428] back[^h7725] to his house[^h1004]? seeing the speech[^h1697] of all Israel[^h3478] is come[^h935] to the king[^h4428], even to his house[^h1004].
###### 12
Ye are my brethren[^h251], ye are my bones[^h6106] and my flesh[^h1320]: wherefore then are ye the last[^h314] to bring back[^h7725] the king[^h4428]?
###### 13
And say[^h559] ye to Amasa[^h6021], Art thou not of my bone[^h6106], and of my flesh[^h1320]? God[^h430] do[^h6213] so to me, and more[^h3254] also, if thou be not captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] before[^h6440] me continually[^h3117] in the room[^h8478] of Joab[^h3097].
###### 14
And he bowed[^h5186] the heart[^h3824] of all the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], even as the heart of one[^h259] man[^h376]; so that they sent[^h7971] this word unto the king[^h4428], Return[^h7725] thou, and all thy servants[^h5650].
###### 15
So the king[^h4428] returned[^h7725], and came[^h935] to Jordan[^h3383]. And Judah[^h3063] came[^h935] to Gilgal[^h1537], to go[^h3212] to meet[^h7125] the king[^h4428], to conduct[^h5674] the king[^h4428] over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383].
###### 16
And Shimei[^h8096] the son[^h1121] of Gera[^h1617], a Benjamite[^h1145], which was of Bahurim[^h980], hasted[^h4116] and came down[^h3381] with the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] to meet[^h7125] king[^h4428] David[^h1732].
###### 17
And there were a thousand[^h505] men[^h376] of Benjamin[^h1145] with him, and Ziba[^h6717] the servant[^h5288] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], and his fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] sons[^h1121] and his twenty[^h6242] servants[^h5650] with him; and they went over[^h6743] Jordan[^h3383] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 18
And there went over[^h5674] a ferry boat[^h5679] to carry over[^h5674] the king's[^h4428] household[^h1004], and to do[^h6213] what he thought[^h5869] good[^h2896]. And Shimei[^h8096] the son[^h1121] of Gera[^h1617] fell down[^h5307] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], as he was come over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383]; 
###### 19
And said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Let not my lord[^h113] impute[^h2803] iniquity[^h5771] unto me, neither do thou remember[^h2142] that which thy servant[^h5650] did perversely[^h5753] the day[^h3117] that my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] went out[^h3318] of Jerusalem[^h3389], that the king[^h4428] should take[^h7760] it to his heart[^h3820].
###### 20
For thy servant[^h5650] doth know[^h3045] that I have sinned[^h2398]: therefore, behold, I am come[^h935] the first[^h7223] this day[^h3117] of all the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130] to go down[^h3381] to meet[^h7125] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428].
###### 21
But Abishai[^h52] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Shall not Shimei[^h8096] be put to death[^h4191] for this, because he cursed[^h7043] the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899]?
###### 22
And David[^h1732] said[^h559], What have I to do with you, ye sons[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], that ye should this day[^h3117] be adversaries[^h7854] unto me? shall there any man[^h376] be put to death[^h4191] this day[^h3117] in Israel[^h3478]? for do not I know[^h3045] that I am this day[^h3117] king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478]?
###### 23
Therefore the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Shimei[^h8096], Thou shalt not die[^h4191]. And the king[^h4428] sware[^h7650] unto him.
###### 24
And Mephibosheth[^h4648] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586] came down[^h3381] to meet[^h7125] the king[^h4428], and had neither[^h3808] dressed[^h6213] his feet[^h7272], nor trimmed[^h6213] his beard[^h8222], nor washed[^h3526] his clothes[^h899], from the day[^h3117] the king[^h4428] departed[^h3212] until the day[^h3117] he came[^h935] again in peace[^h7965].
###### 25
And it came to pass, when he was come[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389] to meet[^h7125] the king[^h4428], that the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Wherefore wentest[^h1980] not thou with me, Mephibosheth[^h4648]?
###### 26
And he answered[^h559], My lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], my servant[^h5650] deceived[^h7411] me: for thy servant[^h5650] said[^h559], I will saddle[^h2280] me an ass[^h2543], that I may ride[^h7392] thereon, and go[^h3212] to the king[^h4428]; because thy servant[^h5650] is lame[^h6455].
###### 27
And he hath slandered[^h7270] thy servant[^h5650] unto my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]; but my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] is as an angel[^h4397] of God[^h430]: do[^h6213] therefore what is good[^h2896] in thine eyes[^h5869].
###### 28
For all of my father's[^h1] house[^h1004] were but[^h3808] dead[^h4194] men[^h582] before my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]: yet didst thou set[^h7896] thy servant[^h5650] among them that did eat[^h398] at thine own table[^h7979]. What right[^h6666] therefore have[^h3426] I yet to cry[^h2199] any more unto the king[^h4428]? 
###### 29
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Why speakest[^h1696] thou any more of thy matters[^h1697]? I have said[^h559], Thou and Ziba[^h6717] divide[^h2505] the land[^h7704].
###### 30
And Mephibosheth[^h4648] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Yea, let him take[^h3947] all, forasmuch[^h310] as[^h834] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] is come again[^h935] in peace[^h7965] unto his own house[^h1004].
###### 31
And Barzillai[^h1271] the Gileadite[^h1569] came down[^h3381] from Rogelim[^h7274], and went over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] with the king[^h4428], to conduct[^h7971] him over Jordan[^h3383].
###### 32
Now Barzillai[^h1271] was a very[^h3966] aged[^h2204] man, even fourscore[^h8084] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]: and he had provided the king[^h4428] of sustenance[^h3557] while he lay[^h7871] at Mahanaim[^h4266]; for he was a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] man[^h376].
###### 33
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Barzillai[^h1271], Come thou over[^h5674] with me, and I will feed[^h3557] thee with me in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 34
And Barzillai[^h1271] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], How long[^h3117] have I to live[^h8141] [^h2416], that I should go up[^h5927] with the king[^h4428] unto Jerusalem[^h3389]? 
###### 35
I am this day[^h3117] fourscore[^h8084] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]: and can I discern[^h3045] between good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451]? can thy servant[^h5650] taste[^h2938] what[^h834] I eat[^h398] or what[^h834] I drink[^h8354]? can I hear[^h8085] any more the voice[^h6963] of singing men[^h7891] and singing women[^h7891]? wherefore then should thy servant[^h5650] be yet a burden[^h4853] unto my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]?
###### 36
Thy servant[^h5650] will go[^h5674] a little way[^h4592] over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] with the king[^h4428]: and why should the king[^h4428] recompense[^h1580] it me with such a reward[^h1578]?
###### 37
Let thy servant[^h5650], I pray thee, turn back again[^h7725], that I may die[^h4191] in mine own city[^h5892], and be buried by the grave[^h6913] of my father[^h1] and of my mother[^h517]. But behold thy servant[^h5650] Chimham[^h3643]; let him go over[^h5674] with my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]; and do[^h6213] to him what shall seem good[^h2896] [^h5869] unto thee.
###### 38
And the king[^h4428] answered[^h559], Chimham[^h3643] shall go[^h5674] over with me, and I will do[^h6213] to him that which shall seem good[^h2896] [^h5869] unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require[^h977] of me, that will I do[^h6213] for thee. 
###### 39
And all the people[^h5971] went over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383]. And when the king[^h4428] was come over[^h5674], the king[^h4428] kissed[^h5401] Barzillai[^h1271], and blessed[^h1288] him; and he returned[^h7725] unto his own place[^h4725].
###### 40
Then the king[^h4428] went on[^h5674] to Gilgal[^h1537], and Chimham[^h3643] went on[^h5674] with him: and all the people[^h5971] of Judah[^h3063] conducted[^h5674] [^h5674] the king[^h4428], and also half[^h2677] the people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 41
And, behold, all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Why have our brethren[^h251] the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] stolen thee away[^h1589], and have brought[^h5674] the king[^h4428], and his household[^h1004], and all David's[^h1732] men[^h582] with him, over Jordan[^h3383]?
###### 42
And all the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] answered[^h6030] the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], Because the king[^h4428] is near of kin[^h7138] to us: wherefore then be ye angry[^h2734] for this matter[^h1697]? have we eaten[^h398] at all[^h398] of the king's[^h4428] cost? or hath he given[^h5375] us any gift[^h5379]?
###### 43
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] answered[^h6030] the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and said[^h559], We have ten[^h6235] parts[^h3027] in the king[^h4428], and we[^h589] have also more right in David[^h1732] than ye: why then did ye despise[^h7043] us, that our advice[^h1697] should not be first[^h7223] had in bringing back[^h7725] our king[^h4428]? And the words[^h1697] of the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] were fiercer[^h7185] than the words[^h1697] of the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478].

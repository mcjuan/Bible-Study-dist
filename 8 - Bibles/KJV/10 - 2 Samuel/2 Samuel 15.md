###### 1
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that Absalom[^h53] prepared[^h6213] him chariots[^h4818] and horses[^h5483], and fifty[^h2572] men[^h376] to run[^h7323] before[^h6440] him.
###### 2
And Absalom[^h53] rose up early[^h7925], and stood[^h5975] beside[^h3027] the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179]: and it was so, that when any man[^h376] that had a controversy[^h7379] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428] for judgment[^h4941], then Absalom[^h53] called[^h7121] unto him, and said[^h559], Of what[^h335] city[^h5892] art thou? And he said[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] is of one[^h259] of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 3
And Absalom[^h53] said[^h559] unto him, See[^h7200], thy matters[^h1697] are good[^h2896] and right[^h5228]; but there is no man deputed of the king[^h4428] to hear[^h8085] thee. 
###### 4
Absalom[^h53] said[^h559] moreover, Oh that I were made[^h7760] judge[^h8199] in the land[^h776], that every man[^h376] which hath any suit[^h7379] or cause[^h4941] might come[^h935] unto me, and I would do him justice[^h6663]!
###### 5
And it was so, that when any man[^h376] came nigh[^h7126] to him to do him obeisance[^h7812], he put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and took[^h2388] him, and kissed[^h5401] him.
###### 6
And on this manner[^h1697] did[^h6213] Absalom[^h53] to all Israel[^h3478] that came[^h935] to the king[^h4428] for judgment[^h4941]: so Absalom[^h53] stole[^h1589] the hearts[^h3820] of the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And it came to pass after[^h7093] forty[^h705] years[^h8141], that Absalom[^h53] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], I pray thee, let me go[^h3212] and pay[^h7999] my vow[^h5088], which I have vowed[^h5087] unto the LORD[^h3068], in Hebron[^h2275].
###### 8
For thy servant[^h5650] vowed[^h5087] a vow[^h5088] while I abode[^h3427] at Geshur[^h1650] in Syria[^h758], saying[^h559], If the LORD[^h3068] shall bring me again[^h7725] [^h7725] indeed to Jerusalem[^h3389], then I will serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965]. So he arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to Hebron[^h2275].
###### 10
But Absalom[^h53] sent[^h7971] spies[^h7270] throughout all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], As soon as ye hear[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], then ye shall say[^h559], Absalom[^h53] reigneth[^h4427] in Hebron[^h2275].
###### 11
And with Absalom[^h53] went[^h1980] two hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] out of Jerusalem[^h3389], that were called[^h7121]; and they went[^h1980] in their simplicity[^h8537], and they knew[^h3045] not any thing[^h1697].
###### 12
And Absalom[^h53] sent[^h7971] for Ahithophel[^h302] the Gilonite[^h1526], David's[^h1732] counsellor[^h3289], from his city[^h5892], even from Giloh[^h1542], while he offered[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077]. And the conspiracy[^h7195] was strong[^h533]; for the people[^h5971] increased[^h7227] continually[^h1980] with Absalom[^h53].
###### 13
And there came[^h935] a messenger[^h5046] to David[^h1732], saying[^h559], The hearts[^h3820] of the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] are after[^h310] Absalom[^h53].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto all his servants[^h5650] that were with him at Jerusalem[^h3389], Arise[^h6965], and let us flee[^h1272]; for we shall not else escape[^h6413] from[^h6440] Absalom[^h53]: make speed[^h4116] to depart[^h3212], lest he overtake[^h5381] us suddenly[^h4116], and bring[^h5080] evil[^h7451] upon us, and smite[^h5221] the city[^h5892] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]. 
###### 15
And the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Behold, thy servants[^h5650] are ready to do whatsoever my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] shall appoint[^h977]. 
###### 16
And the king[^h4428] went forth[^h3318], and all his household[^h1004] after[^h7272] him. And the king[^h4428] left[^h5800] ten[^h6235] women[^h802], which were concubines[^h6370], to keep[^h8104] the house[^h1004]. 
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] went forth[^h3318], and all the people[^h5971] after[^h7272] him, and tarried[^h5975] in a place[^h1004] that was far off[^h4801] [^h1023].
###### 18
And all his servants[^h5650] passed on[^h5674] beside[^h3027] him; and all the Cherethites[^h3774], and all the Pelethites[^h6432], and all the Gittites[^h1663], six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] which came[^h935] after[^h7272] him from Gath[^h1661], passed on[^h5674] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 19
Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428] to Ittai[^h863] the Gittite[^h1663], Wherefore goest[^h3212] thou also with us? return[^h7725] to thy place[^h4725], and abide[^h3427] with the king[^h4428]: for thou art a stranger[^h5237], and also an exile[^h1540].
###### 20
Whereas thou camest[^h935] but yesterday[^h8543], should I this day[^h3117] make thee go[^h3212] up and down[^h5128] [^h5128] with us? seeing I go[^h1980] whither I may, return[^h7725] thou, and take back[^h7725] thy brethren[^h251]: mercy[^h2617] and truth[^h571] be with thee. 
###### 21
And Ittai[^h863] answered[^h6030] the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] liveth[^h2416], surely in what place[^h4725] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] shall be, whether in death[^h4194] or life[^h2416], even there also will thy servant[^h5650] be.
###### 22
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Ittai[^h863], Go[^h3212] and pass over[^h5674]. And Ittai[^h863] the Gittite[^h1663] passed over[^h5674], and all his men[^h582], and all the little ones[^h2945] that were with him.
###### 23
And all the country[^h776] wept[^h1058] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], and all the people[^h5971] passed over[^h5674]: the king[^h4428] also himself passed over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939], and all the people[^h5971] passed over[^h5674], toward[^h6440] the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 24
And lo Zadok[^h6659] also, and all the Levites[^h3881] were with him, bearing[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430]: and they set down[^h3332] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]; and Abiathar[^h54] went up[^h5927], until all the people[^h5971] had done[^h8552] passing[^h5674] out of the city[^h5892].
###### 25
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Zadok[^h6659], Carry back[^h7725] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] into the city[^h5892]: if I shall find[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], he will bring me again[^h7725], and shew[^h7200] me both it, and his habitation[^h5116]:
###### 26
But if he thus say[^h559], I have no delight[^h2654] in thee; behold, here am I, let him do[^h6213] to me as seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto him.
###### 27
The king[^h4428] said[^h559] also unto Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], Art not thou a seer[^h7200]? return[^h7725] into the city[^h5892] in peace[^h7965], and your two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] with you, Ahimaaz[^h290] thy son[^h1121], and Jonathan[^h3083] the son[^h1121] of Abiathar[^h54].
###### 28
See[^h7200], I will tarry[^h4102] in the plain[^h6160] [^h5679] of the wilderness[^h4057], until there come[^h935] word[^h1697] from you to certify[^h5046] me.
###### 29
Zadok[^h6659] therefore and Abiathar[^h54] carried[^h7725] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] again[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389]: and they tarried[^h3427] there.
###### 30
And David[^h1732] went up[^h5927] by the ascent[^h4608] of mount Olivet[^h2132], and wept[^h1058] as he went up[^h5927], and had his head[^h7218] covered[^h2645], and he went[^h1980] barefoot[^h3182]: and all the people[^h5971] that was with him covered[^h2645] every man[^h376] his head[^h7218], and they went up[^h5927], weeping[^h1058] as they went up[^h5927]. 
###### 31
And one told[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Ahithophel[^h302] is among the conspirators[^h7194] with Absalom[^h53]. And David[^h1732] said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068], I pray thee, turn the counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302] into foolishness[^h5528].
###### 32
And it came to pass, that when David[^h1732] was come[^h935] to the top[^h7218] of the mount, where he worshipped[^h7812] God[^h430], behold, Hushai[^h2365] the Archite[^h757] came to meet[^h7125] him with his coat[^h3801] rent[^h7167], and earth[^h127] upon his head[^h7218]:
###### 33
Unto whom David[^h1732] said[^h559], If thou passest on[^h5674] with me, then thou shalt be a burden[^h4853] unto me:
###### 34
But if thou return[^h7725] to the city[^h5892], and say[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], I will be thy servant[^h5650], O king[^h4428]; as I have been thy father's[^h1] servant[^h5650] hitherto[^h227], so will I now also be thy servant[^h5650]: then mayest thou for me defeat[^h6565] the counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302].
###### 35
And hast thou not there with thee Zadok[^h6659] and Abiathar[^h54] the priests[^h3548]? therefore it shall be, that what thing[^h1697] soever thou shalt hear[^h8085] out of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], thou shalt tell[^h5046] it to Zadok[^h6659] and Abiathar[^h54] the priests[^h3548].
###### 36
Behold, they have there with them their two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], Ahimaaz[^h290] Zadok's[^h6659] son, and Jonathan[^h3083] Abiathar's[^h54] son; and by them[^h3027] ye shall send[^h7971] unto me every thing[^h1697] that ye can hear[^h8085].
###### 37
So Hushai[^h2365] David's[^h1732] friend[^h7463] came[^h935] into the city[^h5892], and Absalom[^h53] came[^h935] into Jerusalem[^h3389].

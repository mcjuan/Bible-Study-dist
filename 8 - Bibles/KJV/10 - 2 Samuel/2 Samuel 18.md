###### 1
And David[^h1732] numbered[^h6485] the people[^h5971] that were with him, and set[^h7760] captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505] and captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967] over them.
###### 2
And David[^h1732] sent forth[^h7971] a third part[^h7992] of the people[^h5971] under the hand[^h3027] of Joab[^h3097], and a third part[^h7992] under the hand[^h3027] of Abishai[^h52] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], Joab's[^h3097] brother[^h251], and a third part[^h7992] under the hand[^h3027] of Ittai[^h863] the Gittite[^h1663]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], I will surely[^h3318] go forth[^h3318] with you myself[^h589] also.
###### 3
But the people[^h5971] answered[^h559], Thou shalt not go forth[^h3318]: for if we flee[^h5127] away[^h5127], they will not care[^h7760] [^h3820] for us; neither if half[^h2677] of us die[^h4191], will they care[^h7760] [^h3820] for us: but now thou art worth[^h3644] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] of us: therefore now it is better[^h2896] that thou succour[^h5826] [^h5826] us out of the city[^h5892].   
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto them, What seemeth[^h5869] you best[^h3190] I will do[^h6213]. And the king[^h4428] stood[^h5975] by the gate[^h8179] side[^h3027], and all the people[^h5971] came out[^h3318] by hundreds[^h3967] and by thousands[^h505].
###### 5
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Joab[^h3097] and Abishai[^h52] and Ittai[^h863], saying[^h559], Deal gently[^h328] for my sake with the young man[^h5288], even with Absalom[^h53]. And all the people[^h5971] heard[^h8085] when the king[^h4428] gave all the captains[^h8269] charge[^h6680] concerning[^h1697] Absalom[^h53].
###### 6
So the people[^h5971] went out[^h3318] into the field[^h7704] against[^h7125] Israel[^h3478]: and the battle[^h4421] was in the wood[^h3293] of Ephraim[^h669];
###### 7
Where the people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478] were slain[^h5062] before[^h6440] the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732], and there was there a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4046] that day[^h3117] of twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] men.
###### 8
For the battle[^h4421] was there scattered[^h6327] over the face[^h6440] of all the country[^h776]: and the wood[^h3293] devoured[^h398] more[^h7235] people[^h5971] that day[^h3117] than the sword[^h2719] devoured[^h398]. 
###### 9
And Absalom[^h53] met[^h7122] the servants[^h6440] [^h5650] of David[^h1732]. And Absalom[^h53] rode[^h7392] upon a mule[^h6505], and the mule[^h6505] went[^h935] under the thick boughs[^h7730] of a great[^h1419] oak[^h424], and his head[^h7218] caught hold[^h2388] of the oak[^h424], and he was taken up[^h5414] between the heaven[^h8064] and the earth[^h776]; and the mule[^h6505] that was under him went away[^h5674].
###### 10
And a certain[^h259] man[^h376] saw[^h7200] it, and told[^h5046] Joab[^h3097], and said[^h559], Behold, I saw[^h7200] Absalom[^h53] hanged[^h8518] in an oak[^h424].
###### 11
And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559] unto the man[^h376] that told[^h5046] him, And, behold, thou sawest[^h7200] him, and why didst thou not smite[^h5221] him there to the ground[^h776]? and I would have given[^h5414] thee ten[^h6235] shekels of silver[^h3701], and a[^h259] girdle[^h2290].
###### 12
And the man[^h376] said[^h559] unto Joab[^h3097], Though[^h3863] I should receive[^h8254] a thousand[^h505] shekels of silver[^h3701] in mine hand[^h3709], yet would I not put forth[^h7971] mine hand[^h3027] against the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121]: for in our hearing[^h241] the king[^h4428] charged[^h6680] thee and Abishai[^h52] and Ittai[^h863], saying[^h559], Beware[^h8104] that none touch the young man[^h5288] Absalom[^h53].  
###### 13
Otherwise[^h176] I should have wrought[^h6213] falsehood[^h8267] against mine own life[^h5315]: for there is no matter[^h1697] hid[^h3582] from the king[^h4428], and thou thyself wouldest have set[^h3320] thyself against me.
###### 14
Then said[^h559] Joab[^h3097], I may not tarry[^h3176] thus with thee[^h6440]. And he took[^h3947] three[^h7969] darts[^h7626] in his hand[^h3709], and thrust[^h8628] them through the heart[^h3820] of Absalom[^h53], while he was yet alive[^h2416] in the midst of the oak[^h424].  
###### 15
And ten[^h6235] young men[^h5288] that bare[^h5375] Joab's[^h3097] armour[^h3627] compassed about[^h5437] and smote[^h5221] Absalom[^h53], and slew[^h4191] him.
###### 16
And Joab[^h3097] blew[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782], and the people[^h5971] returned[^h7725] from pursuing[^h7291] after[^h310] Israel[^h3478]: for Joab[^h3097] held back[^h2820] the people[^h5971].
###### 17
And they took[^h3947] Absalom[^h53], and cast[^h7993] him into a great[^h1419] pit[^h6354] in the wood[^h3293], and laid[^h5324] a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] heap[^h1530] of stones[^h68] upon him: and all Israel[^h3478] fled[^h5127] every one[^h376] to his tent[^h168].
###### 18
Now Absalom[^h53] in his lifetime[^h2416] had taken[^h3947] and reared up[^h5324] for himself a pillar[^h4678], which is in the king's[^h4428] dale[^h6010]: for he said[^h559], I have no son[^h1121] to keep my name[^h8034] in remembrance[^h2142]: and he called[^h7121] the pillar[^h4678] after his own name[^h8034]: and it is called[^h7121] unto this day[^h3117], Absalom's[^h53] place[^h3027].
###### 19
Then said[^h559] Ahimaaz[^h290] the son[^h1121] of Zadok[^h6659], Let me now run[^h7323], and bear[^h1319] the king[^h4428] tidings[^h1319], how that the LORD[^h3068] hath avenged[^h8199] him of his enemies[^h3027] [^h341]. 
###### 20
And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559] unto him, Thou[^h376] shalt not bear tidings[^h1309] this day[^h3117], but thou shalt bear tidings[^h1319] another[^h312] day[^h3117]: but this day[^h3117] thou shalt bear no tidings[^h1319], because the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121] is dead[^h4191]. 
###### 21
Then said[^h559] Joab[^h3097] to Cushi[^h3569], Go[^h3212] tell[^h5046] the king[^h4428] what thou hast seen[^h7200]. And Cushi[^h3569] bowed[^h7812] himself unto Joab[^h3097], and ran[^h7323].
###### 22
Then said[^h559] Ahimaaz[^h290] the son[^h1121] of Zadok[^h6659] yet again[^h3254] to Joab[^h3097], But howsoever[^h4100], let me, I pray thee, also run[^h7323] after[^h310] Cushi[^h3569]. And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559], Wherefore wilt thou run[^h7323], my son[^h1121], seeing that thou hast no tidings[^h1309] ready[^h4672]?  
###### 23
But howsoever, said he, let me run[^h7323]. And he said[^h559] unto him, Run[^h7323]. Then Ahimaaz[^h290] ran[^h7323] by the way[^h1870] of the plain[^h3603], and overran[^h5674] Cushi[^h3569].
###### 24
And David[^h1732] sat[^h3427] between the two[^h8147] gates[^h8179]: and the watchman[^h6822] went up[^h3212] to the roof[^h1406] over the gate[^h8179] unto the wall[^h2346], and lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and behold a man[^h376] running[^h7323] alone.
###### 25
And the watchman[^h6822] cried[^h7121], and told[^h5046] the king[^h4428]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], If he be alone, there is tidings[^h1309] in his mouth[^h6310]. And he came[^h3212] apace[^h1980], and drew near[^h7131].
###### 26
And the watchman[^h6822] saw[^h7200] another[^h312] man[^h376] running[^h7323]: and the watchman[^h6822] called[^h7121] unto the porter[^h7778], and said[^h559], Behold another man[^h376] running[^h7323] alone. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], He also bringeth tidings[^h1319].
###### 27
And the watchman[^h6822] said[^h559], Me thinketh[^h7200] the running[^h4794] of the foremost[^h7223] is like the running[^h4794] of Ahimaaz[^h290] the son[^h1121] of Zadok[^h6659]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], He is a good[^h2896] man[^h376], and cometh[^h935] with good[^h2896] tidings[^h1309]. 
###### 28
And Ahimaaz[^h290] called[^h7121], and said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], All is well[^h7965]. And he fell down[^h7812] to the earth[^h776] upon his face[^h639] before the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], which hath delivered up[^h5462] the men[^h582] that lifted up[^h5375] their hand[^h3027] against my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428].  
###### 29
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Is the young man[^h5288] Absalom[^h53] safe[^h7965]? And Ahimaaz[^h290] answered[^h559], When Joab[^h3097] sent[^h7971] the king's[^h4428] servant[^h5650], and me thy servant[^h5650], I saw[^h7200] a great[^h1419] tumult[^h1995], but I knew[^h3045] not what it was. 
###### 30
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Turn aside[^h5437], and stand[^h3320] here[^h3541]. And he turned aside[^h5437], and stood still[^h5975].
###### 31
And, behold, Cushi[^h3569] came[^h935]; and Cushi[^h3569] said[^h559], Tidings[^h1319], my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath avenged[^h8199] thee this day[^h3117] of all them[^h3027] that rose up[^h6965] against thee. 
###### 32
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Cushi[^h3569], Is the young man[^h5288] Absalom[^h53] safe[^h7965]? And Cushi[^h3569] answered[^h559], The enemies[^h341] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], and all that rise[^h6965] against thee to do thee hurt[^h7451], be as that young man[^h5288] is.
###### 33
And the king[^h4428] was much moved[^h7264], and went up[^h5927] to the chamber[^h5944] over the gate[^h8179], and wept[^h1058]: and as he went[^h3212], thus he said[^h559], O my son[^h1121] Absalom[^h53], my son[^h1121], my son[^h1121] Absalom[^h53]! would God I had died[^h4191] for thee[^h5414], O Absalom[^h53], my son[^h1121], my son[^h1121]!

###### 1
And it came to pass, after the year[^h8141] was expired[^h8666], at the time[^h6256] when kings[^h4428] [^h4397] go forth[^h3318] to battle, that David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] Joab[^h3097], and his servants[^h5650] with him, and all Israel[^h3478]; and they destroyed[^h7843] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and besieged[^h6696] Rabbah[^h7237]. But David[^h1732] tarried still[^h3427] at Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 2
And it came to pass in an eveningtide[^h6153] [^h6256], that David[^h1732] arose[^h6965] from off his bed[^h4904], and walked[^h1980] upon the roof[^h1406] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]: and from the roof[^h1406] he saw[^h7200] a woman[^h802] washing[^h7364] herself; and the woman[^h802] was very[^h3966] beautiful[^h2896] to look upon[^h4758].
###### 3
And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] and enquired[^h1875] after the woman[^h802]. And one said[^h559], Is not this Bathsheba[^h1339], the daughter[^h1323] of Eliam[^h463], the wife[^h802] of Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850]?
###### 4
And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397], and took[^h3947] her; and she came in[^h935] unto him, and he lay[^h7901] with her; for she was purified[^h6942] from her uncleanness[^h2932]: and she returned[^h7725] unto her house[^h1004]. 
###### 5
And the woman[^h802] conceived[^h2029], and sent[^h7971] and told[^h5046] David[^h1732], and said[^h559], I am with child[^h2030].
###### 6
And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] to Joab[^h3097], saying, Send[^h7971] me Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850]. And Joab[^h3097] sent[^h7971] Uriah[^h223] to David[^h1732].
###### 7
And when Uriah[^h223] was come[^h935] unto him, David[^h1732] demanded[^h7592] of him how Joab[^h3097] did[^h7965], and how the people[^h5971] did[^h7965], and how the war[^h4421] prospered[^h7965]. 
###### 8
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Uriah[^h223], Go down[^h3381] to thy house[^h1004], and wash[^h7364] thy feet[^h7272]. And Uriah[^h223] departed out[^h3318] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and there followed[^h310] him a mess[^h4864] of meat from the king[^h4428]. 
###### 9
But Uriah[^h223] slept[^h7901] at the door[^h6607] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004] with all the servants[^h5650] of his lord[^h113], and went not down[^h3381] to his house[^h1004].
###### 10
And when they had told[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Uriah[^h223] went not down[^h3381] unto his house[^h1004], David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Uriah[^h223], Camest[^h935] thou not from thy journey[^h1870]? why then didst thou not go down[^h3381] unto thine house[^h1004]?
###### 11
And Uriah[^h223] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], The ark[^h727], and Israel[^h3478], and Judah[^h3063], abide[^h3427] in tents[^h5521]; and my lord[^h113] Joab[^h3097], and the servants[^h5650] of my lord[^h113], are encamped[^h2583] in the open[^h6440] fields[^h7704]; shall I[^h589] then go[^h935] into mine house[^h1004], to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354], and to lie[^h7901] with my wife[^h802]? as thou livest[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], I will not do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 12
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Uriah[^h223], Tarry[^h3427] here to day[^h3117] also, and to morrow[^h4279] I will let thee depart[^h7971]. So Uriah[^h223] abode[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] that day[^h3117], and the morrow[^h4283].
###### 13
And when David[^h1732] had called[^h7121] him, he did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354] before[^h6440] him; and he made him drunk[^h7937]: and at even[^h6153] he went out[^h3318] to lie[^h7901] on his bed[^h4904] with the servants[^h5650] of his lord[^h113], but went not down[^h3381] to his house[^h1004].
###### 14
And it came to pass in the morning[^h1242], that David[^h1732] wrote[^h3789] a letter[^h5612] to Joab[^h3097], and sent[^h7971] it by the hand[^h3027] of Uriah[^h223].
###### 15
And he wrote[^h3789] in the letter[^h5612], saying[^h559], Set[^h3051] ye Uriah[^h223] in the forefront[^h6440] [^h4136] of the hottest[^h2389] battle[^h4421], and retire[^h7725] ye from him[^h310], that he may be smitten[^h5221], and die[^h4191].  
###### 16
And it came to pass, when Joab[^h3097] observed[^h8104] the city[^h5892], that he assigned[^h5414] Uriah[^h223] unto a place[^h4725] where he knew[^h3045] that valiant[^h2428] men[^h582] were.
###### 17
And the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] went out[^h3318], and fought[^h3898] with Joab[^h3097]: and there fell[^h5307] some of the people[^h5971] of the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732]; and Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850] died[^h4191] also.
###### 18
Then Joab[^h3097] sent[^h7971] and told[^h5046] David[^h1732] all the things[^h1697] concerning the war[^h4421];
###### 19
And charged[^h6680] the messenger[^h4397], saying[^h559], When thou hast made an end[^h3615] of telling[^h1696] the matters[^h1697] of the war[^h4421] unto the king[^h4428],
###### 20
And if so be that the king's[^h4428] wrath[^h2534] arise[^h5927], and he say[^h559] unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh[^h5066] unto the city[^h5892] when ye did fight[^h3898]? knew[^h3045] ye not that they would shoot[^h3384] from the wall[^h2346]?
###### 21
Who smote[^h5221] Abimelech[^h40] the son[^h1121] of Jerubbesheth[^h3380]? did not a woman[^h802] cast[^h7993] a piece[^h6400] of a millstone[^h7393] upon him from the wall[^h2346], that he died[^h4191] in Thebez[^h8405]? why went ye nigh[^h5066] the wall[^h2346]? then say[^h559] thou, Thy servant[^h5650] Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850] is dead[^h4191] also.
###### 22
So the messenger[^h4397] went[^h3212], and came[^h935] and shewed[^h5046] David[^h1732] all that Joab[^h3097] had sent[^h7971] him for.
###### 23
And the messenger[^h4397] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Surely the men[^h582] prevailed[^h1396] against us, and came out[^h3318] unto us into the field[^h7704], and we were upon them even unto the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179].
###### 24
And the shooters[^h3384] shot[^h3384] from off the wall[^h2346] upon thy servants[^h5650]; and some of the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650] be dead[^h4191], and thy servant[^h5650] Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850] is dead[^h4191] also.
###### 25
Then David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto the messenger[^h4397], Thus shalt thou say[^h559] unto Joab[^h3097], Let not this thing[^h1697] displease[^h3415] [^h5869] thee, for the sword[^h2719] devoureth[^h398] one as well as another[^h2090]: make thy battle[^h4421] more strong[^h2388] against the city[^h5892], and overthrow[^h2040] it: and encourage[^h2388] thou him.  
###### 26
And when the wife[^h802] of Uriah[^h223] heard[^h8085] that Uriah[^h223] her husband[^h376] was dead[^h4191], she mourned[^h5594] for her husband[^h1167].
###### 27
And when the mourning[^h60] was past[^h5674], David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] and fetched[^h622] her to his house[^h1004], and she became his wife[^h802], and bare[^h3205] him a son[^h1121]. But the thing[^h1697] that David[^h1732] had done[^h6213] displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] the LORD[^h3068].

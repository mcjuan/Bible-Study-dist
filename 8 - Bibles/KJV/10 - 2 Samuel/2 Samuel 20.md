###### 1
And there happened[^h7122] to be there a man[^h376] of Belial[^h1100], whose name[^h8034] was Sheba[^h7652], the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075], a Benjamite[^h1145]: and he blew[^h8628] a trumpet[^h7782], and said[^h559], We have no part[^h2506] in David[^h1732], neither have we inheritance[^h5159] in the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448]: every[^h376] man[^h376] to his tents[^h168], O Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
So every man[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927] from after[^h310] David[^h1732], and followed[^h310] Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075]: but the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] clave[^h1692] unto their king[^h4428], from Jordan[^h3383] even to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And David[^h1732] came[^h935] to his house[^h1004] at Jerusalem[^h3389]; and the king[^h4428] took[^h3947] the ten[^h6235] women[^h802] his concubines[^h6370], whom he had left[^h3240] to keep[^h8104] the house[^h1004], and put[^h5414] them in ward[^h4931], and fed[^h3557] them, but went not in[^h935] unto them. So they were shut up[^h6887] unto the day[^h3117] of their death[^h4191], living[^h2424] in widowhood[^h491].   
###### 4
Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428] to Amasa[^h6021], Assemble[^h2199] me the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] within three[^h7969] days[^h3117], and be thou here present[^h5975]. 
###### 5
So Amasa[^h6021] went[^h3212] to assemble[^h2199] the men of Judah[^h3063]: but he tarried longer[^h309] [^h3186] than the set time[^h4150] which he had appointed[^h3259] him. 
###### 6
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abishai[^h52], Now shall Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075] do us more harm[^h3415] than did Absalom[^h53]: take[^h3947] thou thy lord's[^h113] servants[^h5650], and pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] him, lest he get[^h4672] him fenced[^h1219] cities[^h5892], and escape[^h5337] us[^h5869]. 
###### 7
And there went out[^h3318] after[^h310] him Joab's[^h3097] men[^h582], and the Cherethites[^h3774], and the Pelethites[^h6432], and all the mighty men[^h1368]: and they went out[^h3318] of Jerusalem[^h3389], to pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075].
###### 8
When they were at the great[^h1419] stone[^h68] which is in Gibeon[^h1391], Amasa[^h6021] went[^h935] before[^h6440] them. And Joab's[^h3097] garment[^h4055] that he had put on[^h3830] was girded[^h2296] unto him, and upon it a girdle[^h2289] with a sword[^h2719] fastened[^h6775] upon his loins[^h4975] in the sheath[^h8593] thereof; and as he went forth[^h3318] it fell out[^h5307].
###### 9
And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559] to Amasa[^h6021], Art thou in health[^h7965], my brother[^h251]? And Joab[^h3097] took[^h270] Amasa[^h6021] by the beard[^h2206] with the right[^h3225] hand[^h3027] to kiss[^h5401] him.
###### 10
But Amasa[^h6021] took no heed[^h8104] to the sword[^h2719] that was in Joab's[^h3097] hand[^h3027]: so he smote[^h5221] him therewith in the fifth[^h2570] rib, and shed out[^h8210] his bowels[^h4578] to the ground[^h776], and struck him not again[^h8138]; and he died[^h4191]. So Joab[^h3097] and Abishai[^h52] his brother[^h251] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075]. 
###### 11
And one[^h376] of Joab's[^h3097] men[^h5288] stood[^h5975] by him, and said[^h559], He[^h4310] that favoureth[^h2654] Joab[^h3097], and he that is for David[^h1732], let him go after[^h310] Joab[^h3097].
###### 12
And Amasa[^h6021] wallowed[^h1556] in blood[^h1818] in the midst[^h8432] of the highway[^h4546]. And when the man[^h376] saw[^h7200] that all the people[^h5971] stood still[^h5975], he removed[^h5437] Amasa[^h6021] out of the highway[^h4546] into the field[^h7704], and cast[^h7993] a cloth[^h899] upon him, when he saw[^h7200] that every one that came[^h935] by him stood still[^h5975].
###### 13
When he was removed[^h3014] out of the highway[^h4546], all the people[^h376] went on[^h5674] after[^h310] Joab[^h3097], to pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075].
###### 14
And he went[^h5674] through all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] unto Abel[^h59], and to Bethmaachah[^h1038], and all the Berites[^h1276]: and they were gathered together[^h6950] [^h7035], and went[^h935] also after[^h310] him.
###### 15
And they came[^h935] and besieged[^h6696] him in Abel[^h59] of Bethmaachah[^h1038], and they cast up[^h8210] a bank[^h5550] against the city[^h5892], and it stood[^h5975] in the trench[^h2426]: and all the people[^h5971] that were with Joab[^h3097] battered[^h7843] the wall[^h2346], to throw it down[^h5307].  
###### 16
Then cried[^h7121] a wise[^h2450] woman[^h802] out of the city[^h5892], Hear[^h8085], hear[^h8085]; say[^h559], I pray you, unto Joab[^h3097], Come near[^h7126] hither, that I may speak[^h1696] with thee.
###### 17
And when he was come near[^h7126] unto her, the woman[^h802] said[^h559], Art thou Joab[^h3097]? And he answered[^h559], I am he. Then she said[^h559] unto him, Hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of thine handmaid[^h519]. And he answered[^h559], I do hear[^h8085].
###### 18
Then she spake[^h559], saying[^h559], They were wont[^h1696] to speak[^h1696] in old time[^h7223], saying[^h559], They shall surely[^h7592] ask[^h7592] counsel at Abel[^h59]: and so they ended[^h8552] the matter. 
###### 19
I am one of them that are peaceable[^h7999] and faithful[^h539] in Israel[^h3478]: thou seekest[^h1245] to destroy[^h4191] a city[^h5892] and a mother[^h517] in Israel[^h3478]: why wilt thou swallow up[^h1104] the inheritance[^h5159] of the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 20
And Joab[^h3097] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Far be it[^h2486], far be it[^h2486] from me, that I should swallow up[^h1104] or destroy[^h7843].
###### 21
The matter[^h1697] is not so: but a man[^h376] of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075] by name[^h8034], hath lifted up[^h5375] his hand[^h3027] against the king[^h4428], even against David[^h1732]: deliver[^h5414] him only, and I will depart[^h3212] from the city[^h5892]. And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto Joab[^h3097], Behold, his head[^h7218] shall be thrown[^h7993] to thee over[^h1157] the wall[^h2346]. 
###### 22
Then the woman[^h802] went[^h935] unto all the people[^h5971] in her wisdom[^h2451]. And they cut off[^h3772] the head[^h7218] of Sheba[^h7652] the son[^h1121] of Bichri[^h1075], and cast[^h7993] it out to Joab[^h3097]. And he blew[^h8628] a trumpet[^h7782], and they retired[^h6327] from the city[^h5892], every man[^h376] to his tent[^h168]. And Joab[^h3097] returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389] unto the king[^h4428]. 
###### 23
Now Joab[^h3097] was over all the host[^h6635] of Israel[^h3478]: and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] was over the Cherethites[^h3774] [^h3746] and over the Pelethites[^h6432]:
###### 24
And Adoram[^h151] was over the tribute[^h4522]: and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the son[^h1121] of Ahilud[^h286] was recorder[^h2142]: 
###### 25
And Sheva[^h7864] [^h7724] was scribe[^h5608]: and Zadok[^h6659] and Abiathar[^h54] were the priests[^h3548]:
###### 26
And Ira[^h5896] also the Jairite[^h2972] was a chief ruler[^h3548] about David[^h1732].

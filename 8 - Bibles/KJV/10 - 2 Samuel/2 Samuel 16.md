###### 1
And when David[^h1732] was a little[^h4592] past[^h5674] the top[^h7218] of the hill, behold, Ziba[^h6717] the servant[^h5288] of Mephibosheth[^h4648] met[^h7125] him, with a couple[^h6776] of asses[^h2543] saddled[^h2280], and upon them two hundred[^h3967] loaves of bread[^h3899], and an hundred[^h3967] bunches of raisins[^h6778], and an hundred[^h3967] of summer fruits[^h7019], and a bottle[^h5035] of wine[^h3196].
###### 2
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Ziba[^h6717], What meanest thou by these? And Ziba[^h6717] said[^h559], The asses[^h2543] be for the king's[^h4428] household[^h1004] to ride on[^h7392]; and the bread[^h3899] and summer fruit[^h7019] for the young men[^h5288] to eat[^h398]; and the wine[^h3196], that such as be faint[^h3287] in the wilderness[^h4057] may drink[^h8354].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], And where is thy master's[^h113] son[^h1121]? And Ziba[^h6717] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Behold, he abideth[^h3427] at Jerusalem[^h3389]: for he said[^h559], To day[^h3117] shall the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] restore[^h7725] me the kingdom[^h4468] of my father[^h1].
###### 4
Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428] to Ziba[^h6717], Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth[^h4648]. And Ziba[^h6717] said[^h559], I humbly[^h7812] beseech thee that I may find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428]. 
###### 5
And when king[^h4428] David[^h1732] came[^h935] to Bahurim[^h980], behold, thence came out[^h3318] a man[^h376] of the family[^h4940] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], whose name[^h8034] was Shimei[^h8096], the son[^h1121] of Gera[^h1617]: he came forth[^h3318], and cursed[^h7043] still as he came[^h3318]. 
###### 6
And he cast[^h5619] stones[^h68] at David[^h1732], and at all the servants[^h5650] of king[^h4428] David[^h1732]: and all the people[^h5971] and all the mighty men[^h1368] were on his right hand[^h3225] and on his left[^h8040].
###### 7
And thus said[^h559] Shimei[^h8096] when he cursed[^h7043], Come out[^h3318], come out[^h3318], thou bloody[^h1818] man[^h376], and thou man[^h376] of Belial[^h1100]: 
###### 8
The LORD[^h3068] hath returned[^h7725] upon thee all the blood[^h1818] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], in whose stead thou hast reigned[^h4427]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] the kingdom[^h4410] into the hand[^h3027] of Absalom[^h53] thy son[^h1121]: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief[^h7451], because thou art a bloody[^h1818] man[^h376]. 
###### 9
Then said[^h559] Abishai[^h52] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] unto the king[^h4428], Why should this dead[^h4191] dog[^h3611] curse[^h7043] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]? let me go over[^h5674], I pray thee, and take off[^h5493] his head[^h7218].
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], What have I to do with you, ye sons[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870]? so let him curse[^h7043], because the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h559] unto him, Curse[^h7043] David[^h1732]. Who shall then say[^h559], Wherefore hast thou done so[^h6213]?
###### 11
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abishai[^h52], and to all his servants[^h5650], Behold, my son[^h1121], which came forth[^h3318] of my bowels[^h4578], seeketh[^h1245] my life[^h5315]: how much more now may this Benjamite[^h1145] do it? let him alone[^h3240], and let him curse[^h7043]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath bidden[^h559] him.
###### 12
It may be that the LORD[^h3068] will look[^h7200] on mine affliction[^h5869] [^h6040], and that the LORD[^h3068] will requite[^h7725] me good[^h2896] for his cursing[^h7045] this day[^h3117]. 
###### 13
And as David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] went[^h3212] by the way[^h1870], Shimei[^h8096] went along[^h1980] on the hill's[^h2022] side[^h6763] over against[^h5980] him, and cursed[^h7043] as he went[^h1980], and threw[^h5619] stones[^h68] at[^h5980] him, and cast[^h6080] dust[^h6083]. 
###### 14
And the king[^h4428], and all the people[^h5971] that were with him, came[^h935] weary[^h5889], and refreshed[^h5314] themselves there.
###### 15
And Absalom[^h53], and all the people[^h5971] the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and Ahithophel[^h302] with him.
###### 16
And it came to pass, when Hushai[^h2365] the Archite[^h757], David's[^h1732] friend[^h7463], was come[^h935] unto Absalom[^h53], that Hushai[^h2365] said[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], God save[^h2421] the king[^h4428], God save[^h2421] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 17
And Absalom[^h53] said[^h559] to Hushai[^h2365], Is this thy kindness[^h2617] to thy friend[^h7453]? why wentest[^h1980] thou not with thy friend[^h7453]?
###### 18
And Hushai[^h2365] said[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], Nay; but whom the LORD[^h3068], and this people[^h5971], and all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], choose[^h977], his will I be, and with him will I abide[^h3427].
###### 19
And again[^h8145], whom should I serve[^h5647]? should I not serve in the presence[^h6440] of his son[^h1121]? as I have served[^h5647] in thy father's[^h1] presence[^h6440], so will I be in thy presence[^h6440].
###### 20
Then said[^h559] Absalom[^h53] to Ahithophel[^h302], Give[^h3051] counsel[^h6098] among you what we shall do[^h6213].
###### 21
And Ahithophel[^h302] said[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], Go in[^h935] unto thy father's[^h1] concubines[^h6370], which he hath left[^h3240] to keep[^h8104] the house[^h1004]; and all Israel[^h3478] shall hear[^h8085] that thou art abhorred[^h887] of thy father[^h1]: then shall the hands[^h3027] of all that are with thee be strong[^h2388].
###### 22
So they spread[^h5186] Absalom[^h53] a tent[^h168] upon the top of the house[^h1406]; and Absalom[^h53] went in[^h935] unto his father's[^h1] concubines[^h6370] in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478].
###### 23
And the counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302], which he counselled[^h3289] in those days[^h3117], was as if a man[^h376] had enquired[^h7592] at the oracle[^h1697] of God[^h430]: so was all the counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302] both with David[^h1732] and with Absalom[^h53].

###### 1
Now Joab[^h3097] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] perceived[^h3045] that the king's[^h4428] heart[^h3820] was toward Absalom[^h53].
###### 2
And Joab[^h3097] sent[^h7971] to Tekoah[^h8620], and fetched[^h3947] thence a wise[^h2450] woman[^h802], and said[^h559] unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner[^h56], and put on[^h3847] now mourning[^h60] apparel[^h899], and anoint[^h5480] not thyself with oil[^h8081], but be as a woman[^h802] that had a long[^h7227] time[^h3117] mourned[^h56] for the dead[^h4191]:
###### 3
And come[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and speak[^h1696] on this manner[^h1697] unto him. So Joab[^h3097] put[^h7760] the words[^h1697] in her mouth[^h6310].
###### 4
And when the woman[^h802] of Tekoah[^h8621] spake[^h559] to the king[^h4428], she fell[^h5307] on her face[^h639] to the ground[^h776], and did obeisance[^h7812], and said[^h559], Help[^h3467], O king[^h4428]. 
###### 5
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered[^h559], I am indeed[^h61] a widow[^h490] woman[^h802], and mine husband[^h376] is dead[^h4191].
###### 6
And thy handmaid[^h8198] had two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], and they two[^h8147] strove together[^h5327] in the field[^h7704], and there was none to part[^h5337] them, but the one[^h259] smote[^h5221] the other[^h259], and slew[^h4191] him. 
###### 7
And, behold, the whole family[^h4940] is risen[^h6965] against thine handmaid[^h8198], and they said[^h559], Deliver[^h5414] him that smote[^h5221] his brother[^h251], that we may kill[^h4191] him, for the life[^h5315] of his brother[^h251] whom he slew[^h2026]; and we will destroy[^h8045] the heir[^h3423] also: and so they shall quench[^h3518] my coal[^h1513] which is left[^h7760], and shall not leave[^h7604] to my husband[^h376] neither name[^h8034] nor remainder[^h7611] upon[^h6440] the earth[^h127]. 
###### 8
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], Go[^h3212] to thine house[^h1004], and I will give charge[^h6680] concerning thee.
###### 9
And the woman[^h802] of Tekoah[^h8621] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], My lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], the iniquity[^h5771] be on me, and on my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]: and the king[^h4428] and his throne[^h3678] be guiltless[^h5355].
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Whosoever saith[^h1696] ought unto thee, bring[^h935] him to me, and he shall not touch[^h5060] thee any more[^h3254].
###### 11
Then said[^h559] she, I pray thee, let the king[^h4428] remember[^h2142] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] to destroy[^h7843] any more[^h7235], lest they destroy[^h8045] my son[^h1121]. And he said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], there shall not one hair[^h8185] of thy son[^h1121] fall[^h5307] to the earth[^h776]. 
###### 12
Then the woman[^h802] said[^h559], Let thine handmaid[^h8198], I pray thee, speak[^h1696] one word[^h1697] unto my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]. And he said[^h559], Say on[^h1696].
###### 13
And the woman[^h802] said[^h559], Wherefore then hast thou thought[^h2803] such a thing against the people[^h5971] of God[^h430]? for the king[^h4428] doth speak[^h1696] this thing[^h1697] as one which is faulty[^h818], in that the king[^h4428] doth not fetch home again[^h7725] his banished[^h5080].
###### 14
For we must needs[^h4191] die[^h4191], and are as water[^h4325] spilt[^h5064] on the ground[^h776], which cannot be gathered up again[^h622]; neither doth God[^h430] respect[^h5375] any person[^h5315]: yet doth he devise[^h2803] means[^h4284], that his banished[^h5080] be not expelled[^h5080] from him. 
###### 15
Now therefore that I am come[^h935] to speak[^h1696] of this thing[^h1697] unto my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], it is because the people[^h5971] have made me afraid[^h3372]: and thy handmaid[^h8198] said[^h559], I will now speak[^h1696] unto the king[^h4428]; it may be that the king[^h4428] will perform[^h6213] the request[^h1697] of his handmaid[^h519].
###### 16
For the king[^h4428] will hear[^h8085], to deliver[^h5337] his handmaid[^h519] out of the hand[^h3709] of the man[^h376] that would destroy[^h8045] me and my son[^h1121] together[^h3162] out of the inheritance[^h5159] of God[^h430].
###### 17
Then thine handmaid[^h8198] said[^h559], The word[^h1697] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] shall now be comfortable[^h4496]: for as an angel[^h4397] of God[^h430], so is my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] to discern[^h8085] good[^h2896] and bad[^h7451]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will be with thee.  
###### 18
Then the king[^h4428] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], Hide[^h3582] not from me, I pray thee, the thing[^h1697] that I shall ask[^h7592] thee. And the woman[^h802] said[^h559], Let my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] now speak[^h1696].
###### 19
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Is not the hand[^h3027] of Joab[^h3097] with thee in all this? And the woman[^h802] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], As thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], none[^h376] can[^h786] turn to the right hand[^h3231] or to the left[^h8041] from ought that my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] hath spoken[^h1696]: for thy servant[^h5650] Joab[^h3097], he bade[^h6680] me, and he put[^h7760] all these words[^h1697] in the mouth[^h6310] of thine handmaid[^h8198]:
###### 20
To[^h5668] fetch about[^h5437] this form[^h6440] of speech[^h1697] hath thy servant[^h5650] Joab[^h3097] done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]: and my lord[^h113] is wise[^h2450], according to the wisdom[^h2451] of an angel[^h4397] of God[^h430], to know[^h3045] all things that are in the earth[^h776].
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Joab[^h3097], Behold now, I have done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]: go[^h3212] therefore, bring[^h7725] the young man[^h5288] Absalom[^h53] again[^h7725].
###### 22
And Joab[^h3097] fell[^h5307] to the ground[^h776] on his face[^h6440], and bowed[^h7812] himself, and thanked[^h1288] the king[^h4428]: and Joab[^h3097] said[^h559], To day[^h3117] thy servant[^h5650] knoweth[^h3045] that I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], in that the king[^h4428] hath fulfilled[^h6213] the request[^h1697] of his servant[^h5650].  
###### 23
So Joab[^h3097] arose[^h6965] and went[^h3212] to Geshur[^h1650], and brought[^h935] Absalom[^h53] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 24
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Let him turn[^h5437] to his own house[^h1004], and let him not see[^h7200] my face[^h6440]. So Absalom[^h53] returned[^h5437] to his own house[^h1004], and saw[^h7200] not the king's[^h4428] face[^h6440].
###### 25
But in all Israel[^h3478] there was none[^h376] to be so much[^h3966] praised[^h1984] as Absalom[^h53] for his beauty[^h3303]: from the sole[^h3709] of his foot[^h7272] even to the crown of his head[^h6936] there was no blemish[^h3971] in him. 
###### 26
And when he polled[^h1548] his head[^h7218], (for it was at every year's[^h3117] [^h3117] end[^h7093] that he polled[^h1548] it: because the hair was heavy[^h3513] on him, therefore he polled[^h1548] it:) he weighed[^h8254] the hair[^h8181] of his head[^h7218] at two hundred[^h3967] shekels[^h8255] after the king's[^h4428] weight[^h68].
###### 27
And unto Absalom[^h53] there were born[^h3205] three[^h7969] sons[^h1121], and one[^h259] daughter[^h1323], whose name[^h8034] was Tamar[^h8559]: she was a woman[^h802] of a fair[^h3303] countenance[^h4758].
###### 28
So Absalom[^h53] dwelt[^h3427] two full[^h3117] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and saw[^h7200] not the king's[^h4428] face[^h6440].
###### 29
Therefore Absalom[^h53] sent[^h7971] for Joab[^h3097], to have sent[^h7971] him to the king[^h4428]; but he would[^h14] not come[^h935] to him: and when he sent again[^h7971] the second time[^h8145], he would[^h14] not come[^h935].
###### 30
Therefore he said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], See[^h7200], Joab's[^h3097] field[^h2513] is near[^h413] mine[^h3027], and he hath barley[^h8184] there; go[^h3212] and set[^h3341] it on fire[^h784]. And Absalom's[^h53] servants[^h5650] set[^h3341] the field[^h2513] on fire[^h784]. 
###### 31
Then Joab[^h3097] arose[^h6965], and came[^h935] to Absalom[^h53] unto his house[^h1004], and said[^h559] unto him, Wherefore have thy servants[^h5650] set[^h3341] my field[^h2513] on fire[^h784]?
###### 32
And Absalom[^h53] answered[^h559] Joab[^h3097], Behold, I sent[^h7971] unto thee, saying[^h559], Come[^h935] hither, that I may send[^h7971] thee to the king[^h4428], to say[^h559], Wherefore am I come[^h935] from Geshur[^h1650]? it had been good[^h2896] for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see[^h7200] the king's[^h4428] face[^h6440]; and if there be[^h3426] any iniquity[^h5771] in me, let him kill[^h4191] me.
###### 33
So Joab[^h3097] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and told[^h5046] him: and when he had called[^h7121] for Absalom[^h53], he came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and bowed[^h7812] himself on his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]: and the king[^h4428] kissed[^h5401] Absalom[^h53].

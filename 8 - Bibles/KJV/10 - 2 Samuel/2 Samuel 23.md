###### 1
Now these be the last[^h314] words[^h1697] of David[^h1732]. David[^h1732] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] said[^h5002], and the man[^h1397] who was raised up[^h6965] on high[^h5920], the anointed[^h4899] of the God[^h430] of Jacob[^h3290], and the sweet[^h5273] psalmist[^h2158] of Israel[^h3478], said[^h5002],
###### 2
The Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] by me, and his word[^h4405] was in my tongue[^h3956].
###### 3
The God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], the Rock[^h6697] of Israel[^h3478] spake[^h1696] to me, He that ruleth[^h4910] over men[^h120] must be just[^h6662], ruling[^h4910] in the fear[^h3374] of God[^h430]. 
###### 4
And he shall be as the light[^h216] of the morning[^h1242], when the sun[^h8121] riseth[^h2224], even a morning[^h1242] without[^h3808] clouds[^h5645]; as the tender grass[^h1877] springing out of the earth[^h776] by clear shining[^h5051] after rain[^h4306].
###### 5
Although my house[^h1004] be not so with God[^h410]; yet he hath made[^h7760] with me an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285], ordered[^h6186] in all things, and sure[^h8104]: for this is all my salvation[^h3468], and all my desire[^h2656], although he make it not to grow[^h6779].
###### 6
But the sons of Belial[^h1100] shall be all of them as thorns[^h6975] thrust away[^h5074], because they cannot be taken[^h3947] with hands[^h3027]:
###### 7
But the man[^h376] that shall touch[^h5060] them must be fenced[^h4390] with iron[^h1270] and the staff[^h6086] of a spear[^h2595]; and they shall be utterly[^h8313] burned[^h8313] with fire[^h784] in the same place[^h7675]. 
###### 8
These be the names[^h8034] of the mighty men[^h1368] whom David[^h1732] had: The Tachmonite[^h8461] that sat[^h3427] in the seat[^h7675] [^h3429], chief[^h7218] among the captains[^h7991]; the same was Adino[^h5722] the Eznite[^h6112]: he lift up his spear against eight[^h8083] hundred[^h3967], whom he slew[^h2491] at one[^h259] time[^h6471]. 
###### 9
And after[^h310] him was Eleazar[^h499] the son[^h1121] of Dodo[^h1734] the Ahohite[^h266], one of the three[^h7969] mighty men[^h1368] with David[^h1732], when they defied[^h2778] the Philistines[^h6430] that were there gathered together[^h622] to battle[^h4421], and the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] were gone away[^h5927]:
###### 10
He arose[^h6965], and smote[^h5221] the Philistines[^h6430] until[^h3588] his hand[^h3027] was weary[^h3021], and his hand[^h3027] clave[^h1692] unto the sword[^h2719]: and the LORD[^h3068] wrought[^h6213] a great[^h1419] victory[^h8668] that day[^h3117]; and the people[^h5971] returned[^h7725] after[^h310] him only to spoil[^h6584].
###### 11
And after[^h310] him was Shammah[^h8048] the son[^h1121] of Agee[^h89] the Hararite[^h2043]. And the Philistines[^h6430] were gathered together[^h622] into a troop[^h2416], where was a piece[^h2513] of ground[^h7704] full[^h4392] of lentiles[^h5742]: and the people[^h5971] fled[^h5127] from[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430]. 
###### 12
But he stood[^h3320] in the midst[^h8432] of the ground[^h2513], and defended[^h5337] it, and slew[^h5221] the Philistines[^h6430]: and the LORD[^h3068] wrought[^h6213] a great[^h1419] victory[^h8668].
###### 13
And three[^h7969] [^h7970] of the thirty[^h7970] chief[^h7218] went down[^h3381], and came[^h935] to David[^h1732] in the harvest time[^h7105] unto the cave[^h4631] of Adullam[^h5725]: and the troop[^h2416] of the Philistines[^h6430] pitched[^h2583] in the valley[^h6010] of Rephaim[^h7497]. 
###### 14
And David[^h1732] was then in an hold[^h4686], and the garrison[^h4673] of the Philistines[^h6430] was then in Bethlehem[^h1035].
###### 15
And David[^h1732] longed[^h183], and said[^h559], Oh that one would give me drink[^h8248] of the water[^h4325] of the well[^h953] of Bethlehem[^h1035], which is by the gate[^h8179]!
###### 16
And the three[^h7969] mighty men[^h1368] brake through[^h1234] the host[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430], and drew[^h7579] water[^h4325] out of the well[^h953] of Bethlehem[^h1035], that was by the gate[^h8179], and took[^h5375] it, and brought[^h935] it to David[^h1732]: nevertheless he would[^h14] not drink[^h8354] thereof, but poured it out[^h5258] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
And he said[^h559], Be it far[^h2486] from me, O LORD[^h3068], that I should do[^h6213] this: is not this the blood[^h1818] of the men[^h582] that went[^h1980] in jeopardy of their lives[^h5315]? therefore he would[^h14] not drink[^h8354] it. These things did[^h6213] these three[^h7969] mighty men[^h1368].
###### 18
And Abishai[^h52], the brother[^h251] of Joab[^h3097], the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], was chief[^h7218] among three[^h7992]. And he lifted up[^h5782] his spear[^h2595] against three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967], and slew[^h2491] them, and had the name[^h8034] among three[^h7969]. 
###### 19
Was he not most honourable[^h3513] of three[^h7969]? therefore he was their captain[^h8269]: howbeit he attained[^h935] not unto the first three[^h7969].
###### 20
And Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], the son[^h1121] of a valiant[^h2428] man[^h376] [^h381], of Kabzeel[^h6909], who had done many[^h7227] acts[^h6467], he slew[^h5221] two[^h8147] lionlike men[^h739] of Moab[^h4124]: he went down[^h3381] also and slew[^h5221] a lion[^h738] in the midst[^h8432] of a pit[^h953] in time[^h3117] of snow[^h7950]:  
###### 21
And he slew[^h2026] an Egyptian[^h4713], a goodly[^h4758] man[^h376]: and the Egyptian[^h4713] had a spear[^h2595] in his hand[^h3027]; but he went down[^h3381] to him with a staff[^h7626], and plucked[^h1497] the spear[^h2595] out of the Egyptian's[^h4713] hand[^h3027], and slew[^h5221] him with his own spear[^h2595]. 
###### 22
These things did[^h6213] Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], and had the name[^h8034] among three[^h7969] mighty men[^h1368].
###### 23
He was more honourable[^h3513] than the thirty[^h7970], but he attained[^h935] not to the first three[^h7969]. And David[^h1732] set[^h7760] him over his guard[^h4928].

###### 1
Now there was long[^h752] war[^h4421] between the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586] and the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732]: but David[^h1732] waxed[^h1980] stronger[^h2390] and stronger[^h2390], and the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586] waxed[^h1980] weaker[^h1800] and weaker[^h1800].
###### 2
And unto David[^h1732] were sons[^h1121] born[^h3205] [^h3205] in Hebron[^h2275]: and his firstborn[^h1060] was Amnon[^h550], of Ahinoam[^h293] the Jezreelitess[^h3159];
###### 3
And his second[^h4932], Chileab[^h3609], of Abigail[^h26] the wife[^h802] of Nabal[^h5037] the Carmelite[^h3761]; and the third[^h7992], Absalom[^h53] the son[^h1121] of Maacah[^h4601] the daughter[^h1323] of Talmai[^h8526] king[^h4428] of Geshur[^h1650]; 
###### 4
And the fourth[^h7243], Adonijah[^h138] the son[^h1121] of Haggith[^h2294]; and the fifth[^h2549], Shephatiah[^h8203] the son[^h1121] of Abital[^h37];
###### 5
And the sixth[^h8345], Ithream[^h3507], by Eglah[^h5698] David's[^h1732] wife[^h802]. These were born[^h3205] to David[^h1732] in Hebron[^h2275].
###### 6
And it came to pass, while there was war[^h4421] between the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586] and the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], that Abner[^h74] made himself strong[^h2388] for the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586].
###### 7
And Saul[^h7586] had a concubine[^h6370], whose name[^h8034] was Rizpah[^h7532], the daughter[^h1323] of Aiah[^h345]: and Ishbosheth said[^h559] to Abner[^h74], Wherefore hast thou gone in[^h935] unto my father's[^h1] concubine[^h6370]?
###### 8
Then was Abner[^h74] very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734] for the words[^h1697] of Ishbosheth[^h378], and said[^h559], Am I a dog's[^h3611] head[^h7218], which against Judah[^h3063] do shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] this day[^h3117] unto the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586] thy father[^h1], to his brethren[^h251], and to his friends[^h4828], and have not delivered[^h4672] thee into the hand[^h3027] of David[^h1732], that thou chargest[^h6485] me to day[^h3117] with a fault[^h5771] concerning this woman[^h802]?
###### 9
So do[^h6213] God[^h430] to Abner[^h74], and more also[^h3254], except, as the LORD[^h3068] hath sworn[^h7650] to David[^h1732], even so I do[^h6213] to him;
###### 10
To translate[^h5674] the kingdom[^h4467] from the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], and to set up[^h6965] the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732] over Israel[^h3478] and over Judah[^h3063], from Dan[^h1835] even to Beersheba[^h884].
###### 11
And he could[^h3201] not answer[^h7725] Abner[^h74] a word[^h1697] again, because he feared[^h3372] him.
###### 12
And Abner[^h74] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to David[^h1732] on his behalf, saying[^h559], Whose is the land[^h776]? saying[^h559] also, Make[^h3772] thy league[^h1285] with me, and, behold, my hand[^h3027] shall be with thee, to bring about[^h5437] all Israel[^h3478] unto thee.
###### 13
And he said[^h559], Well[^h2896]; I will make[^h3772] a league[^h1285] with thee: but one[^h259] thing[^h1697] I require[^h7592] of thee, that is[^h559], Thou shalt not see[^h7200] my face[^h6440], except thou first[^h6440] bring[^h935] Michal[^h4324] Saul's[^h7586] daughter[^h1323], when thou comest[^h935] to see[^h7200] my face[^h6440]. 
###### 14
And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to Ishbosheth[^h378] Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121], saying[^h559], Deliver[^h5414] me my wife[^h802] Michal[^h4324], which I espoused[^h781] to me for an hundred[^h3967] foreskins[^h6190] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 15
And Ishbosheth[^h378] sent[^h7971], and took[^h3947] her from her husband[^h376], even from Phaltiel[^h6409] the son[^h1121] of Laish[^h3889] [^h3919].
###### 16
And her husband[^h376] went[^h3212] with her along weeping[^h1980] [^h1058] behind[^h310] her to Bahurim[^h980]. Then said[^h559] Abner[^h74] unto him, Go[^h3212], return[^h7725]. And he returned[^h7725]. 
###### 17
And Abner[^h74] had communication[^h1961] [^h1697] with the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Ye sought[^h1245] for David[^h1732] in times[^h8543] past[^h8032] to be king[^h4428] over you: 
###### 18
Now then do[^h6213] it: for the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h559] of David[^h1732], saying[^h559], By the hand[^h3027] of my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] I will save[^h3467] my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430], and out of the hand[^h3027] of all their enemies[^h341].
###### 19
And Abner[^h74] also spake[^h1696] in the ears[^h241] of Benjamin[^h1144]: and Abner[^h74] went[^h3212] also to speak[^h1696] in the ears[^h241] of David[^h1732] in Hebron[^h2275] all that seemed[^h5869] good[^h2896] to Israel[^h3478], and that seemed good[^h5869] to the whole house[^h1004] of Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 20
So Abner[^h74] came[^h935] to David[^h1732] to Hebron[^h2275], and twenty[^h6242] men[^h582] with him. And David[^h1732] made[^h6213] Abner[^h74] and the men[^h582] that were with him a feast[^h4960].
###### 21
And Abner[^h74] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], I will arise[^h6965] and go[^h3212], and will gather[^h6908] all Israel[^h3478] unto my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], that they may make[^h3772] a league[^h1285] with thee, and that thou mayest reign[^h4427] over all that thine heart[^h5315] desireth[^h183]. And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] Abner[^h74] away[^h7971]; and he went[^h3212] in peace[^h7965].
###### 22
And, behold, the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732] and Joab[^h3097] came[^h935] from pursuing a troop[^h1416], and brought in[^h935] a great[^h7227] spoil[^h7998] with them: but Abner[^h74] was not with David[^h1732] in Hebron[^h2275]; for he had sent him away[^h7971], and he was gone[^h3212] in peace[^h7965].
###### 23
When Joab[^h3097] and all the host[^h6635] that was with him were come[^h935], they told[^h5046] Joab[^h3097], saying[^h559], Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and he hath sent him away[^h7971], and he is gone[^h3212] in peace[^h7965].
###### 24
Then Joab[^h3097] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], What hast thou done[^h6213]? behold, Abner[^h74] came[^h935] unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away[^h7971], and he is quite[^h1980] gone[^h3212]?
###### 25
Thou knowest[^h3045] Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], that he came[^h935] to deceive[^h6601] thee, and to know[^h3045] thy going out[^h4161] and thy coming in[^h4126] [^h3996], and to know[^h3045] all that thou doest[^h6213].
###### 26
And when Joab[^h3097] was come out[^h3318] from David[^h1732], he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] after[^h310] Abner[^h74], which brought him again[^h7725] from the well[^h953] of Sirah[^h5626]: but David[^h1732] knew[^h3045] it not.
###### 27
And when Abner[^h74] was returned[^h7725] to Hebron[^h2275], Joab[^h3097] took him aside[^h5186] in[^h413] [^h8432] the gate[^h8179] to speak[^h1696] with him quietly[^h7987], and smote[^h5221] him there under the fifth[^h2570] rib, that he died[^h4191], for the blood[^h1818] of Asahel[^h6214] his brother[^h251]. 
###### 28
And afterward[^h310] when David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] it, he said[^h559], I and my kingdom[^h4467] are guiltless[^h5355] before the LORD[^h3068] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769] from the blood[^h1818] of Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369]: 
###### 29
Let it rest[^h2342] on the head[^h7218] of Joab[^h3097], and on all his father's[^h1] house[^h1004]; and let there not fail[^h3772] from the house[^h1004] of Joab[^h3097] one that hath an issue[^h2100], or that is a leper[^h6879], or that leaneth[^h2388] on a staff[^h6418], or that falleth[^h5307] on the sword[^h2719], or that lacketh[^h2638] bread[^h3899]. 
###### 30
So Joab[^h3097] and Abishai[^h52] his brother[^h251] slew[^h2026] Abner[^h74], because he had slain[^h4191] their brother[^h251] Asahel[^h6214] at Gibeon[^h1391] in the battle[^h4421].
###### 31
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Joab[^h3097], and to all the people[^h5971] that were with him, Rend[^h7167] your clothes[^h899], and gird[^h2296] you with sackcloth[^h8242], and mourn[^h5594] before[^h6440] Abner[^h74]. And king[^h4428] David[^h1732] himself followed[^h1980] [^h310] the bier[^h4296]. 
###### 32
And they buried[^h6912] Abner[^h74] in Hebron[^h2275]: and the king[^h4428] lifted up[^h5375] his voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058] at the grave[^h6913] of Abner[^h74]; and all the people[^h5971] wept[^h1058].
###### 33
And the king[^h4428] lamented[^h6969] over Abner[^h74], and said[^h559], Died[^h4191] Abner[^h74] as a fool[^h5036] dieth[^h4194]?
###### 34
Thy hands[^h3027] were not bound[^h631], nor thy feet[^h7272] put[^h5066] into fetters[^h5178]: as a man falleth[^h5307] before[^h6440] wicked[^h5766] men[^h1121], so fellest[^h5307] thou. And all the people[^h5971] wept[^h1058] again[^h3254] over him. 
###### 35
And when all[^h3605] the people[^h5971] came[^h935] to cause[^h1262] David[^h1732] to eat[^h1262] meat[^h3899] while it was yet[^h5750] day[^h3117], David[^h1732] sware[^h7650], saying[^h559], So do[^h6213] God[^h430] to me, and more also[^h3254], if I taste[^h2938] bread[^h3899], or ought[^h3972] else, till[^h6440] the sun[^h8121] be down[^h935].
###### 36
And all the people[^h5971] took notice[^h5234] of it, and it pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] them: as whatsoever the king[^h4428] did[^h6213] pleased[^h5869] [^h2896] all the people[^h5971]. 
###### 37
For all the people[^h5971] and all Israel[^h3478] understood[^h3045] that day[^h3117] that it was not of the king[^h4428] to slay[^h4191] Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369].
###### 38
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Know[^h3045] ye not that there is a prince[^h8269] and a great man[^h1419] fallen[^h5307] this day[^h3117] in Israel[^h3478]?
###### 39
And I am this day[^h3117] weak[^h7390], though anointed[^h4886] king[^h4428]; and these men[^h582] the sons[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] be too hard[^h7186] for me: the LORD[^h3068] shall reward[^h7999] the doer of evil[^h6213] according to his wickedness[^h7451].

###### 1
And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Is there yet[^h3426] any that is left[^h3498] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], that I may shew[^h6213] him kindness[^h2617] for Jonathan's[^h3083] sake?
###### 2
And there was of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586] a servant[^h5650] whose name[^h8034] was Ziba[^h6717]. And when they had called[^h7121] him unto David[^h1732], the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Art thou Ziba[^h6717]? And he said[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] is he.
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Is there not[^h657] yet any[^h376] of the house[^h1004] of Saul[^h7586], that I may shew[^h6213] the kindness[^h2617] of God[^h430] unto him? And Ziba[^h6717] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Jonathan[^h3083] hath yet a son[^h1121], which is lame[^h5223] on his feet[^h7272].
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Where[^h375] is he? And Ziba[^h6717] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Behold, he is in the house[^h1004] of Machir[^h4353], the son[^h1121] of Ammiel[^h5988], in Lodebar[^h3810].
###### 5
Then king[^h4428] David[^h1732] sent[^h7971], and fetched[^h3947] him out of the house[^h1004] of Machir[^h4353], the son[^h1121] of Ammiel[^h5988], from Lodebar[^h3810].
###### 6
Now when Mephibosheth[^h4648], the son[^h1121] of Jonathan[^h3083], the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586], was come[^h935] unto David[^h1732], he fell[^h5307] on his face[^h6440], and did reverence[^h7812]. And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Mephibosheth[^h4648]. And he answered[^h559], Behold thy servant[^h5650]!
###### 7
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, Fear[^h3372] not: for I will surely[^h6213] shew[^h6213] thee kindness[^h2617] for Jonathan[^h3083] thy father's[^h1] sake, and will restore[^h7725] thee all the land[^h7704] of Saul[^h7586] thy father[^h1]; and thou shalt eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] at my table[^h7979] continually[^h8548].
###### 8
And he bowed[^h7812] himself, and said[^h559], What is thy servant[^h5650], that thou shouldest look[^h6437] upon such a dead[^h4191] dog[^h3611] as I am?
###### 9
Then the king[^h4428] called[^h7121] to Ziba[^h6717], Saul's[^h7586] servant[^h5288], and said[^h559] unto him, I have given[^h5414] unto thy master's[^h113] son[^h1121] all that pertained[^h1961] to Saul[^h7586] and to all his house[^h1004].
###### 10
Thou therefore, and thy sons[^h1121], and thy servants[^h5650], shall till[^h5647] the land[^h127] for him, and thou shalt bring[^h935] in the fruits, that thy master's[^h113] son[^h1121] may have food[^h3899] to eat[^h398]: but Mephibosheth[^h4648] thy master's[^h113] son[^h1121] shall eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] alway[^h8548] at my table[^h7979]. Now Ziba[^h6717] had fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] sons[^h1121] and twenty[^h6242] servants[^h5650].
###### 11
Then said[^h559] Ziba[^h6717] unto the king[^h4428], According to all that my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] hath commanded[^h6680] his servant[^h5650], so shall thy servant[^h5650] do[^h6213]. As for Mephibosheth[^h4648], said the king, he shall eat[^h398] at my table[^h7979], as one[^h259] of the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121].
###### 12
And Mephibosheth[^h4648] had a young[^h6996] son[^h1121], whose name[^h8034] was Micha[^h4316]. And all that dwelt[^h4186] in the house[^h1004] of Ziba[^h6717] were servants[^h5650] unto Mephibosheth[^h4648].
###### 13
So Mephibosheth[^h4648] dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389]: for he did eat[^h398] continually[^h8548] at the king's[^h4428] table[^h7979]; and was lame[^h6455] on both[^h8147] his feet[^h7272].

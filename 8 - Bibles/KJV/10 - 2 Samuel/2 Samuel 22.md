###### 1
And David[^h1732] spake[^h1696] unto the LORD[^h3068] the words[^h1697] of this song[^h7892] in the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] had delivered[^h5337] him out of the hand[^h3709] of all his enemies[^h341], and out of the hand[^h3709] of Saul[^h7586]:
###### 2
And he said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] is my rock[^h5553], and my fortress[^h4686], and my deliverer[^h6403];
###### 3
The God[^h430] of my rock[^h6697]; in him will I trust[^h2620]: he is my shield[^h4043], and the horn[^h7161] of my salvation[^h3468], my high tower[^h4869], and my refuge[^h4498], my saviour[^h3467]; thou savest[^h3467] me from violence[^h2555].
###### 4
I will call[^h7121] on the LORD[^h3068], who is worthy to be praised[^h1984]: so shall I be saved[^h3467] from mine enemies[^h341].
###### 5
When the waves[^h4867] of death[^h4194] compassed[^h661] me, the floods[^h5158] of ungodly men[^h1100] made me afraid[^h1204];  
###### 6
The sorrows[^h2256] of hell[^h7585] compassed me about[^h5437]; the snares[^h4170] of death[^h4194] prevented[^h6923] me; 
###### 7
In my distress[^h6862] I called[^h7121] upon the LORD[^h3068], and cried[^h7121] to my God[^h430]: and he did hear[^h8085] my voice[^h6963] out of his temple[^h1964], and my cry[^h7775] did enter into his ears[^h241].
###### 8
Then the earth[^h776] shook[^h1607] [^h1607] and trembled[^h7493]; the foundations[^h4146] of heaven[^h8064] moved[^h7264] and shook[^h1607], because he was wroth[^h2734].
###### 9
There went up[^h5927] a smoke[^h6227] out of his nostrils[^h639], and fire[^h784] out of his mouth[^h6310] devoured[^h398]: coals[^h1513] were kindled[^h1197] by it. 
###### 10
He bowed[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064] also, and came down[^h3381]; and darkness[^h6205] was under his feet[^h7272].
###### 11
And he rode[^h7392] upon a cherub[^h3742], and did fly[^h5774]: and he was seen[^h7200] upon the wings[^h3671] of the wind[^h7307].
###### 12
And he made[^h7896] darkness[^h2822] pavilions[^h5521] round about[^h5439] him, dark[^h2841] waters[^h4325], and thick clouds[^h5645] of the skies[^h7834]. 
###### 13
Through the brightness[^h5051] before him were coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784] kindled[^h1197].
###### 14
The LORD[^h3068] thundered[^h7481] from heaven[^h8064], and the most High[^h5945] uttered[^h5414] his voice[^h6963].
###### 15
And he sent out[^h7971] arrows[^h2671], and scattered[^h6327] them; lightning[^h1300], and discomfited[^h2000] them.
###### 16
And the channels[^h650] of the sea[^h3220] appeared[^h7200], the foundations[^h4146] of the world[^h8398] were discovered[^h1540], at the rebuking[^h1606] of the LORD[^h3068], at the blast[^h5397] of the breath[^h7307] of his nostrils[^h639].
###### 17
He sent[^h7971] from above[^h4791], he took[^h3947] me; he drew[^h4871] me out of many[^h7227] waters[^h4325]; 
###### 18
He delivered[^h5337] me from my strong[^h5794] enemy[^h341], and from them that hated[^h8130] me: for they were too strong[^h553] for me.
###### 19
They prevented[^h6923] me in the day[^h3117] of my calamity[^h343]: but the LORD[^h3068] was my stay[^h4937].
###### 20
He brought me forth[^h3318] also into a large place[^h4800]: he delivered[^h2502] me, because he delighted[^h2654] in me.
###### 21
The LORD[^h3068] rewarded[^h1580] me according to my righteousness[^h6666]: according to the cleanness[^h1252] of my hands[^h3027] hath he recompensed[^h7725] me.
###### 22
For I have kept[^h8104] the ways[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068], and have not wickedly departed[^h7561] from my God[^h430].
###### 23
For all his judgments[^h4941] were before me: and as for his statutes[^h2708], I did not depart[^h5493] from them.
###### 24
I was also upright[^h8549] before him, and have kept[^h8104] myself from mine iniquity[^h5771]. 
###### 25
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] hath recompensed[^h7725] me according to my righteousness[^h6666]; according to my cleanness[^h1252] in his eye sight[^h5048] [^h5869]. 
###### 26
With the merciful[^h2623] thou wilt shew thyself merciful[^h2616], and with the upright[^h8549] man[^h1368] thou wilt shew thyself upright[^h8552].
###### 27
With the pure[^h1305] thou wilt shew thyself pure[^h1305]; and with the froward[^h6141] thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury[^h6617]. 
###### 28
And the afflicted[^h6041] people[^h5971] thou wilt save[^h3467]: but thine eyes[^h5869] are upon the haughty[^h7311], that thou mayest bring them down[^h8213].
###### 29
For thou art my lamp[^h5216], O LORD[^h3068]: and the LORD[^h3068] will lighten[^h5050] my darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 30
For by thee I have run[^h7323] through a troop[^h1416]: by my God[^h430] have I leaped over[^h1801] a wall[^h7791]. 
###### 31
As for God[^h410], his way[^h1870] is perfect[^h8549]; the word[^h565] of the LORD[^h3068] is tried[^h6884]: he is a buckler[^h4043] to all them that trust[^h2620] in him. 
###### 32
For who is God[^h410], save[^h1107] the LORD[^h3068]? and who is a rock[^h6697], save[^h1107] our God[^h430]?
###### 33
God[^h410] is my strength[^h4581] and power[^h2428]: and he maketh[^h5425] my way[^h1870] perfect[^h8549]. 
###### 34
He maketh[^h7737] my feet[^h7272] like[^h7737] hinds'[^h355] feet: and setteth[^h5975] me upon my high places[^h1116]. 
###### 35
He teacheth[^h3925] my hands[^h3027] to war[^h4421]; so that a bow[^h7198] of steel[^h5154] is broken[^h5181] by mine arms[^h2220]. 
###### 36
Thou hast also given[^h5414] me the shield[^h4043] of thy salvation[^h3468]: and thy gentleness[^h6031] [^h6038] hath made me great[^h7235]. 
###### 37
Thou hast enlarged[^h7337] my steps[^h6806] under me; so that my feet[^h7166] did not slip[^h4571]. 
###### 38
I have pursued[^h7291] mine enemies[^h341], and destroyed[^h8045] them; and turned not again[^h7725] until I had consumed[^h3615] them.
###### 39
And I have consumed[^h3615] them, and wounded[^h4272] them, that they could not arise[^h6965]: yea, they are fallen[^h5307] under my feet[^h7272].
###### 40
For thou hast girded[^h247] me with strength[^h2428] to battle[^h4421]: them that rose up[^h6965] against me hast thou subdued[^h3766] under me. 
###### 41
Thou hast also given[^h5414] me the necks[^h6203] of mine enemies[^h341], that I might destroy[^h6789] them that hate[^h8130] me.
###### 42
They looked[^h8159], but there was none to save[^h3467]; even unto the LORD[^h3068], but he answered[^h6030] them not.
###### 43
Then did I beat[^h7833] them as small as the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776], I did stamp[^h1854] them as the mire[^h2916] of the street[^h2351], and did spread them abroad[^h7554].
###### 44
Thou also hast delivered[^h6403] me from the strivings[^h7379] of my people[^h5971], thou hast kept[^h8104] me to be head[^h7218] of the heathen[^h1471]: a people[^h5971] which I knew[^h3045] not shall serve[^h5647] me.
###### 45
Strangers[^h1121] [^h5236] shall submit[^h3584] themselves unto me: as soon as they hear[^h8085] [^h241], they shall be obedient[^h8085] unto me.  
###### 46
Strangers[^h1121] [^h5236] shall fade away[^h5034], and they shall be afraid[^h2296] out of their close places[^h4526].
###### 47
The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416]; and blessed[^h1288] be my rock[^h6697]; and exalted[^h7311] be the God[^h430] of the rock[^h6697] of my salvation[^h3468].
###### 48
It is God[^h410] that avengeth[^h5414] [^h5360] me, and that bringeth down[^h3381] the people[^h5971] under me, 
###### 49
And that bringeth me forth[^h3318] from mine enemies[^h341]: thou also hast lifted me up on high[^h7311] above them that rose up[^h6965] against me: thou hast delivered[^h5337] me from the violent[^h2555] man[^h376].
###### 50
Therefore I will give thanks[^h3034] unto thee, O LORD[^h3068], among the heathen[^h1471], and I will sing praises[^h2167] unto thy name[^h8034].
###### 51
He is the tower[^h4024] [^h1431] of salvation[^h3444] for his king[^h4428]: and sheweth[^h6213] mercy[^h2617] to his anointed[^h4899], unto David[^h1732], and to his seed[^h2233] for[^h5704] evermore[^h5769].

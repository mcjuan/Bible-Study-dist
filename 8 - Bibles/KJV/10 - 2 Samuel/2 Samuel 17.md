###### 1
Moreover Ahithophel[^h302] said[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], Let me now choose out[^h977] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] men[^h376], and I will arise[^h6965] and pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] David[^h1732] this night[^h3915]:
###### 2
And I will come[^h935] upon him while he is weary[^h3023] and weak[^h7504] handed[^h3027], and will make him afraid[^h2729]: and all the people[^h5971] that are with him shall flee[^h5127]; and I will smite[^h5221] the king[^h4428] only:
###### 3
And I will bring back[^h7725] all the people[^h5971] unto thee: the man[^h376] whom thou seekest[^h1245] is as if all returned[^h7725]: so all the people[^h5971] shall be in peace[^h7965].
###### 4
And the saying[^h1697] pleased[^h3474] Absalom[^h53] well[^h5869], and all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 5
Then said[^h559] Absalom[^h53], Call[^h7121] now Hushai[^h2365] the Archite[^h757] also, and let us hear[^h8085] likewise what he saith[^h6310]. 
###### 6
And when Hushai[^h2365] was come[^h935] to Absalom[^h53], Absalom[^h53] spake[^h559] unto him, saying[^h559], Ahithophel[^h302] hath spoken[^h1696] after this manner[^h1697]: shall we do[^h6213] after his saying[^h1697]? if not; speak[^h1696] thou. 
###### 7
And Hushai[^h2365] said[^h559] unto Absalom[^h53], The counsel[^h6098] that Ahithophel[^h302] hath given[^h3289] is not good[^h2896] at this time[^h6471]. 
###### 8
For, said[^h559] Hushai[^h2365], thou knowest[^h3045] thy father[^h1] and his men[^h582], that they be mighty men[^h1368], and they be chafed[^h4751] in their minds[^h5315], as a bear[^h1677] robbed[^h7909] of her whelps in the field[^h7704]: and thy father[^h1] is a man[^h376] of war[^h4421], and will not lodge[^h3885] with the people[^h5971]. 
###### 9
Behold, he is hid[^h2244] now in some[^h259] pit[^h6354], or in some[^h259] other place[^h4725]: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown[^h5307] at the first[^h8462], that whosoever[^h8085] heareth[^h8085] it will say[^h559], There is a slaughter[^h4046] among the people[^h5971] that follow[^h310] Absalom[^h53]. 
###### 10
And he also that is valiant[^h1121] [^h2428], whose heart[^h3820] is as the heart[^h3820] of a lion[^h738], shall utterly[^h4549] melt[^h4549]: for all Israel[^h3478] knoweth[^h3045] that thy father[^h1] is a mighty man[^h1368], and they which be with him are valiant[^h2428] men[^h1121].
###### 11
Therefore I counsel[^h3289] that all Israel[^h3478] be generally[^h622] gathered[^h622] unto thee, from Dan[^h1835] even to Beersheba[^h884], as the sand[^h2344] that is by the sea[^h3220] for multitude[^h7230]; and that thou go[^h1980] to battle[^h7128] in thine own person[^h6440]. 
###### 12
So shall we come[^h935] upon him in some[^h259] place[^h4725] where he shall be found[^h4672], and we will light[^h5168] upon him as the dew[^h2919] falleth[^h5307] on the ground[^h127]: and of him and of all the men[^h582] that are with him there shall not be left[^h3498] so much as[^h1571] one[^h259].
###### 13
Moreover, if[^h518] he be gotten[^h622] into a city[^h5892], then shall all Israel[^h3478] bring[^h5375] ropes[^h2256] to that city[^h5892], and we will draw[^h5498] it into the river[^h5158], until there be not one[^h1571] small stone[^h6872] found[^h4672] there.
###### 14
And Absalom[^h53] and all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], The counsel[^h6098] of Hushai[^h2365] the Archite[^h757] is better[^h2896] than the counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302]. For the LORD[^h3068] had appointed[^h6680] to defeat[^h6565] the good[^h2896] counsel[^h6098] of Ahithophel[^h302], to the intent[^h5668] that the LORD[^h3068] might bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon Absalom[^h53]. 
###### 15
Then said[^h559] Hushai[^h2365] unto Zadok[^h6659] and to Abiathar[^h54] the priests[^h3548], Thus and thus did Ahithophel[^h302] counsel[^h3289] Absalom[^h53] and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478]; and thus and thus have I counselled[^h3289].
###### 16
Now therefore send[^h7971] quickly[^h4120], and tell[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Lodge[^h3885] not this night[^h3915] in the plains[^h6160] [^h5679] of the wilderness[^h4057], but speedily[^h5674] pass over[^h5674]; lest the king[^h4428] be swallowed up[^h1104], and all the people[^h5971] that are with him.
###### 17
Now Jonathan[^h3083] and Ahimaaz[^h290] stayed[^h5975] by Enrogel[^h5883]; for they might[^h3201] not be seen[^h7200] to come[^h935] into the city[^h5892]: and a wench[^h8198] went[^h1980] and told[^h5046] them; and they went[^h3212] and told[^h5046] king[^h4428] David[^h1732].
###### 18
Nevertheless a lad[^h5288] saw[^h7200] them, and told[^h5046] Absalom[^h53]: but they went[^h3212] both[^h8147] of them away quickly[^h4120], and came[^h935] to a man's[^h376] house[^h1004] in Bahurim[^h980], which had a well[^h875] in his court[^h2691]; whither[^h8033] they went down[^h3381].
###### 19
And the woman[^h802] took[^h3947] and spread[^h6566] a covering[^h4539] over the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6440], and spread[^h7849] ground corn[^h7383] thereon; and the thing[^h1697] was not known[^h3045].
###### 20
And when Absalom's[^h53] servants[^h5650] came[^h935] to the woman[^h802] to the house[^h1004], they said[^h559], Where is Ahimaaz[^h290] and Jonathan[^h3083]? And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto them, They be gone over[^h5674] the brook[^h4323] of water[^h4325]. And when they had sought[^h1245] and could not find[^h4672] them, they returned[^h7725] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 21
And it came to pass, after[^h310] they were departed[^h3212], that they came up[^h5927] out of the well[^h875], and went[^h3212] and told[^h5046] king[^h4428] David[^h1732], and said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Arise[^h6965], and pass quickly[^h4120] over[^h5674] the water[^h4325]: for thus hath Ahithophel[^h302] counselled[^h3289] against you.
###### 22
Then David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and all the people[^h5971] that were with him, and they passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383]: by the morning[^h1242] light[^h216] there lacked[^h5737] not one[^h259] of them that was not gone over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383].
###### 23
And when Ahithophel[^h302] saw[^h7200] that his counsel[^h6098] was not followed[^h6213], he saddled[^h2280] his ass[^h2543], and arose[^h6965], and gat him home[^h3212] to his house[^h1004], to his city[^h5892], and put his household[^h1004] in order[^h6680], and hanged[^h2614] himself, and died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in the sepulchre[^h6913] of his father[^h1].  
###### 24
Then David[^h1732] came[^h935] to Mahanaim[^h4266]. And Absalom[^h53] passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], he and all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] with him.
###### 25
And Absalom[^h53] made[^h7760] Amasa[^h6021] captain of the host[^h6635] instead of Joab[^h3097]: which Amasa[^h6021] was a man's[^h376] son[^h1121], whose name[^h8034] was Ithra[^h3501] an Israelite[^h3481], that went in[^h935] to Abigail[^h26] the daughter[^h1323] of Nahash[^h5176], sister[^h269] to Zeruiah[^h6870] Joab's[^h3097] mother[^h517].
###### 26
So Israel[^h3478] and Absalom[^h53] pitched[^h2583] in the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 27
And it came to pass, when David[^h1732] was come[^h935] to Mahanaim[^h4266], that Shobi[^h7629] the son[^h1121] of Nahash[^h5176] of Rabbah[^h7237] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and Machir[^h4353] the son[^h1121] of Ammiel[^h5988] of Lodebar[^h3810], and Barzillai[^h1271] the Gileadite[^h1569] of Rogelim[^h7274],
###### 28
Brought[^h5066] beds[^h4904], and basons[^h5592], and earthen[^h3335] vessels[^h3627], and wheat[^h2406], and barley[^h8184], and flour[^h7058], and parched[^h7039] corn, and beans[^h6321], and lentiles[^h5742], and parched[^h7039] pulse, 
###### 29
And honey[^h1706], and butter[^h2529], and sheep[^h6629], and cheese[^h8194] of kine[^h1241], for David[^h1732], and for the people[^h5971] that were with him, to eat[^h398]: for they said[^h559], The people[^h5971] is hungry[^h7457], and weary[^h5889], and thirsty[^h6771], in the wilderness[^h4057].

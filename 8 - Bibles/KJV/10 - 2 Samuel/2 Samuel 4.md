###### 1
And when Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121] heard[^h8085] that Abner[^h74] was dead[^h4191] in Hebron[^h2275], his hands[^h3027] were feeble[^h7503], and all the Israelites[^h3478] were troubled[^h926].
###### 2
And Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121] had[^h1961] two[^h8147] men[^h582] that were captains[^h8269] of bands[^h1416]: the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Baanah[^h1196], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Rechab[^h7394], the sons[^h1121] of Rimmon[^h7417] a Beerothite[^h886], of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144]: (for Beeroth[^h881] also was reckoned[^h2803] to Benjamin[^h1144]: 
###### 3
And the Beerothites[^h886] fled[^h1272] to Gittaim[^h1664], and were sojourners[^h1481] there until this day[^h3117].)
###### 4
And Jonathan[^h3083], Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121], had a son[^h1121] that was lame[^h5223] of his feet[^h7272]. He was five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when the tidings[^h8052] came[^h935] of Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3083] out of Jezreel[^h3157], and his nurse[^h539] took him up[^h5375], and fled[^h5127]: and it came to pass, as she made haste[^h2648] to flee[^h5127], that he fell[^h5307], and became lame[^h6452]. And his name[^h8034] was Mephibosheth[^h4648]. 
###### 5
And the sons[^h1121] of Rimmon[^h7417] the Beerothite[^h886], Rechab[^h7394] and Baanah[^h1196], went[^h3212], and came[^h935] about the heat[^h2527] of the day[^h3117] to the house[^h1004] of Ishbosheth[^h378], who lay[^h7901] on a bed[^h4904] at noon[^h6672].
###### 6
And they came thither[^h935] into the midst[^h8432] of the house[^h1004], as though they would have fetched[^h3947] wheat[^h2406]; and they smote[^h5221] him under the fifth[^h2570] rib: and Rechab[^h7394] and Baanah[^h1196] his brother[^h251] escaped[^h4422].
###### 7
For when they came[^h935] into the house[^h1004], he lay[^h7901] on his bed[^h4296] in his bedchamber[^h2315] [^h4904], and they smote[^h5221] him, and slew[^h4191] him, and beheaded[^h5493] him, and took[^h3947] his head[^h7218], and gat them away[^h3212] through[^h1870] the plain[^h6160] all night[^h3915].
###### 8
And they brought[^h935] the head[^h7218] of Ishbosheth[^h378] unto David[^h1732] to Hebron[^h2275], and said[^h559] to the king[^h4428], Behold the head[^h7218] of Ishbosheth[^h378] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586] thine enemy[^h341], which sought[^h1245] thy life[^h5315]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath[^h5414] avenged[^h5360] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] this day[^h3117] of Saul[^h7586], and of his seed[^h2233].
###### 9
And David[^h1732] answered[^h6030] Rechab[^h7394] and Baanah[^h1196] his brother[^h251], the sons[^h1121] of Rimmon[^h7417] the Beerothite[^h886], and said[^h559] unto them, As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], who hath redeemed[^h6299] my soul[^h5315] out of all adversity[^h6869],
###### 10
When one told[^h5046] me, saying[^h559], Behold, Saul[^h7586] is dead[^h4191], thinking to have brought[^h5869] good tidings[^h1319], I took hold[^h270] of him, and slew[^h2026] him in Ziklag[^h6860], who thought that I would have given[^h5414] him a reward for his tidings[^h1309]:  
###### 11
How much more, when wicked[^h7563] men[^h582] have slain[^h2026] a righteous[^h6662] person[^h376] in his own house[^h1004] upon his bed[^h4904]? shall I not therefore now require[^h1245] his blood[^h1818] of your hand[^h3027], and take you away[^h1197] from the earth[^h776]?
###### 12
And David[^h1732] commanded[^h6680] his young men[^h5288], and they slew[^h2026] them, and cut off[^h7112] their hands[^h3027] and their feet[^h7272], and hanged them up[^h8518] over the pool[^h1295] in Hebron[^h2275]. But they took[^h3947] the head[^h7218] of Ishbosheth[^h378], and buried[^h6912] it in the sepulchre[^h6913] of Abner[^h74] in Hebron[^h2275].

###### 1
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] sat[^h3427] in his house[^h1004], and the LORD[^h3068] had given him rest[^h5117] round about[^h5439] from all his enemies[^h341];
###### 2
That the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], See[^h7200] now, I dwell[^h3427] in an house[^h1004] of cedar[^h730], but the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] dwelleth[^h3427] within[^h8432] curtains[^h3407].
###### 3
And Nathan[^h5416] said[^h559] to the king[^h4428], Go[^h3212], do[^h6213] all that is in thine heart[^h3824]; for the LORD[^h3068] is with thee.
###### 4
And it came to pass that night[^h3915], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto Nathan[^h5416], saying[^h559],
###### 5
Go[^h3212] and tell[^h559] my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Shalt thou build[^h1129] me an house[^h1004] for me to dwell in[^h3427]? 
###### 6
Whereas I have not dwelt[^h3427] in any house[^h1004] since the time[^h3117] that I brought up[^h5927] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of Egypt[^h4714], even to this day[^h3117], but have walked[^h1980] in a tent[^h168] and in a tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 7
In all the places wherein I have walked[^h1980] with all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] spake[^h1696] I a word[^h1697] with any[^h259] of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], whom I commanded[^h6680] to feed[^h7462] my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Why build[^h1129] ye not me an house[^h1004] of cedar[^h730]? 
###### 8
Now therefore so shalt thou say[^h559] unto my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], I took[^h3947] thee from the sheepcote[^h5116], from following[^h310] the sheep[^h6629], to be ruler[^h5057] over my people[^h5971], over Israel[^h3478]: 
###### 9
And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest[^h1980], and have cut off[^h3772] all thine enemies[^h341] out of thy sight[^h6440], and have made[^h6213] thee a great[^h1419] name[^h8034], like unto the name[^h8034] of the great[^h1419] men that are in the earth[^h776]. 
###### 10
Moreover I will appoint[^h7760] a place[^h4725] for my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and will plant[^h5193] them, that they may dwell[^h7931] in a place of their own, and move[^h7264] no more; neither shall the children[^h1121] of wickedness[^h5766] afflict[^h6031] them any more[^h3254], as beforetime[^h7223],
###### 11
And as since the time[^h3117] that I commanded[^h6680] judges[^h8199] to be over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and have caused thee to rest[^h5117] from all thine enemies[^h341]. Also the LORD[^h3068] telleth[^h5046] thee that he will make[^h6213] thee an house[^h1004].
###### 12
And when thy days[^h3117] be fulfilled[^h4390], and thou shalt sleep[^h7901] with thy fathers[^h1], I will set up[^h6965] thy seed[^h2233] after[^h310] thee, which shall proceed[^h3318] out of thy bowels[^h4578], and I will establish[^h3559] his kingdom[^h4467].
###### 13
He shall build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for my name[^h8034], and I will stablish[^h3559] the throne[^h3678] of his kingdom[^h4467] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 14
I will be his father[^h1], and he shall be my son[^h1121]. If he commit iniquity[^h5753], I will chasten[^h3198] him with the rod[^h7626] of men[^h582], and with the stripes[^h5061] of the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]:
###### 15
But my mercy[^h2617] shall not depart away[^h5493] from him, as I took[^h5493] it from Saul[^h7586], whom I put away[^h5493] before[^h6440] thee.
###### 16
And thine house[^h1004] and thy kingdom[^h4467] shall be established[^h539] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769] before[^h6440] thee: thy throne[^h3678] shall be established[^h3559] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 17
According to all these words[^h1697], and according to all this vision[^h2384], so did Nathan[^h5416] speak[^h1696] unto David[^h1732].
###### 18
Then went[^h935] king[^h4428] David[^h1732] in, and sat[^h3427] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and he said[^h559], Who am I, O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]? and what is my house[^h1004], that thou hast brought[^h935] me hitherto[^h1988]?
###### 19
And this was yet a small thing[^h6994] in thy sight[^h5869], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; but thou hast spoken[^h1696] also of thy servant's[^h5650] house[^h1004] for a great while to come[^h7350]. And is this the manner[^h8452] of man[^h120], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]? 
###### 20
And what can[^h3254] David[^h1732] say[^h1696] more[^h3254] unto thee? for thou, Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], knowest[^h3045] thy servant[^h5650].
###### 21
For thy word's[^h1697] sake, and according to thine own heart[^h3820], hast thou done[^h6213] all these great things[^h1420], to make thy servant[^h5650] know[^h3045] them.
###### 22
Wherefore thou art great[^h1431], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430]: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God[^h430] beside[^h2108] thee, according to all that we have heard[^h8085] with our ears[^h241].
###### 23
And what one[^h259] nation[^h1471] in the earth[^h776] is like thy people[^h5971], even like Israel[^h3478], whom God[^h430] went[^h1980] to redeem[^h6299] for a people[^h5971] to himself, and to make[^h7760] him a name[^h8034], and to do[^h6213] for you great things[^h1420] and terrible[^h3372], for thy land[^h776], before[^h6440] thy people[^h5971], which thou redeemedst[^h6299] to thee from Egypt[^h4714], from the nations[^h1471] and their gods[^h430]?
###### 24
For thou hast confirmed[^h3559] to thyself thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] to be a people[^h5971] unto thee for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]: and thou, LORD[^h3068], art become[^h1961] their God[^h430].
###### 25
And now, O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], the word[^h1697] that thou hast spoken[^h1696] concerning thy servant[^h5650], and concerning his house[^h1004], establish[^h6965] it for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], and do[^h6213] as thou hast said[^h1696].
###### 26
And let thy name[^h8034] be magnified[^h1431] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is the God[^h430] over Israel[^h3478]: and let the house[^h1004] of thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] be established[^h3559] before[^h6440] thee.
###### 27
For thou, O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], hast revealed[^h1540] [^h241] to thy servant[^h5650], saying[^h559], I will build[^h1129] thee an house[^h1004]: therefore hath thy servant[^h5650] found[^h4672] in his heart[^h3820] to pray[^h6419] this prayer[^h8605] unto thee. 
###### 28
And now, O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], thou art that God[^h430], and thy words[^h1697] be true[^h571], and thou hast promised[^h1696] this goodness[^h2896] unto thy servant[^h5650]:
###### 29
Therefore now let it please[^h2974] thee to bless[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of thy servant[^h5650], that it may continue for ever[^h5769] before[^h6440] thee: for thou, O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], hast spoken[^h1696] it: and with thy blessing[^h1293] let the house[^h1004] of thy servant[^h5650] be blessed[^h1288] for ever[^h5769].

###### 1
Again, David[^h1732] gathered together[^h622] [^h3254] all the chosen[^h977] men of Israel[^h3478], thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505].
###### 2
And David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] with all the people[^h5971] that were with him from Baale of Judah[^h1184], to bring up[^h5927] from thence the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], whose name[^h8034] is called[^h7121] by the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] that dwelleth[^h3427] between the cherubims[^h3742].  
###### 3
And they set[^h7392] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] upon a new[^h2319] cart[^h5699], and brought[^h5375] it out of the house[^h1004] of Abinadab[^h41] that was in Gibeah[^h1390]: and Uzzah[^h5798] and Ahio[^h283], the sons[^h1121] of Abinadab[^h41], drave[^h5090] the new[^h2319] cart[^h5699].  
###### 4
And they brought[^h5375] it out of the house[^h1004] of Abinadab[^h41] which was at Gibeah[^h1390], accompanying[^h5973] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]: and Ahio[^h283] went[^h1980] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727]. 
###### 5
And David[^h1732] and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] played[^h7832] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] on all manner of instruments made of fir[^h1265] wood[^h6086], even on harps[^h3658], and on psalteries[^h5035], and on timbrels[^h8596], and on cornets[^h4517], and on cymbals[^h6767].
###### 6
And when they came[^h935] to Nachon's[^h5225] threshingfloor[^h1637], Uzzah[^h5798] put forth[^h7971] his hand to the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], and took hold[^h270] of it; for the oxen[^h1241] shook[^h8058] it. 
###### 7
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Uzzah[^h5798]; and God[^h430] smote[^h5221] him there for his error[^h7944]; and there he died[^h4191] by the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]. 
###### 8
And David[^h1732] was displeased[^h2734], because the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h6555] a breach[^h6556] upon Uzzah[^h5798]: and he called[^h7121] the name of the place[^h4725] Perezuzzah[^h6560] to this day[^h3117].  
###### 9
And David[^h1732] was afraid[^h3372] of the LORD[^h3068] that day[^h3117], and said[^h559], How shall the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] come[^h935] to me?
###### 10
So David[^h1732] would[^h14] not remove[^h5493] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] unto him into the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: but David[^h1732] carried it aside[^h5186] into the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654] the Gittite[^h1663].
###### 11
And the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] continued[^h3427] in the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654] the Gittite[^h1663] three[^h7969] months[^h2320]: and the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] Obededom[^h5654], and all his household[^h1004].
###### 12
And it was told[^h5046] king[^h4428] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654], and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]. So David[^h1732] went[^h3212] and brought up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] from the house[^h1004] of Obededom[^h5654] into the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] with gladness[^h8057].
###### 13
And it was so, that when they that bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] had gone[^h6805] six[^h8337] paces[^h6806], he sacrificed[^h2076] oxen[^h7794] and fatlings[^h4806].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] danced[^h3769] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] with all his might[^h5797]; and David[^h1732] was girded[^h2296] with a linen[^h906] ephod[^h646].
###### 15
So David[^h1732] and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] brought up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] with shouting[^h8643], and with the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782].
###### 16
And as the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h935] into the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], Michal[^h4324] Saul's[^h7586] daughter[^h1323] looked[^h8259] through a window[^h2474], and saw[^h7200] king[^h4428] David[^h1732] leaping[^h6339] and dancing[^h3769] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and she despised[^h959] him in her heart[^h3820].
###### 17
And they brought[^h935] in the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and set[^h3322] it in his place[^h4725], in the midst[^h8432] of the tabernacle[^h168] that David[^h1732] had pitched[^h5186] for it: and David[^h1732] offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 18
And as soon as David[^h1732] had made an end[^h3615] of offering[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002], he blessed[^h1288] the people[^h5971] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 19
And he dealt[^h2505] among all the people[^h5971], even among the whole multitude[^h1995] of Israel[^h3478], as well to the women[^h802] as men[^h376], to every one[^h376] a[^h259] cake[^h2471] of bread[^h3899], and a good piece[^h829] of flesh, and a flagon[^h809] of wine. So all the people[^h5971] departed[^h3212] every one[^h376] to his house[^h1004].
###### 20
Then David[^h1732] returned[^h7725] to bless[^h1288] his household[^h1004]. And Michal[^h4324] the daughter[^h1323] of Saul[^h7586] came out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] David[^h1732], and said[^h559], How glorious[^h3513] was the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] to day[^h3117], who uncovered[^h1540] himself to day[^h3117] in the eyes[^h5869] of the handmaids[^h519] of his servants[^h5650], as one[^h259] of the vain fellows[^h7386] shamelessly[^h1540] uncovereth[^h1540] himself! 
###### 21
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Michal[^h4324], It was before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], which chose[^h977] me before thy father[^h1], and before all his house[^h1004], to appoint[^h6680] me ruler[^h5057] over the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068], over Israel[^h3478]: therefore will I play[^h7832] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
And I will yet be more vile[^h7043] than thus[^h2063], and will be base[^h8217] in mine own sight[^h5869]: and of the maidservants[^h519] which thou hast spoken[^h559] of, of them shall I be had in honour[^h3513]. 
###### 23
Therefore Michal[^h4324] the daughter[^h1323] of Saul[^h7586] had no child[^h2056] [^h3206] unto the day[^h3117] of her death[^h4194].

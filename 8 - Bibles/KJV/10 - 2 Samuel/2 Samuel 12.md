###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] Nathan[^h5416] unto David[^h1732]. And he came[^h935] unto him, and said[^h559] unto him, There were two[^h8147] men[^h582] in one[^h259] city[^h5892]; the one[^h259] rich[^h6223], and the other[^h259] poor[^h7326].
###### 2
The rich[^h6223] man had exceeding[^h3966] many[^h7235] flocks[^h6629] and herds[^h1241]:
###### 3
But the poor[^h7326] man had nothing, save one[^h259] little[^h6996] ewe lamb[^h3535], which he had bought[^h7069] and nourished up[^h2421]: and it grew up[^h1431] together[^h3162] with him, and with his children[^h1121]; it did eat[^h398] of his own meat[^h6595], and drank[^h8354] of his own cup[^h3563], and lay[^h7901] in his bosom[^h2436], and was unto him as a daughter[^h1323]. 
###### 4
And there came[^h935] a traveller[^h1982] unto the rich[^h6223] man[^h376], and he spared[^h2550] to take[^h3947] of his own flock[^h6629] and of his own herd[^h1241], to dress[^h6213] for the wayfaring man[^h732] that was come[^h935] unto him; but took[^h3947] the poor[^h7326] man's[^h376] lamb[^h3535], and dressed[^h6213] it for the man[^h376] that was come[^h935] to him.
###### 5
And David's[^h1732] anger[^h639] was greatly[^h3966] kindled[^h2734] against the man[^h376]; and he said[^h559] to Nathan[^h5416], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], the man[^h376] that hath done[^h6213] this thing shall surely[^h1121] die[^h4194]: 
###### 6
And he shall restore[^h7999] the lamb[^h3535] fourfold[^h706], because[^h6118] he did[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], and because[^h834] he had no pity[^h2550].
###### 7
And Nathan[^h5416] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Thou art the man[^h376]. Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], I anointed[^h4886] thee king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478], and I delivered[^h5337] thee out of the hand[^h3027] of Saul[^h7586];
###### 8
And I gave[^h5414] thee thy master's[^h113] house[^h1004], and thy master's[^h113] wives[^h802] into thy bosom[^h2436], and gave[^h5414] thee the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] and of Judah[^h3063]; and if that had been too little[^h4592], I would moreover have given[^h3254] unto thee such[^h2007] and such things[^h2007].
###### 9
Wherefore hast thou despised[^h959] the commandment[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], to do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in his sight[^h5869]? thou hast killed[^h5221] Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850] with the sword[^h2719], and hast taken[^h3947] his wife[^h802] to be thy wife[^h802], and hast slain[^h2026] him with the sword[^h2719] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 10
Now therefore the sword[^h2719] shall never[^h5704] [^h5769] depart[^h5493] from thine house[^h1004]; because[^h6118] thou hast despised[^h959] me, and hast taken[^h3947] the wife[^h802] of Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850] to be thy wife[^h802].
###### 11
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will raise up[^h6965] evil[^h7451] against thee out of thine own house[^h1004], and I will take[^h3947] thy wives[^h802] before thine eyes[^h5869], and give[^h5414] them unto thy neighbour[^h7453], and he shall lie[^h7901] with thy wives[^h802] in the sight[^h5869] of this sun[^h8121].
###### 12
For thou didst[^h6213] it secretly[^h5643]: but I will do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] before all Israel[^h3478], and before the sun[^h8121].
###### 13
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Nathan[^h5416], I have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068]. And Nathan[^h5416] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], The LORD[^h3068] also hath put away[^h5674] thy sin[^h2403]; thou shalt not die[^h4191].
###### 14
Howbeit[^h657], because by this deed[^h1697] thou hast given[^h5006] great occasion[^h5006] to the enemies[^h341] of the LORD[^h3068] to blaspheme[^h5006], the child[^h1121] also that is born[^h3209] unto thee shall surely[^h4191] die[^h4191].
###### 15
And Nathan[^h5416] departed[^h3212] unto his house[^h1004]. And the LORD[^h3068] struck[^h5062] the child[^h3206] that Uriah's[^h223] wife[^h802] bare[^h3205] unto David[^h1732], and it was very sick[^h605].
###### 16
David[^h1732] therefore besought[^h1245] God[^h430] for the child[^h5288]; and David[^h1732] fasted[^h6684] [^h6685], and went in[^h935], and lay[^h7901] all night[^h3885] upon the earth[^h776]. 
###### 17
And the elders[^h2205] of his house[^h1004] arose[^h6965], and went to him, to raise him up[^h6965] from the earth[^h776]: but he would[^h14] not, neither did he eat[^h1262] bread[^h3899] with them.
###### 18
And it came to pass on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], that the child[^h3206] died[^h4191]. And the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732] feared[^h3372] to tell[^h5046] him that the child[^h3206] was dead[^h4191]: for they said[^h559], Behold, while the child[^h3206] was yet alive[^h2416], we spake[^h1696] unto him, and he would not hearken[^h8085] unto our voice[^h6963]: how will he then[^h6213] vex[^h7451] himself[^h6213], if we tell[^h559] him that the child[^h3206] is dead[^h4191]? 
###### 19
But when David[^h1732] saw[^h7200] that his servants[^h5650] whispered[^h3907], David[^h1732] perceived[^h995] that the child[^h3206] was dead[^h4191]: therefore David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Is the child[^h3206] dead[^h4191]? And they said[^h559], He is dead[^h4191].
###### 20
Then David[^h1732] arose[^h6965] from the earth[^h776], and washed[^h7364], and anointed[^h5480] himself, and changed[^h2498] his apparel[^h8071], and came[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and worshipped[^h7812]: then he came[^h935] to his own house[^h1004]; and when he required[^h7592], they set[^h7760] bread[^h3899] before him, and he did eat[^h398].
###### 21
Then said[^h559] his servants[^h5650] unto him, What thing[^h1697] is this that thou hast done[^h6213]? thou didst fast[^h6684] and weep[^h1058] for the child[^h3206], while it was alive[^h2416]; but when the child[^h3206] was dead[^h4191], thou didst rise[^h6965] and eat[^h398] bread[^h3899].
###### 22
And he said[^h559], While the child[^h3206] was yet alive[^h2416], I fasted[^h6684] and wept[^h1058]: for I said[^h559], Who can tell[^h3045] whether GOD[^h3068] will be gracious[^h2603] [^h2603] to me, that the child[^h3206] may live[^h2416]?
###### 23
But now he is dead[^h4191], wherefore should I fast[^h6684]? can[^h3201] I bring him back again[^h7725]? I shall go[^h1980] to him, but he shall not return[^h7725] to me.
###### 24
And David[^h1732] comforted[^h5162] Bathsheba[^h1339] his wife[^h802], and went in[^h935] unto her, and lay[^h7901] with her: and she bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Solomon[^h8010]: and the LORD[^h3068] loved[^h157] him.
###### 25
And he sent[^h7971] by the hand[^h3027] of Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030]; and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Jedidiah[^h3041], because of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 26
And Joab[^h3097] fought[^h3898] against Rabbah[^h7237] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and took[^h3920] the royal[^h4410] city[^h5892].
###### 27
And Joab[^h3097] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to David[^h1732], and said[^h559], I have fought[^h3898] against Rabbah[^h7237], and have taken[^h3920] the city[^h5892] of waters[^h4325].
###### 28
Now therefore gather[^h622] the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] together[^h622], and encamp[^h2583] against the city[^h5892], and take[^h3920] it: lest I take[^h3920] the city[^h5892], and it be called[^h7121] after my name[^h8034]. 
###### 29
And David[^h1732] gathered[^h622] all the people[^h5971] together[^h622], and went[^h3212] to Rabbah[^h7237], and fought[^h3898] against it, and took[^h3920] it.
###### 30
And he took[^h3947] their king's[^h4428] crown[^h5850] from off his head[^h7218], the weight[^h4948] whereof was a talent[^h3603] of gold[^h2091] with the precious[^h3368] stones[^h68]: and it was set on David's[^h1732] head[^h7218]. And he brought forth[^h3318] the spoil[^h7998] of the city[^h5892] in great[^h3966] abundance[^h7235]. 
###### 31
And he brought forth[^h3318] the people[^h5971] that were therein, and put[^h7760] them under saws[^h4050], and under harrows[^h2757] of iron[^h1270], and under axes[^h4037] of iron[^h1270], and made them pass[^h5674] through the brickkiln[^h4404]: and thus did[^h6213] he unto all the cities[^h5892] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]. So David[^h1732] and all the people[^h5971] returned[^h7725] unto Jerusalem[^h3389].

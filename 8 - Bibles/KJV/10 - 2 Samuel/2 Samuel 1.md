###### 1
Now it came to pass after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Saul[^h7586], when David[^h1732] was returned[^h7725] from the slaughter[^h5221] of the Amalekites[^h6002], and David[^h1732] had abode[^h3427] two[^h8147] days[^h3117] in Ziklag[^h6860];
###### 2
It came even to pass on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], that, behold, a man[^h376] came[^h935] out of the camp[^h4264] from Saul[^h7586] with his clothes[^h899] rent[^h7167], and earth[^h127] upon his head[^h7218]: and so it was, when he came[^h935] to David[^h1732], that he fell[^h5307] to the earth[^h776], and did obeisance[^h7812].
###### 3
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, From whence comest[^h935] thou? And he said[^h559] unto him, Out of the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478] am I escaped[^h4422].
###### 4
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, How[^h4100] went the matter[^h1697]? I pray thee, tell[^h5046] me. And he answered[^h559], That the people[^h5971] are fled[^h5127] from the battle[^h4421], and many[^h7235] of the people[^h5971] also are fallen[^h5307] and dead[^h4191]; and Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121] are dead[^h4191] also. 
###### 5
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto the young man[^h5288] that told[^h5046] him, How knowest[^h3045] thou that Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121] be dead[^h4191]?
###### 6
And the young man[^h5288] that told[^h5046] him said[^h559], As I happened[^h7136] by chance[^h7122] upon mount[^h2022] Gilboa[^h1533], behold, Saul[^h7586] leaned[^h8172] upon his spear[^h2595]; and, lo, the chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h1167] [^h6571] followed hard[^h1692] after him.
###### 7
And when he looked[^h6437] behind[^h310] him, he saw[^h7200] me, and called[^h7121] unto me. And I answered[^h559], Here am I. 
###### 8
And he said[^h559] unto me, Who art thou? And I answered[^h559] him, I am an Amalekite[^h6003].
###### 9
He said[^h559] unto me again, Stand[^h5975], I pray thee, upon me, and slay[^h4191] me: for anguish[^h7661] is come[^h270] upon me, because my life[^h5315] is yet whole in me. 
###### 10
So I stood[^h5975] upon him, and slew[^h4191] him, because I was sure[^h3045] that he could not live[^h2421] after[^h310] that he was fallen[^h5307]: and I took[^h3947] the crown[^h5145] that was upon his head[^h7218], and the bracelet[^h685] that was on his arm[^h2220], and have brought[^h935] them hither unto my lord[^h113].
###### 11
Then David[^h1732] took hold[^h2388] on his clothes[^h899], and rent[^h7167] them; and likewise all the men[^h582] that were with him:
###### 12
And they mourned[^h5594], and wept[^h1058], and fasted[^h6684] until even[^h6153], for Saul[^h7586], and for Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121], and for the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; because they were fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719].
###### 13
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto the young man[^h5288] that told[^h5046] him, Whence art thou? And he answered[^h559], I am the son[^h1121] of a stranger[^h376] [^h1616], an Amalekite[^h6003].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, How wast thou not afraid[^h3372] to stretch forth[^h7971] thine hand[^h3027] to destroy[^h7843] the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899]?
###### 15
And David[^h1732] called[^h7121] one[^h259] of the young men[^h5288], and said[^h559], Go near[^h5066], and fall[^h6293] upon him. And he smote[^h5221] him that he died[^h4191].
###### 16
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, Thy blood[^h1818] be upon thy head[^h7218]; for thy mouth[^h6310] hath testified[^h6030] against thee, saying[^h559], I have slain[^h4191] the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899].
###### 17
And David[^h1732] lamented[^h6969] with this lamentation[^h7015] over Saul[^h7586] and over Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121]:
###### 18
(Also he bade[^h559] them teach[^h3925] the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] the use of the bow[^h7198]: behold, it is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of Jasher[^h3477].) 
###### 19
The beauty[^h6643] of Israel[^h3478] is slain[^h2491] upon thy high places[^h1116]: how are the mighty[^h1368] fallen[^h5307]!
###### 20
Tell[^h5046] it not in Gath[^h1661], publish[^h1319] it not in the streets[^h2351] of Askelon[^h831]; lest the daughters[^h1323] of the Philistines[^h6430] rejoice[^h8055], lest the daughters[^h1323] of the uncircumcised[^h6189] triumph[^h5937].
###### 21
Ye mountains[^h2022] of Gilboa[^h1533], let there be no dew[^h2919], neither let there be rain[^h4306], upon you, nor fields[^h7704] of offerings[^h8641]: for there the shield[^h4043] of the mighty[^h1368] is vilely cast away[^h1602], the shield[^h4043] of Saul[^h7586], as though he had not been anointed[^h4899] with oil[^h8081].
###### 22
From the blood[^h1818] of the slain[^h2491], from the fat[^h2459] of the mighty[^h1368], the bow[^h7198] of Jonathan[^h3083] turned[^h7734] not back[^h268], and the sword[^h2719] of Saul[^h7586] returned[^h7725] not empty[^h7387].
###### 23
Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3083] were lovely[^h157] and pleasant[^h5273] in their lives[^h2416], and in their death[^h4194] they were not divided[^h6504]: they were swifter[^h7043] than eagles[^h5404], they were stronger[^h1396] than lions[^h738]. 
###### 24
Ye daughters[^h1323] of Israel[^h3478], weep over[^h1058] Saul[^h7586], who clothed[^h3847] you in scarlet[^h8144], with other delights[^h5730], who put[^h5927] on ornaments[^h5716] of gold[^h2091] upon your apparel[^h3830].
###### 25
How are the mighty[^h1368] fallen[^h5307] in the midst[^h8432] of the battle[^h4421]! O Jonathan[^h3083], thou wast slain[^h2491] in thine high places[^h1116].
###### 26
I am distressed[^h6887] for thee, my brother[^h251] Jonathan[^h3083]: very[^h3966] pleasant[^h5276] hast thou been unto me: thy love[^h160] to me was wonderful[^h6381], passing the love[^h160] of women[^h802].
###### 27
How are the mighty[^h1368] fallen[^h5307], and the weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421] perished[^h6]!

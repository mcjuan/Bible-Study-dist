###### 1
And it came to pass after[^h310] this, that Absalom[^h53] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] had a fair[^h3303] sister[^h269], whose name[^h8034] was Tamar[^h8559]; and Amnon[^h550] the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732] loved[^h157] her.
###### 2
And Amnon[^h550] was so vexed[^h3334], that he fell sick[^h2470] for his sister[^h269] Tamar[^h8559]; for she was a virgin[^h1330]; and Amnon[^h550] thought[^h5869] it hard[^h6381] for him to do[^h6213] any thing[^h3972] to her. 
###### 3
But Amnon[^h550] had a friend[^h7453], whose name[^h8034] was Jonadab[^h3122], the son[^h1121] of Shimeah[^h8093] David's[^h1732] brother[^h251]: and Jonadab[^h3122] was a very[^h3966] subtil[^h2450] man[^h376].
###### 4
And he said[^h559] unto him, Why art thou, being the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121], lean[^h1800] from day[^h1242] to day[^h1242]? wilt thou not tell[^h5046] me? And Amnon[^h550] said[^h559] unto him, I love[^h157] Tamar[^h8559], my brother[^h251] Absalom's[^h53] sister[^h269].  
###### 5
And Jonadab[^h3082] said[^h559] unto him, Lay thee down[^h7901] on thy bed[^h4904], and make thyself sick[^h2470]: and when thy father[^h1] cometh[^h935] to see[^h7200] thee, say[^h559] unto him, I pray thee, let my sister[^h269] Tamar[^h8559] come[^h935], and give[^h1262] me meat[^h3899], and dress[^h6213] the meat[^h1279] in my sight[^h5869], that I may see[^h7200] it, and eat[^h398] it at her hand[^h3027].
###### 6
So Amnon[^h550] lay down[^h7901], and made himself sick[^h2470]: and when the king[^h4428] was come[^h935] to see[^h7200] him, Amnon[^h550] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], I pray thee, let Tamar[^h8559] my sister[^h269] come[^h935], and make[^h3823] me a couple[^h8147] of cakes[^h3834] in my sight[^h5869], that I may eat[^h1262] at her hand[^h3027].
###### 7
Then David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] home[^h1004] to Tamar[^h8559], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] now to thy brother[^h251] Amnon's[^h550] house[^h1004], and dress[^h6213] him meat[^h1279].
###### 8
So Tamar[^h8559] went[^h3212] to her brother[^h251] Amnon's[^h550] house[^h1004]; and he was laid down[^h7901]. And she took[^h3947] flour[^h1217], and kneaded[^h3888] it, and made cakes[^h3823] in his sight[^h5869], and did bake[^h1310] the cakes[^h3834]. 
###### 9
And she took[^h3947] a pan[^h4958], and poured them out[^h3332] before[^h6440] him; but he refused[^h3985] to eat[^h398]. And Amnon[^h550] said[^h559], Have out[^h3318] all men[^h376] from me. And they went out[^h3318] every man[^h376] from him.
###### 10
And Amnon[^h550] said[^h559] unto Tamar[^h8559], Bring[^h935] the meat[^h1279] into the chamber[^h2315], that I may eat[^h1262] of thine hand[^h3027]. And Tamar[^h8559] took[^h3947] the cakes[^h3834] which she had made[^h6213], and brought[^h935] them into the chamber[^h2315] to Amnon[^h550] her brother[^h251].
###### 11
And when she had brought[^h5066] them unto him to eat[^h398], he took hold[^h2388] of her, and said[^h559] unto her, Come[^h935] lie[^h7901] with me, my sister[^h269].
###### 12
And she answered[^h559] him, Nay, my brother[^h251], do not force[^h6031] me; for no such thing ought[^h3651] to be done[^h6213] in Israel[^h3478]: do[^h6213] not thou this folly[^h5039].  
###### 13
And I, whither shall I cause my shame[^h2781] to go[^h3212]? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one[^h259] of the fools[^h5036] in Israel[^h3478]. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak[^h1696] unto the king[^h4428]; for he will not withhold[^h4513] me from thee.
###### 14
Howbeit he would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto her voice[^h6963]: but, being stronger[^h2388] than she, forced[^h6031] her, and lay[^h7901] with her.
###### 15
Then Amnon[^h550] hated[^h8130] her exceedingly[^h3966] [^h1419]; so that the hatred[^h8135] wherewith he hated[^h8130] her was greater[^h1419] than the love[^h160] wherewith he had loved[^h157] her. And Amnon[^h550] said[^h559] unto her, Arise[^h6965], be gone[^h3212]. 
###### 16
And she said[^h559] unto him, There is no cause[^h182]: this evil[^h7451] in sending me away[^h7971] is greater[^h1419] than the other[^h312] that thou didst[^h6213] unto me. But he would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto her.
###### 17
Then he called[^h7121] his servant[^h5288] that ministered[^h8334] unto him, and said[^h559], Put[^h7971] now this woman out[^h2351] from me, and bolt[^h5274] the door[^h1817] after[^h310] her.
###### 18
And she had a garment[^h3801] of divers colours[^h6446] upon her: for with such robes[^h4598] were the king's[^h4428] daughters[^h1323] that were virgins[^h1330] apparelled[^h3847]. Then his servant[^h8334] brought[^h3318] her out[^h2351], and bolted[^h5274] the door[^h1817] after[^h310] her.
###### 19
And Tamar[^h8559] put[^h3947] ashes[^h665] on her head[^h7218], and rent[^h7167] her garment[^h3801] of divers colours[^h6446] that was on her, and laid[^h7760] her hand[^h3027] on her head[^h7218], and went[^h3212] on[^h1980] crying[^h2199].
###### 20
And Absalom[^h53] her brother[^h251] said[^h559] unto her, Hath Amnon[^h550] thy brother[^h251] been with thee? but hold now thy peace[^h2790], my sister[^h269]: he is thy brother[^h251]; regard[^h7896] [^h3820] not this thing[^h1697]. So Tamar[^h8559] remained[^h3427] desolate[^h8074] in her brother[^h251] Absalom's[^h53] house[^h1004].   
###### 21
But when king[^h4428] David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] of all these things[^h1697], he was very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734].
###### 22
And Absalom[^h53] spake[^h1696] unto his brother Amnon[^h550] neither good[^h2896] nor bad[^h7451]: for Absalom[^h53] hated[^h8130] Amnon[^h550], because[^h1697] he had forced[^h6031] his sister[^h269] Tamar[^h8559].
###### 23
And it came to pass after two full[^h3117] years[^h8141], that Absalom[^h53] had sheepshearers[^h1494] in Baalhazor[^h1178], which is beside Ephraim[^h669]: and Absalom[^h53] invited[^h7121] all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121].
###### 24
And Absalom[^h53] came[^h935] to the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], Behold now, thy servant[^h5650] hath sheepshearers[^h1494]; let[^h3212] the king[^h4428], I beseech thee, and his servants[^h5650] go[^h3212] with thy servant[^h5650].
###### 25
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to Absalom[^h53], Nay, my son[^h1121], let us not all now go[^h3212], lest we be chargeable[^h3513] unto thee. And he pressed[^h6555] him: howbeit he would[^h14] not go[^h3212], but blessed[^h1288] him.
###### 26
Then said[^h559] Absalom[^h53], If not, I pray thee, let my brother[^h251] Amnon[^h550] go[^h3212] with us. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Why should he go[^h3212] with thee?
###### 27
But Absalom[^h53] pressed[^h6555] him, that he let Amnon[^h550] and all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] go[^h7971] with him.
###### 28
Now Absalom[^h53] had commanded[^h6680] his servants[^h5288], saying[^h559], Mark[^h7200] ye now when Amnon's[^h550] heart[^h3820] is merry[^h2896] with wine[^h3196], and when I say[^h559] unto you, Smite[^h5221] Amnon[^h550]; then kill[^h4191] him, fear[^h3372] not: have not I commanded[^h6680] you? be courageous[^h2388], and be valiant[^h1121] [^h2428].  
###### 29
And the servants[^h5288] of Absalom[^h53] did[^h6213] unto Amnon[^h550] as Absalom[^h53] had commanded[^h6680]. Then all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] arose[^h6965], and every man[^h376] gat him up[^h7392] upon his mule[^h6505], and fled[^h5127]. 
###### 30
And it came to pass, while they were in the way[^h1870], that tidings[^h8052] came[^h935] to David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Absalom[^h53] hath slain[^h5221] all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121], and there is not one[^h259] of them left[^h3498].
###### 31
Then the king[^h4428] arose[^h6965], and tare[^h7167] his garments[^h899], and lay[^h7901] on the earth[^h776]; and all his servants[^h5650] stood[^h5324] by with their clothes[^h899] rent[^h7167].
###### 32
And Jonadab[^h3122], the son[^h1121] of Shimeah[^h8093] David's[^h1732] brother[^h251], answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Let not my lord[^h113] suppose[^h559] that they have slain[^h4191] all the young men[^h5288] the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121]; for Amnon[^h550] only is dead[^h4191]: for by the appointment[^h6310] of Absalom[^h53] this hath been determined[^h7760] from the day[^h3117] that he forced[^h6031] his sister[^h269] Tamar[^h8559].  
###### 33
Now therefore let not my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] take[^h7760] the thing[^h1697] to his heart[^h3820], to think[^h559] that all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] are dead[^h4191]: for Amnon[^h550] only is dead[^h4191].
###### 34
But Absalom[^h53] fled[^h1272]. And the young man[^h5288] that kept the watch[^h6822] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and, behold, there came[^h1980] much[^h7227] people[^h5971] by the way[^h1870] of the hill[^h2022] side[^h6654] behind[^h310] him.
###### 35
And Jonadab[^h3122] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], Behold, the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] come[^h935]: as thy servant[^h5650] said[^h1697], so it is. 
###### 36
And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696], that, behold, the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121] came[^h935], and lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963] and wept[^h1058]: and the king[^h4428] also and all his servants[^h5650] wept[^h1058] very[^h3966] sore[^h1065] [^h1419]. 
###### 37
But Absalom[^h53] fled[^h1272], and went[^h3212] to Talmai[^h8526], the son[^h1121] of Ammihud[^h5991] [^h5989], king[^h4428] of Geshur[^h1650]. And David mourned[^h56] for his son[^h1121] every day[^h3117]. 
###### 38
So Absalom[^h53] fled[^h1272], and went[^h3212] to Geshur[^h1650], and was there three[^h7969] years[^h8141].
###### 39
And the soul of king[^h4428] David[^h1732] longed[^h3615] to go forth[^h3318] unto Absalom[^h53]: for he was comforted[^h5162] concerning Amnon[^h550], seeing he was dead[^h4191].

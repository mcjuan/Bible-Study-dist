###### 1
Then there was a famine[^h7458] in the days[^h3117] of David[^h1732] three[^h7969] years[^h8141], year[^h8141] after[^h310] year[^h8141]; and David[^h1732] enquired[^h1245] of[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. And the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h559], It is for Saul[^h7586], and for his bloody[^h1818] house[^h1004], because he slew[^h4191] the Gibeonites[^h1393]. 
###### 2
And the king[^h4428] called[^h7121] the Gibeonites[^h1393], and said[^h559] unto them; (now the Gibeonites[^h1393] were not of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], but of the remnant[^h3499] of the Amorites[^h567]; and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] had sworn[^h7650] unto them: and Saul[^h7586] sought[^h1245] to slay[^h5221] them in his zeal[^h7065] to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063].)
###### 3
Wherefore David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto the Gibeonites[^h1393], What shall I do[^h6213] for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement[^h3722], that ye may bless[^h1288] the inheritance[^h5159] of the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 4
And the Gibeonites[^h1393] said[^h559] unto him, We will have no silver[^h3701] nor gold[^h2091] of[^h5973] Saul[^h7586], nor of his house[^h1004]; neither for us shalt thou kill[^h4191] any man[^h376] in Israel[^h3478]. And he said[^h559], What ye shall say[^h559], that will I do[^h6213] for you. 
###### 5
And they answered[^h559] the king[^h4428], The man[^h376] that consumed[^h3615] us, and that devised[^h1819] against us that we should be destroyed[^h8045] from remaining[^h3320] in any of the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478], 
###### 6
Let seven[^h7651] men[^h582] of his sons[^h1121] be delivered[^h5414] unto us, and we will hang them up[^h3363] unto the LORD[^h3068] in Gibeah[^h1390] of Saul[^h7586], whom the LORD[^h3068] did choose[^h972]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], I will give[^h5414] them. 
###### 7
But the king[^h4428] spared[^h2550] Mephibosheth[^h4648], the son[^h1121] of Jonathan[^h3083] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586], because of the LORD'S[^h3068] oath[^h7621] that was between them, between David[^h1732] and Jonathan[^h3083] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586].
###### 8
But the king[^h4428] took[^h3947] the two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] of Rizpah[^h7532] the daughter[^h1323] of Aiah[^h345], whom she bare[^h3205] unto Saul[^h7586], Armoni[^h764] and Mephibosheth[^h4648]; and the five[^h2568] sons[^h1121] of Michal[^h4324] the daughter[^h1323] of Saul[^h7586], whom she brought up[^h3205] for Adriel[^h5741] the son[^h1121] of Barzillai[^h1271] the Meholathite[^h4259]:  
###### 9
And he delivered[^h5414] them into the hands[^h3027] of the Gibeonites[^h1393], and they hanged[^h3363] them in the hill[^h2022] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and they fell[^h5307] all seven[^h7651] [^h7659] together[^h3162], and were put to death[^h4191] in the days[^h3117] of harvest[^h7105], in the first[^h7223] days, in the beginning[^h8462] of barley[^h8184] harvest[^h7105].
###### 10
And Rizpah[^h7532] the daughter[^h1323] of Aiah[^h345] took[^h3947] sackcloth[^h8242], and spread[^h5186] it for her upon the rock[^h6697], from the beginning[^h8462] of harvest[^h7105] until water[^h4325] dropped[^h5413] upon them out of heaven[^h8064], and suffered[^h5414] neither the birds[^h5775] of the air[^h8064] to rest[^h5117] on them by day[^h3119], nor the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] by night[^h3915].
###### 11
And it was told[^h5046] David[^h1732] what Rizpah[^h7532] the daughter[^h1323] of Aiah[^h345], the concubine[^h6370] of Saul[^h7586], had done[^h6213].
###### 12
And David[^h1732] went[^h3212] and took[^h3947] the bones[^h6106] of Saul[^h7586] and the bones[^h6106] of Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121] from the men[^h1167] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568], which had stolen[^h1589] them from the street[^h7339] of Bethshan[^h1052], where the Philistines[^h6430] had hanged[^h8511] [^h8518] them, when[^h3117] the Philistines[^h6430] had slain[^h5221] Saul[^h7586] in Gilboa[^h1533]:
###### 13
And he brought up[^h5927] from thence the bones[^h6106] of Saul[^h7586] and the bones[^h6106] of Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121]; and they gathered[^h622] the bones[^h6106] of them that were hanged[^h3363].
###### 14
And the bones[^h6106] of Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121] buried[^h6912] they in the country[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144] in Zelah[^h6762], in the sepulchre[^h6913] of Kish[^h7027] his father[^h1]: and they performed[^h6213] all that the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680]. And after[^h310] that God[^h430] was intreated[^h6279] for the land[^h776].
###### 15
Moreover the Philistines[^h6430] had yet war[^h4421] again with Israel[^h3478]; and David[^h1732] went down[^h3381], and his servants[^h5650] with him, and fought[^h3898] against the Philistines[^h6430]: and David[^h1732] waxed faint[^h5774].
###### 16
And Ishbibenob[^h3430], which was of the sons[^h3211] of the giant[^h7497], the weight[^h4948] of whose spear[^h7013] weighed three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] shekels of brass[^h5178] in weight[^h4948], he being girded[^h2296] with a new[^h2319] sword, thought[^h559] to have slain[^h5221] David[^h1732].  
###### 17
But Abishai[^h52] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] succoured[^h5826] him, and smote[^h5221] the Philistine[^h6430], and killed[^h4191] him. Then the men[^h582] of David[^h1732] sware[^h7650] unto him, saying[^h559], Thou shalt go[^h3318] no more out with us to battle[^h4421], that thou quench[^h3518] not the light[^h5216] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 18
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that there was again a battle[^h4421] with the Philistines[^h6430] at Gob[^h1359]: then Sibbechai[^h5444] the Hushathite[^h2843] slew[^h5221] Saph[^h5593], which was of the sons[^h3211] of the giant[^h7497].  
###### 19
And there was again a battle[^h4421] in Gob[^h1359] with the Philistines[^h6430], where Elhanan[^h445] the son[^h1121] of Jaareoregim[^h3296], a Bethlehemite[^h1022], slew[^h5221] the brother of Goliath[^h1555] the Gittite[^h1663], the staff[^h6086] of whose spear[^h2595] was like a weaver's[^h707] beam[^h4500]. 
###### 20
And there was yet a battle[^h4421] in Gath[^h1661], where was a man[^h376] of great stature[^h4067] [^h4055], that had on every hand[^h3027] six[^h8337] fingers[^h676], and on every foot[^h7272] six[^h8337] toes[^h676], four[^h702] and twenty[^h6242] in number[^h4557]; and he also was born[^h3205] to the giant[^h7497]. 
###### 21
And when he defied[^h2778] Israel[^h3478], Jonathan[^h3083] the son[^h1121] of Shimea[^h8092] the brother[^h251] of David[^h1732] slew[^h5221] him. 
###### 22
These four[^h702] were born[^h3205] to the giant[^h7497] in Gath[^h1661], and fell[^h5307] by the hand[^h3027] of David[^h1732], and by the hand[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650].

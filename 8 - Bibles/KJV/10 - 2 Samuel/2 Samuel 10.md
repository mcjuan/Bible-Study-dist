###### 1
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] died[^h4191], and Hanun[^h2586] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 2
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732], I will shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto Hanun[^h2586] the son[^h1121] of Nahash[^h5176], as his father[^h1] shewed[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto me. And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] to comfort[^h5162] him by the hand[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650] for his father[^h1]. And David's[^h1732] servants[^h5650] came[^h935] into the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 3
And the princes[^h8269] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] said[^h559] unto Hanun[^h2586] their lord[^h113], Thinkest[^h5869] thou that David[^h1732] doth honour[^h3513] thy father[^h1], that he hath sent[^h7971] comforters[^h5162] unto thee? hath not David[^h1732] rather sent[^h7971] his servants[^h5650] unto thee, to[^h5668] search[^h2713] the city[^h5892], and to spy it out[^h7270], and to overthrow[^h2015] it? 
###### 4
Wherefore Hanun[^h2586] took[^h3947] David's[^h1732] servants[^h5650], and shaved off[^h1548] the one half[^h2677] of their beards[^h2206], and cut off[^h3772] their garments[^h4063] in the middle[^h2677], even to their buttocks[^h8357], and sent them away[^h7971].
###### 5
When they told[^h5046] it unto David[^h1732], he sent[^h7971] to meet[^h7125] them, because the men[^h582] were greatly[^h3966] ashamed[^h3637]: and the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Tarry[^h3427] at Jericho[^h3405] until your beards[^h2206] be grown[^h6779], and then return[^h7725].
###### 6
And when the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] saw[^h7200] that they stank[^h887] before David[^h1732], the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] sent[^h7971] and hired[^h7936] the Syrians[^h758] of Bethrehob[^h1050], and the Syrians[^h758] of Zoba[^h6678], twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h7273], and of king[^h4428] Maacah[^h4601] a thousand[^h505] men[^h376], and of Ishtob[^h382] twelve[^h6240] [^h8147] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]. 
###### 7
And when David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] of it, he sent[^h7971] Joab[^h3097], and all the host[^h6635] of the mighty men[^h1368].
###### 8
And the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] came out[^h3318], and put the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] at the entering in[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179]: and the Syrians[^h758] of Zoba[^h6678], and of Rehob[^h7340], and Ishtob[^h382], and Maacah[^h4601], were by themselves[^h905] in the field[^h7704].
###### 9
When Joab[^h3097] saw[^h7200] that the front[^h6440] of the battle[^h4421] was against him before[^h6440] and behind[^h268], he chose[^h977] of all the choice[^h977] men of Israel[^h3478], and put them in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the Syrians[^h758]:
###### 10
And the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] he delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of Abishai[^h52] his brother[^h251], that he might put them in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 11
And he said[^h559], If the Syrians[^h758] be too strong[^h2388] for me, then thou shalt help[^h3444] me: but if the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] be too strong[^h2388] for thee, then I will come[^h1980] and help[^h3467] thee.
###### 12
Be of good courage[^h2388], and let us play the men[^h2388] for our people[^h5971], and for the cities[^h5892] of our God[^h430]: and the LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] that which seemeth[^h5869] him good[^h2896].
###### 13
And Joab[^h3097] drew nigh[^h5066], and the people[^h5971] that were with him, unto the battle[^h4421] against the Syrians[^h758]: and they fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] him.
###### 14
And when the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] saw[^h7200] that the Syrians[^h758] were fled[^h5127], then fled[^h5127] they also before[^h6440] Abishai[^h52], and entered[^h935] into the city[^h5892]. So Joab[^h3097] returned[^h7725] from the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 15
And when the Syrians[^h758] saw[^h7200] that they were smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], they gathered[^h622] themselves together[^h3162].
###### 16
And Hadarezer[^h1928] sent[^h7971], and brought out[^h3318] the Syrians[^h758] that were beyond[^h5676] the river[^h5104]: and they came[^h935] to Helam[^h2431]; and Shobach[^h7731] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of Hadarezer[^h1928] went before[^h6440] them.  
###### 17
And when it was told[^h5046] David[^h1732], he gathered[^h622] all Israel[^h3478] together[^h622], and passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and came[^h935] to Helam[^h2431]. And the Syrians[^h758] set themselves in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] David[^h1732], and fought[^h3898] with him.
###### 18
And the Syrians[^h758] fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478]; and David[^h1732] slew[^h2026] the men of seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h7393] of the Syrians[^h758], and forty[^h705] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571], and smote[^h5221] Shobach[^h7731] the captain[^h8269] of their host[^h6635], who died[^h4191] there.
###### 19
And when all the kings[^h4428] that were servants[^h5650] to Hadarezer[^h1928] saw[^h7200] that they were smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], they made peace[^h7999] with Israel[^h3478], and served[^h5647] them. So the Syrians[^h758] feared[^h3372] to help[^h3467] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] any more.

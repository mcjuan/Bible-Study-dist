###### 1
And it came to pass after this[^h310], that David[^h1732] enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Shall I go up[^h5927] into any[^h259] of the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Go up[^h5927]. And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Whither shall I go up[^h5927]? And he said[^h559], Unto Hebron[^h2275].
###### 2
So David[^h1732] went up[^h5927] thither, and his two[^h8147] wives[^h802] also, Ahinoam[^h293] the Jezreelitess[^h3159], and Abigail[^h26] Nabal's[^h5037] wife[^h802] the Carmelite[^h3761].
###### 3
And his men[^h582] that were with him did David[^h1732] bring up[^h5927], every man[^h376] with his household[^h1004]: and they dwelt[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of Hebron[^h2275].
###### 4
And the men[^h582] of Judah[^h3063] came[^h935], and there they anointed[^h4886] David[^h1732] king[^h4428] over the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063]. And they told[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], That the men[^h582] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] were they that buried[^h6912] Saul[^h7586].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto the men[^h582] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568], and said[^h559] unto them, Blessed[^h1288] be ye of the LORD[^h3068], that ye have shewed[^h6213] this kindness[^h2617] unto your lord[^h113], even unto Saul[^h7586], and have buried[^h6912] him.
###### 6
And now the LORD[^h3068] shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] and truth[^h571] unto you: and I also will requite[^h6213] you this kindness[^h2896], because ye have done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 7
Therefore now let your hands[^h3027] be strengthened[^h2388], and be ye valiant[^h1121] [^h2428]: for your master[^h113] Saul[^h7586] is dead[^h4191], and also the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] have anointed[^h4886] me king[^h4428] over them. 
###### 8
But Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], captain[^h8269] of Saul's[^h7586] host[^h6635], took[^h3947] Ishbosheth[^h378] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586], and brought him over[^h5674] to Mahanaim[^h4266];  
###### 9
And made him king[^h4427] over Gilead[^h1568], and over the Ashurites[^h805], and over Jezreel[^h3157], and over Ephraim[^h669], and over Benjamin[^h1144], and over all Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
Ishbosheth[^h378] Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121] was forty[^h705] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478], and reigned[^h4427] two[^h8147] years[^h8141]. But the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] followed[^h310] David[^h1732].
###### 11
And the time[^h4557] [^h3117] that David[^h1732] was king[^h4428] in Hebron[^h2275] over the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] was seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] and six[^h8337] months[^h2320]. 
###### 12
And Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], and the servants[^h5650] of Ishbosheth[^h378] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586], went out[^h3318] from Mahanaim[^h4266] to Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 13
And Joab[^h3097] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], and the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732], went out[^h3318], and met[^h6298] together[^h3162] by the pool[^h1295] of Gibeon[^h1391]: and they sat down[^h3427], the one on the one side of the pool[^h1295], and the other on the other side of the pool[^h1295]. 
###### 14
And Abner[^h74] said[^h559] to Joab[^h3097], Let the young men[^h5288] now arise[^h6965], and play[^h7832] before[^h6440] us. And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559], Let them arise[^h6965].
###### 15
Then there arose[^h6965] and went over[^h5674] by number[^h4557] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] of Benjamin[^h1144], which pertained to Ishbosheth[^h378] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] of the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732].
###### 16
And they caught[^h2388] every one[^h376] his fellow[^h7453] by the head[^h7218], and thrust his sword[^h2719] in his fellow's[^h7453] side[^h6654]; so they fell down[^h5307] together[^h3162]: wherefore that place[^h4725] was called[^h7121] Helkathhazzurim[^h2521], which is in Gibeon[^h1391]. 
###### 17
And there was a very[^h3966] sore[^h7186] battle[^h4421] that day[^h3117]; and Abner[^h74] was beaten[^h5062], and the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478], before[^h6440] the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732].
###### 18
And there were three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] there, Joab[^h3097], and Abishai[^h52], and Asahel[^h6214]: and Asahel[^h6214] was as light[^h7031] of foot[^h7272] as a[^h259] wild[^h7704] roe[^h6643].  
###### 19
And Asahel[^h6214] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Abner[^h74]; and in going[^h3212] he turned[^h5186] not to the right hand[^h3225] nor to the left[^h8040] from following[^h310] Abner[^h74]. 
###### 20
Then Abner[^h74] looked[^h6437] behind[^h310] him, and said[^h559], Art thou Asahel[^h6214]? And he answered[^h559], I am.
###### 21
And Abner[^h74] said[^h559] to him, Turn thee aside[^h5186] to thy right hand[^h3225] or to thy left[^h8040], and lay thee hold[^h270] on one[^h259] of the young men[^h5288], and take[^h3947] thee his armour[^h2488]. But Asahel[^h6214] would[^h14] not turn aside[^h5493] from following[^h310] of him. 
###### 22
And Abner[^h74] said[^h559] again[^h3254] to Asahel[^h6214], Turn thee aside[^h5493] from following[^h310] me: wherefore should I smite[^h5221] thee to the ground[^h776]? how then should I hold up[^h5375] my face[^h6440] to Joab[^h3097] thy brother[^h251]?
###### 23
Howbeit he refused[^h3985] to turn aside[^h5493]: wherefore Abner[^h74] with the hinder end[^h310] of the spear[^h2595] smote[^h5221] him under[^h413] the fifth[^h2570] rib, that the spear[^h2595] came out[^h3318] behind[^h310] him; and he fell down[^h5307] there, and died[^h4191] in the same place[^h8478]: and it came to pass, that as many as came[^h935] to the place[^h4725] where Asahel[^h6214] fell down[^h5307] and died[^h4191] stood still[^h5975].
###### 24
Joab[^h3097] also and Abishai[^h52] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Abner[^h74]: and the sun[^h8121] went down[^h935] when they were come[^h935] to the hill[^h1389] of Ammah[^h522], that lieth before[^h6440] Giah[^h1520] by the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057] of Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 25
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] gathered themselves together[^h6908] after[^h310] Abner[^h74], and became one[^h259] troop[^h92], and stood[^h5975] on the top[^h7218] of an hill[^h1389].
###### 26
Then Abner[^h74] called[^h7121] to Joab[^h3097], and said[^h559], Shall the sword[^h2719] devour[^h398] for ever[^h5331]? knowest[^h3045] thou not that it will be bitterness[^h4751] in the latter end[^h314]? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid[^h559] the people[^h5971] return[^h7725] from following[^h310] their brethren[^h251]?
###### 27
And Joab[^h3097] said[^h559], As God[^h430] liveth[^h2416], unless[^h3884] thou hadst spoken[^h1696], surely then in the morning[^h1242] the people[^h5971] had gone up[^h5927] every one[^h376] from following[^h310] his brother[^h251].  
###### 28
So Joab[^h3097] blew[^h8628] a trumpet[^h7782], and all the people[^h5971] stood still[^h5975], and pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Israel[^h3478] no more, neither fought[^h3898] they any more[^h3254].
###### 29
And Abner[^h74] and his men[^h582] walked[^h1980] all that night[^h3915] through the plain[^h6160], and passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and went through[^h3212] all Bithron[^h1338], and they came[^h935] to Mahanaim[^h4266].
###### 30
And Joab[^h3097] returned[^h7725] from following[^h310] Abner[^h74]: and when he had gathered[^h6908] all the people[^h5971] together[^h6908], there lacked[^h6485] of David's[^h1732] servants[^h5650] nineteen[^h8672] [^h6240] men[^h376] and Asahel[^h6214].
###### 31
But the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732] had smitten[^h5221] of Benjamin[^h1144], and of Abner's[^h74] men[^h582], so that three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] and threescore[^h8346] men[^h376] died[^h4191].
###### 32
And they took up[^h5375] Asahel[^h6214], and buried[^h6912] him in the sepulchre[^h6913] of his father[^h1], which was in Bethlehem[^h1035]. And Joab[^h3097] and his men[^h582] went[^h3212] all night[^h3915], and they came to Hebron[^h2275] at break of day[^h215].

###### 1
For all this I considered[^h5414] in my heart[^h3820] even to declare[^h952] all this, that the righteous[^h6662], and the wise[^h2450], and their works[^h5652], are in the hand[^h3027] of God[^h430]: no man[^h120] knoweth[^h3045] either[^h1571] love[^h160] or hatred[^h8135] by all that is before[^h6440] them. 
###### 2
All things come alike to all: there is one[^h259] event[^h4745] to the righteous[^h6662], and to the wicked[^h7563]; to the good[^h2896] and to the clean[^h2889], and to the unclean[^h2931]; to him that sacrificeth[^h2076], and to him that[^h834] sacrificeth[^h2076] not: as is the good[^h2896], so is the sinner[^h2398]; and he that sweareth[^h7650], as he that feareth[^h3373] an oath[^h7621].
###### 3
This is an evil[^h7451] among all things that are done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121], that there is one[^h259] event[^h4745] unto all: yea, also the heart[^h3820] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] is full[^h4390] of evil[^h7451], and madness[^h1947] is in their heart[^h3824] while they live[^h2416], and after[^h310] that they go to the dead[^h4191].
###### 4
For[^h4310] to him that is[^h3426] joined[^h2266] [^h977] to all the living[^h2416] there is hope[^h986]: for a living[^h2416] dog[^h3611] is better[^h2896] than a dead[^h4191] lion[^h738].
###### 5
For the living[^h2416] know[^h3045] that they shall die[^h4191]: but the dead[^h4191] know[^h3045] not any thing[^h3972], neither have they any more a reward[^h7939]; for the memory[^h2143] of them is forgotten[^h7911].
###### 6
Also their love[^h160], and their hatred[^h8135], and their envy[^h7068], is now[^h3528] perished[^h6]; neither have they any more a portion[^h2506] for ever[^h5769] in any thing that is done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121].
###### 7
Go thy way[^h3212], eat[^h398] thy bread[^h3899] with joy[^h8057], and drink[^h8354] thy wine[^h3196] with a merry[^h2896] heart[^h3820]; for God[^h430] now[^h3528] accepteth[^h7521] thy works[^h4639].
###### 8
Let thy garments[^h899] be always[^h6256] white[^h3836]; and let thy head[^h7218] lack[^h2637] no ointment[^h8081].
###### 9
Live[^h2416] joyfully[^h7200] with the wife[^h802] whom thou lovest[^h157] all the days[^h3117] of the life[^h2416] of thy vanity[^h1892], which he hath given[^h5414] thee under the sun[^h8121], all the days[^h3117] of thy vanity[^h1892]: for that is thy portion[^h2506] in this life[^h2416], and in thy labour[^h5999] which thou takest[^h6001] under the sun[^h8121]. 
###### 10
Whatsoever thy hand[^h3027] findeth[^h4672] to do[^h6213], do[^h6213] it with thy might[^h3581]; for there is no work[^h4639], nor device[^h2808], nor knowledge[^h1847], nor wisdom[^h2451], in the grave[^h7585], whither thou goest[^h1980].
###### 11
I returned[^h7725], and saw[^h7200] under the sun[^h8121], that the race[^h4793] is not to the swift[^h7031], nor the battle[^h4421] to the strong[^h1368], neither yet bread[^h3899] to the wise[^h2450], nor yet riches[^h6239] to men of understanding[^h995], nor yet favour[^h2580] to men of skill[^h3045]; but time[^h6256] and chance[^h6294] happeneth[^h7136] to them all.
###### 12
For man[^h120] also knoweth[^h3045] not his time[^h6256]: as the fishes[^h1709] that are taken[^h270] in an evil[^h7451] net[^h4685], and as the birds[^h6833] that are caught[^h270] in the snare[^h6341]; so[^h1992] are the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] snared[^h3369] in an evil[^h7451] time[^h6256], when it falleth[^h5307] suddenly[^h6597] upon them.
###### 13
This[^h2090] wisdom[^h2451] have I seen[^h7200] also under the sun[^h8121], and it seemed great[^h1419] unto me:
###### 14
There was a little[^h6996] city[^h5892], and few[^h4592] men[^h582] within it; and there came[^h935] a great[^h1419] king[^h4428] against it, and besieged[^h5437] it, and built[^h1129] great[^h1419] bulwarks[^h4685] against it:
###### 15
Now there was found[^h4672] in it a poor[^h4542] wise[^h2450] man[^h376], and he by his wisdom[^h2451] delivered[^h4422] the city[^h5892]; yet no man[^h120] remembered[^h2142] that same poor[^h4542] man[^h376].
###### 16
Then said[^h559] I, Wisdom[^h2451] is better[^h2896] than strength[^h1369]: nevertheless the poor man's[^h4542] wisdom[^h2451] is despised[^h959], and his words[^h1697] are not heard[^h8085].
###### 17
The words[^h1697] of wise[^h2450] men are heard[^h8085] in quiet[^h5183] more than the cry[^h2201] of him that ruleth[^h4910] among fools[^h3684].
###### 18
Wisdom[^h2451] is better[^h2896] than weapons[^h3627] of war[^h7128]: but one[^h259] sinner[^h2398] destroyeth[^h6] much[^h7235] good[^h2896].

###### 1
To every thing there is a season[^h2165], and a time[^h6256] to every purpose[^h2656] under the heaven[^h8064]:
###### 2
A time[^h6256] to be born[^h3205], and a time[^h6256] to die[^h4191]; a time[^h6256] to plant[^h5193], and a time[^h6256] to pluck up[^h6131] that which is planted[^h5193]; 
###### 3
A time[^h6256] to kill[^h2026], and a time[^h6256] to heal[^h7495]; a time[^h6256] to break down[^h6555], and a time[^h6256] to build up[^h1129];
###### 4
A time[^h6256] to weep[^h1058], and a time[^h6256] to laugh[^h7832]; a time[^h6256] to mourn[^h5594], and a time[^h6256] to dance[^h7540];
###### 5
A time[^h6256] to cast away[^h7993] stones[^h68], and a time[^h6256] to gather[^h3664] stones[^h68] together[^h3664]; a time[^h6256] to embrace[^h2263], and a time[^h6256] to refrain[^h7368] from embracing[^h2263]; 
###### 6
A time[^h6256] to get[^h1245], and a time[^h6256] to lose[^h6]; a time[^h6256] to keep[^h8104], and a time[^h6256] to cast away[^h7993]; 
###### 7
A time[^h6256] to rend[^h7167], and a time[^h6256] to sew[^h8609]; a time[^h6256] to keep silence[^h2814], and a time[^h6256] to speak[^h1696];
###### 8
A time[^h6256] to love[^h157], and a time[^h6256] to hate[^h8130]; a time[^h6256] of war[^h4421], and a time[^h6256] of peace[^h7965].
###### 9
What profit[^h3504] hath he that worketh[^h6213] in that wherein[^h834] he laboureth[^h6001]?
###### 10
I have seen[^h7200] the travail[^h6045], which God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] to the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] to be exercised[^h6031] in it.
###### 11
He hath made[^h6213] every thing beautiful[^h3303] in his time[^h6256]: also he hath set[^h5414] the world[^h5769] in their heart[^h3820], so that[^h1097] no man[^h120] can find out[^h4672] the work[^h4639] that God[^h430] maketh[^h6213] from the beginning[^h7218] to the end[^h5490].
###### 12
I know[^h3045] that there is no good[^h2896] in them, but for a man to rejoice[^h8055], and to do[^h6213] good[^h2896] in his life[^h2416].
###### 13
And also that every man[^h120] should eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and enjoy[^h7200] the good[^h2896] of all his labour[^h5999], it is the gift[^h4991] of God[^h430].
###### 14
I know[^h3045] that, whatsoever God[^h430] doeth[^h6213], it shall be for ever[^h5769]: nothing[^h369] can be put[^h3254] to it, nor any thing taken[^h1639] from it: and God[^h430] doeth[^h6213] it, that men should fear[^h3372] before[^h6440] him.
###### 15
That which hath been is now[^h3528]; and that which is to be hath already[^h3528] been; and God[^h430] requireth[^h1245] that which is past[^h7291]. 
###### 16
And moreover I saw[^h7200] under the sun[^h8121] the place[^h4725] of judgment[^h4941], that wickedness[^h7562] was there; and the place[^h4725] of righteousness[^h6664], that iniquity[^h7562] was there.
###### 17
I said[^h559] in mine heart[^h3820], God[^h430] shall judge[^h8199] the righteous[^h6662] and the wicked[^h7563]: for there is a time[^h6256] there for every purpose[^h2656] and for every work[^h4639].
###### 18
I said[^h559] in mine heart[^h3820] concerning the estate[^h1700] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120], that God[^h430] might manifest[^h1305] them, and that they might see[^h7200] that they[^h1992] themselves are beasts[^h929]. 
###### 19
For that which befalleth[^h4745] the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] befalleth[^h4745] beasts[^h929]; even one thing[^h259] befalleth[^h4745] them: as the one dieth[^h4194], so dieth[^h4194] the other[^h2088]; yea, they have all one[^h259] breath[^h7307]; so that a man[^h120] hath no preeminence[^h4195] above a beast[^h929]: for all is vanity[^h1892].
###### 20
All go[^h1980] unto one[^h259] place[^h4725]; all are of the dust[^h6083], and all turn[^h7725] to dust[^h6083] again[^h7725].
###### 21
Who knoweth[^h3045] the spirit[^h7307] of man[^h1121] [^h120] that goeth[^h5927] upward[^h4605], and the spirit[^h7307] of the beast[^h929] that goeth[^h3381] downward[^h4295] to the earth[^h776]?  
###### 22
Wherefore I perceive[^h7200] that there is nothing better[^h2896], than that a man[^h120] should rejoice[^h8055] in his own works[^h4639]; for that is his portion[^h2506]: for who shall bring[^h935] him to see[^h7200] what shall be after[^h310] him?

###### 1
The words[^h1697] of the Preacher[^h6953], the son[^h1121] of David[^h1732], king[^h4428] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 2
Vanity[^h1892] of vanities[^h1892], saith[^h559] the Preacher[^h6953], vanity[^h1892] of vanities[^h1892]; all is vanity[^h1892].
###### 3
What profit[^h3504] hath a man[^h120] of all his labour[^h5999] which he taketh[^h5998] under the sun[^h8121]?
###### 4
One generation[^h1755] passeth away[^h1980], and another generation[^h1755] cometh[^h935] [^h935]: but the earth[^h776] abideth[^h5975] for ever[^h5769].
###### 5
The sun[^h8121] also ariseth[^h2224], and the sun[^h8121] goeth down[^h935], and hasteth[^h7602] to his place[^h4725] where he arose[^h2224]. 
###### 6
The wind[^h7307] goeth[^h1980] toward the south[^h1864], and turneth about[^h5437] unto the north[^h6828]; it whirleth about continually[^h1980], and the wind[^h7307] returneth again[^h7725] according to his circuits[^h5439].
###### 7
All the rivers[^h5158] run[^h1980] into the sea[^h3220]; yet the sea[^h3220] is not full[^h4392]; unto the place[^h4725] from whence the rivers[^h5158] come[^h1980], thither they return[^h7725] again[^h3212]. 
###### 8
All things[^h1697] are full of labour[^h3023]; man[^h376] cannot[^h3201] utter[^h1696] it: the eye[^h5869] is not satisfied[^h7646] with seeing[^h7200], nor the ear[^h241] filled[^h4390] with hearing[^h8085].
###### 9
The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done[^h6213] is that which shall be done[^h6213]: and there is no new[^h2319] thing under the sun[^h8121].
###### 10
Is there[^h3426] any thing[^h1697] whereof it may be said[^h559], See[^h7200], this is new[^h2319]? it hath been already[^h3528] of old time[^h5769], which was before[^h6440] us.
###### 11
There is no remembrance[^h2146] of former[^h7223] things; neither shall there be any remembrance[^h2146] of things that are to come[^h314] with those that shall come after[^h314].
###### 12
I the Preacher[^h6953] was king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478] in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 13
And I gave[^h5414] my heart[^h3820] to seek[^h1875] and search out[^h8446] by wisdom[^h2451] concerning all things that are done[^h6213] under heaven[^h8064]: this sore[^h7451] travail[^h6045] hath God[^h430] given[^h5414] to the sons[^h1121] of man[^h120] to be exercised[^h6031] therewith. 
###### 14
I have seen[^h7200] all the works[^h4639] that are done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121]; and, behold, all is vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307].
###### 15
That which is crooked[^h5791] cannot[^h3201] be made straight[^h8626]: and that which is wanting[^h2642] cannot[^h3201] be numbered[^h4487]. 
###### 16
I communed[^h1696] with mine own heart[^h3820], saying[^h559], Lo, I am come to great estate[^h1431], and have gotten[^h3254] more wisdom[^h2451] than all they that have been before[^h6440] me in Jerusalem[^h3389]: yea, my heart[^h3820] had great[^h7235] experience[^h7200] of wisdom[^h2451] and knowledge[^h1847]. 
###### 17
And I gave[^h5414] my heart[^h3820] to know[^h3045] wisdom[^h2451], and to know[^h3045] madness[^h1947] and folly[^h5531]: I perceived[^h3045] that this[^h1571] also is vexation[^h7475] of spirit[^h7307].
###### 18
For in much[^h7230] wisdom[^h2451] is much[^h7230] grief[^h3708]: and he that increaseth[^h3254] knowledge[^h1847] increaseth[^h3254] sorrow[^h4341].

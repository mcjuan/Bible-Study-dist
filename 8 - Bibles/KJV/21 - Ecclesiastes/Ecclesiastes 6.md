###### 1
There is[^h3426] an evil[^h7451] which I have seen[^h7200] under the sun[^h8121], and it is common[^h7227] among men[^h120]:
###### 2
A man[^h376] to whom God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] riches[^h6239], wealth[^h5233], and honour[^h3519], so that he wanteth[^h2638] nothing for his soul[^h5315] of all that he desireth[^h183], yet God[^h430] giveth him not power[^h7980] to eat[^h398] thereof, but a stranger[^h376] [^h5237] eateth[^h398] it: this is vanity[^h1892], and it is an evil[^h7451] disease[^h2483].
###### 3
If a man[^h376] beget[^h3205] an hundred[^h3967] children, and live[^h2421] many[^h7227] years[^h8141], so that the days[^h3117] of his years[^h8141] be many[^h7227], and his soul[^h5315] be not filled[^h7646] with good[^h2896], and also that he have no burial[^h6900]; I say[^h559], that an untimely birth[^h5309] is better[^h2896] than he.
###### 4
For he cometh[^h935] in with vanity[^h1892], and departeth[^h3212] in darkness[^h2822], and his name[^h8034] shall be covered[^h3680] with darkness[^h2822].
###### 5
Moreover he hath not seen[^h7200] the sun[^h8121], nor known[^h3045] any thing: this[^h2088] hath more rest[^h5183] than[^h2088] the other.
###### 6
Yea, though[^h432] he live[^h2421] a thousand[^h505] years[^h8141] twice[^h6471] told, yet hath he seen[^h7200] no good[^h2896]: do not all go[^h1980] to one[^h259] place[^h4725]?
###### 7
All the labour[^h5999] of man[^h120] is for his mouth[^h6310], and yet the appetite[^h5315] is not filled[^h4390]. 
###### 8
For what hath the wise[^h2450] more[^h3148] than the fool[^h3684]? what hath the poor[^h6041], that knoweth[^h3045] to walk[^h1980] before the living[^h2416]?
###### 9
Better[^h2896] is the sight[^h4758] of the eyes[^h5869] than the wandering[^h1980] of the desire[^h5315]: this is also vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307]. 
###### 10
That which hath been is named[^h7121] [^h8034] already[^h3528], and it is known[^h3045] that it is man[^h120]: neither may[^h3201] he contend[^h1777] with him that is mightier[^h8623] than he.
###### 11
Seeing there be[^h3426] many[^h7235] things[^h1697] that increase[^h7235] vanity[^h1892], what is man[^h120] the better[^h3148]?
###### 12
For who knoweth[^h3045] what is good[^h2896] for man[^h120] in this life[^h2416], all[^h4557] the days[^h3117] of his vain[^h1892] life[^h2416] which he spendeth[^h6213] as a shadow[^h6738]? for who can tell[^h5046] a man[^h120] what shall be after[^h310] him under the sun[^h8121]?

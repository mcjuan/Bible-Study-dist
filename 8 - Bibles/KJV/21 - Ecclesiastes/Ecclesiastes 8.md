###### 1
Who is as the wise[^h2450] man? and who knoweth[^h3045] the interpretation[^h6592] of a thing[^h1697]? a man's[^h120] wisdom[^h2451] maketh his face[^h6440] to shine[^h215], and the boldness[^h5797] of his face[^h6440] shall be changed[^h8132]. 
###### 2
I counsel thee to keep[^h8104] the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h6310], and that in regard[^h1700] of the oath[^h7621] of God[^h430].
###### 3
Be not hasty[^h926] to go out[^h3212] of his sight[^h6440]: stand[^h5975] not in an evil[^h7451] thing[^h1697]; for he doeth[^h6213] whatsoever pleaseth[^h2654] him.
###### 4
Where the word[^h1697] of a king[^h4428] is, there is power[^h7983]: and who may say[^h559] unto him, What doest[^h6213] thou?
###### 5
Whoso keepeth[^h8104] the commandment[^h4687] shall feel[^h3045] no evil[^h7451] thing[^h1697]: and a wise man's[^h2450] heart[^h3820] discerneth[^h3045] both time[^h6256] and judgment[^h4941]. 
###### 6
Because to every purpose[^h2656] there is[^h3426] time[^h6256] and judgment[^h4941], therefore the misery[^h7451] of man[^h120] is great[^h7227] upon him.
###### 7
For he knoweth[^h3045] not that which shall be: for who can tell[^h5046] him when it shall be? 
###### 8
There is no man[^h120] that hath power[^h7989] over the spirit[^h7307] to retain[^h3607] the spirit[^h7307]; neither hath he power[^h7983] in the day[^h3117] of death[^h4194]: and there is no discharge[^h4917] in that war[^h4421]; neither shall wickedness[^h7562] deliver[^h4422] those that are given[^h1167] to it. 
###### 9
All this have I seen[^h7200], and applied[^h5414] my heart[^h3820] unto every work[^h4639] that is done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121]: there is a time[^h6256] wherein one man[^h120] ruleth[^h7980] over another to his own hurt[^h7451].
###### 10
And so[^h3651] I saw[^h7200] the wicked[^h7563] buried[^h6912], who had come[^h935] and gone[^h1980] from the place[^h4725] of the holy[^h6918], and they were forgotten[^h7911] in the city[^h5892] where they had so done[^h6213]: this is also vanity[^h1892].
###### 11
Because sentence[^h6599] against an evil[^h7451] work[^h4639] is not executed[^h6213] speedily[^h4120], therefore the heart[^h3820] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] is fully set[^h4390] in them to do[^h6213] evil[^h7451].
###### 12
Though a sinner[^h2398] do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] an hundred times[^h3967], and his days be prolonged[^h748], yet surely I know[^h3045] that it shall be well[^h2896] with them that fear[^h3373] God[^h430], which fear[^h3372] before[^h6440] him:
###### 13
But it shall not be well[^h2896] with the wicked[^h7563], neither shall he prolong[^h748] his days[^h3117], which are as a shadow[^h6738]; because he feareth[^h3373] not before[^h6440] God[^h430].
###### 14
There is[^h3426] a vanity[^h1892] which is done[^h6213] upon the earth[^h776]; that there be just[^h6662] men, unto whom it happeneth[^h5060] according to the work[^h4639] of the wicked[^h7563]; again, there be[^h3426] wicked[^h7563] men, to whom it happeneth[^h5060] according to the work[^h4639] of the righteous[^h6662]: I said[^h559] that this also[^h1571] is vanity[^h1892].
###### 15
Then I commended[^h7623] mirth[^h8057], because a man[^h120] hath no better thing[^h2896] under the sun[^h8121], than to eat[^h398], and to drink[^h8354], and to be merry[^h8055]: for that shall abide[^h3867] with him of his labour[^h5999] the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416], which God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] him under the sun[^h8121].
###### 16
When I applied[^h5414] mine heart[^h3820] to know[^h3045] wisdom[^h2451], and to see[^h7200] the business[^h6045] that is done[^h6213] upon the earth[^h776]: (for also there is that neither day[^h3117] nor night[^h3915] seeth[^h7200] sleep[^h8142] with his eyes[^h5869]:)
###### 17
Then I beheld[^h7200] all the work[^h4639] of God[^h430], that a man[^h120] cannot[^h3201] find out[^h4672] the work[^h4639] that is done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121]: because[^h834] though[^h7945] a man[^h120] labour[^h5998] to seek it out[^h1245], yet he shall not find[^h4672] it; yea further; though a wise[^h2450] man think[^h559] to know[^h3045] it, yet shall he not be able[^h3201] to find[^h4672] it.

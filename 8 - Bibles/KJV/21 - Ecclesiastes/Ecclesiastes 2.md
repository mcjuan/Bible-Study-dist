###### 1
I said[^h559] in mine heart[^h3820], Go to now[^h3212], I will prove[^h5254] thee with mirth[^h8057], therefore enjoy[^h7200] pleasure[^h2896]: and, behold, this also is vanity[^h1892].
###### 2
I said[^h559] of laughter[^h7814], It is mad[^h1984]: and of mirth[^h8057], What[^h2090] doeth[^h6213] it?
###### 3
I sought[^h8446] in mine heart[^h3820] to give[^h4900] myself[^h1320] unto wine[^h3196], yet acquainting[^h5090] mine heart[^h3820] with wisdom[^h2451]; and to lay hold[^h270] on folly[^h5531], till I might see[^h7200] what was that good[^h2896] for the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120], which they should do[^h6213] under the heaven[^h8064] all[^h4557] the days[^h3117] of their life[^h2416].  
###### 4
I made me great[^h1431] works[^h4639]; I builded[^h1129] me houses[^h1004]; I planted[^h5193] me vineyards[^h3754]:
###### 5
I made[^h6213] me gardens[^h1593] and orchards[^h6508], and I planted[^h5193] trees[^h6086] in them of all kind of fruits[^h6529]:
###### 6
I made[^h6213] me pools[^h1295] of water[^h4325], to water[^h8248] therewith the wood[^h3293] that bringeth forth[^h6779] trees[^h6086]:
###### 7
I got[^h7069] me servants[^h5650] and maidens[^h8198], and had servants born[^h1121] in my house[^h1004]; also I had great[^h7235] possessions[^h4735] of great[^h1241] and small cattle[^h6629] above all that were in Jerusalem[^h3389] before[^h6440] me: 
###### 8
I gathered[^h3664] me also silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], and the peculiar treasure[^h5459] of kings[^h4428] and of the provinces[^h4082]: I gat[^h6213] me men singers[^h7891] and women singers[^h7891], and the delights[^h8588] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120], as musical instruments[^h7705] [^h7705], and that of all sorts. 
###### 9
So I was great[^h1431], and increased[^h3254] more than all that were before[^h6440] me in Jerusalem[^h3389]: also my wisdom[^h2451] remained[^h5975] with me.
###### 10
And whatsoever mine eyes[^h5869] desired[^h7592] I kept[^h680] not from them, I withheld[^h4513] not my heart[^h3820] from any joy[^h8057]; for my heart[^h3820] rejoiced[^h8056] in all my labour[^h5999]: and this was my portion[^h2506] of all my labour[^h5999].
###### 11
Then I looked[^h6437] on all the works[^h4639] that my hands[^h3027] had wrought[^h6213], and on the labour[^h5999] that I had laboured[^h5998] to do[^h6213]: and, behold, all was vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307], and there was no profit[^h3504] under the sun[^h8121].
###### 12
And I turned[^h6437] myself to behold[^h7200] wisdom[^h2451], and madness[^h1947], and folly[^h5531]: for what can the man[^h120] do that cometh[^h935] after[^h310] the king[^h4428]? even that which hath been already[^h3528] done[^h6213]. 
###### 13
Then I saw[^h7200] that[^h3426] wisdom[^h2451] excelleth[^h3504] folly[^h5531], as far as light[^h216] excelleth[^h3504] darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 14
The wise man's[^h2450] eyes[^h5869] are in his head[^h7218]; but the fool[^h3684] walketh[^h1980] in darkness[^h2822]: and I myself perceived[^h3045] also that one[^h259] event[^h4745] happeneth[^h7136] to them all.
###### 15
Then[^h227] said[^h559] I in my heart[^h3820], As it happeneth[^h4745] to the fool[^h3684], so it happeneth[^h7136] even to me[^h1571]; and why was I then more[^h3148] wise[^h2449]? Then I said[^h1696] in my heart[^h3820], that this also is vanity[^h1892]. 
###### 16
For there is no remembrance[^h2146] of the wise[^h2450] more than[^h5973] of the fool[^h3684] for ever[^h5769]; seeing that which now[^h3528] is in the days[^h3117] to come[^h935] shall all be forgotten[^h7911]. And how dieth[^h4191] the wise[^h2450] man? as the fool[^h3684].
###### 17
Therefore I hated[^h8130] life[^h2416]; because the work[^h4639] that is wrought[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121] is grievous[^h7451] unto me: for all is vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307].
###### 18
Yea, I hated[^h8130] all my labour[^h5999] which I had taken[^h6001] under the sun[^h8121]: because I should leave[^h3240] it unto the man[^h120] that shall be after[^h310] me. 
###### 19
And who knoweth[^h3045] whether he shall be a wise[^h2450] man or a fool[^h5530]? yet shall he have rule[^h7980] over all my labour[^h5999] wherein I have laboured[^h5998], and wherein I have shewed myself wise[^h2449] under the sun[^h8121]. This is also vanity[^h1892].
###### 20
Therefore I went about[^h5437] to cause[^h2976] my heart[^h3820] to despair[^h2976] of all the labour[^h5999] which I took[^h5998] under the sun[^h8121].
###### 21
For there is[^h3426] a man[^h120] whose labour[^h5999] is in wisdom[^h2451], and in knowledge[^h1847], and in equity[^h3788]; yet to a man[^h120] that hath not laboured[^h5998] therein shall he leave[^h5414] it for his portion[^h2506]. This also is vanity[^h1892] and a great[^h7227] evil[^h7451]. 
###### 22
For what hath[^h1933] man[^h120] of all his labour[^h5999], and of the vexation[^h7475] of his heart[^h3820], wherein[^h1931] he hath laboured[^h6001] under the sun[^h8121]?
###### 23
For all his days[^h3117] are sorrows[^h4341], and his travail[^h6045] grief[^h3708]; yea, his heart[^h3820] taketh not rest[^h7901] in the night[^h3915]. This is also vanity[^h1892].
###### 24
There is nothing better[^h2896] for a man[^h120], than that he should eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and that he should make his soul[^h5315] enjoy[^h7200] good[^h2896] in his labour[^h5999]. This[^h2090] also I saw[^h7200], that it was from the hand[^h3027] of God[^h430]. 
###### 25
For who can eat[^h398], or who else can hasten[^h2363] hereunto, more[^h2351] than I?
###### 26
For God giveth[^h5414] to a man[^h120] that is good[^h2896] in his sight[^h6440] wisdom[^h2451], and knowledge[^h1847], and joy[^h8057]: but to the sinner[^h2398] he giveth[^h5414] travail[^h6045], to gather[^h622] and to heap up[^h3664], that he may give[^h5414] to him that is good[^h2896] before[^h6440] God[^h430]. This also is vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307].

###### 1
Keep[^h8104] thy foot[^h7272] when thou goest[^h3212] to the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and be more ready[^h7138] to hear[^h8085], than to give[^h5414] the sacrifice[^h2077] of fools[^h3684]: for they consider[^h3045] not that they do[^h6213] evil[^h7451].
###### 2
Be not rash[^h926] with thy mouth[^h6310], and let not thine heart[^h3820] be hasty[^h4116] to utter[^h3318] any thing[^h1697] before[^h6440] God[^h430]: for God[^h430] is in heaven[^h8064], and thou upon earth[^h776]: therefore let thy words[^h1697] be few[^h4592]. 
###### 3
For a dream[^h2472] cometh[^h935] through the multitude[^h7230] of business[^h6045]; and a fool's[^h3684] voice[^h6963] is known by multitude[^h7230] of words[^h1697].
###### 4
When thou vowest[^h5087] a vow[^h5088] unto God[^h430], defer[^h309] not to pay[^h7999] it; for he hath no pleasure[^h2656] in fools[^h3684]: pay[^h7999] that which thou hast vowed[^h5087].
###### 5
Better[^h2896] is it that thou shouldest not vow[^h5087], than that thou shouldest vow[^h5087] and not pay[^h7999].
###### 6
Suffer[^h5414] not thy mouth[^h6310] to cause thy flesh[^h1320] to sin[^h2398]; neither say[^h559] thou before[^h6440] the angel[^h4397], that it was an error[^h7684]: wherefore should God[^h430] be angry[^h7107] at thy voice[^h6963], and destroy[^h2254] the work[^h4639] of thine hands[^h3027]?
###### 7
For in the multitude[^h7230] of dreams[^h2472] and many[^h7235] words[^h1697] there are also divers vanities[^h1892]: but fear[^h3372] thou God[^h430].
###### 8
If thou seest[^h7200] the oppression[^h6233] of the poor[^h7326], and violent[^h1499] perverting of judgment[^h4941] and justice[^h6664] in a province[^h4082], marvel[^h8539] not at the matter[^h2656]: for he that is higher[^h1364] than the highest[^h1364] regardeth[^h8104]; and there be higher[^h1364] than they[^h5921]. 
###### 9
Moreover the profit[^h3504] of the earth[^h776] is for all: the king[^h4428] himself is served[^h5647] by the field[^h7704].
###### 10
He that loveth[^h157] silver[^h3701] shall not be satisfied[^h7646] with silver[^h3701]; nor he that loveth[^h157] abundance[^h1995] with increase[^h8393]: this is also vanity[^h1892].
###### 11
When goods[^h2896] increase[^h7235], they are increased[^h7231] that eat[^h398] them: and what good[^h3788] is there to the owners[^h1167] thereof, saving[^h518] the beholding[^h7207] [^h7212] of them with their eyes[^h5869]?
###### 12
The sleep[^h8142] of a labouring man[^h5647] is sweet[^h4966], whether he eat[^h398] little[^h4592] or much[^h7235]: but the abundance[^h7647] of the rich[^h6223] will not suffer[^h3240] him to sleep[^h3462].
###### 13
There is[^h3426] a sore[^h2470] evil[^h7451] which I have seen[^h7200] under the sun[^h8121], namely, riches[^h6239] kept[^h8104] for the owners[^h1167] thereof to their hurt[^h7451].
###### 14
But those riches[^h6239] perish[^h6] by evil[^h7451] travail[^h6045]: and he begetteth[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and there is nothing[^h3972] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 15
As he came forth[^h3318] of his mother's[^h517] womb[^h990], naked[^h6174] shall he return[^h7725] to go[^h3212] as he came[^h935], and shall take[^h5375] nothing[^h3972] of his labour[^h5999], which he may carry away[^h3212] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 16
And this[^h2090] also is a sore[^h2470] evil[^h7451], that in all points[^h5980] as he came[^h935], so shall he go[^h3212]: and what profit[^h3504] hath he that hath laboured[^h5998] for the wind[^h7307]?
###### 17
All his days[^h3117] also he eateth[^h398] in darkness[^h2822], and he hath much[^h7235] sorrow[^h3707] and wrath[^h7110] with his sickness[^h2483].
###### 18
Behold that which I have seen[^h7200]: it is good[^h2896] and comely[^h3303] for one to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354], and to enjoy[^h7200] the good[^h2896] of all his labour[^h5999] that he taketh[^h5998] under the sun[^h8121] all[^h4557] the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416], which God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] him: for it is his portion[^h2506].  
###### 19
Every man[^h120] also to whom God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] riches[^h6239] and wealth[^h5233], and hath given him power[^h7980] to eat[^h398] thereof, and to take[^h5375] his portion[^h2506], and to rejoice[^h8055] in his labour[^h5999]; this[^h2090] is the gift[^h4991] of God[^h430].
###### 20
For he shall not much[^h7235] remember[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416]; because God[^h430] answereth[^h6031] him in the joy[^h8057] of his heart[^h3820].

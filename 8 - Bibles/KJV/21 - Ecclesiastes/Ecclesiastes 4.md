###### 1
So I returned[^h7725], and considered[^h7200] all the oppressions[^h6217] that are done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121]: and behold the tears[^h1832] of such as were oppressed[^h6231], and they had no comforter[^h5162]; and on the side[^h3027] of their oppressors[^h6231] there was power[^h3581]; but they had no comforter[^h5162]. 
###### 2
Wherefore I praised[^h7623] the dead[^h4191] which are already[^h3528] dead[^h4191] more than the living[^h2416] which are yet[^h5728] alive[^h2416].
###### 3
Yea, better[^h2896] is he than both[^h8147] they, which hath not yet[^h5728] been, who hath not seen[^h7200] the evil[^h7451] work[^h4639] that is done[^h6213] under the sun[^h8121].
###### 4
Again, I considered[^h7200] all travail[^h5999], and every right[^h3788] work[^h4639], that for this a man[^h376] is envied[^h7068] of his neighbour[^h7453]. This is also vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307].  
###### 5
The fool[^h3684] foldeth[^h2263] his hands[^h3027] together[^h2263], and eateth[^h398] his own flesh[^h1320].
###### 6
Better[^h2896] is an handful[^h3709] with quietness[^h5183], than both the hands[^h2651] full[^h4393] with travail[^h5999] and vexation[^h7469] of spirit[^h7307].
###### 7
Then I returned[^h7725], and I saw[^h7200] vanity[^h1892] under the sun[^h8121].
###### 8
There is[^h3426] one[^h259] alone, and there is not a second[^h8145]; yea, he hath neither child[^h1121] nor brother[^h251]: yet is there no end[^h7093] of all his labour[^h5999]; neither is his eye[^h5869] satisfied[^h7646] with riches[^h6239]; neither saith he, For whom do I labour[^h6001], and bereave[^h2637] my soul[^h5315] of good[^h2896]? This is also vanity[^h1892], yea, it is a sore[^h7451] travail[^h6045].
###### 9
Two[^h8147] are better[^h2896] than one[^h259]; because they have[^h3426] a good[^h2896] reward[^h7939] for their labour[^h5999].
###### 10
For if they fall[^h5307], the one[^h259] will lift up[^h6965] his fellow[^h2270]: but woe[^h337] to him that is alone[^h259] when he falleth[^h5307]; for he hath not another[^h8145] to help him up[^h6965].
###### 11
Again[^h1571], if two[^h8147] lie together[^h7901], then they have heat[^h2552]: but how can one[^h259] be warm[^h3179] alone?
###### 12
And if one[^h259] prevail[^h8630] against him, two[^h8147] shall withstand[^h5975] him; and a threefold[^h8027] cord[^h2339] is not quickly[^h4120] broken[^h5423].
###### 13
Better[^h2896] is a poor[^h4542] and a wise[^h2450] child[^h3206] than an old[^h2205] and foolish[^h3684] king[^h4428], who will[^h3045] no more be admonished[^h2094]. 
###### 14
For out of prison[^h631] [^h1004] he cometh[^h3318] to reign[^h4427]; whereas also he that is born[^h3205] in his kingdom[^h4438] becometh poor[^h7326].
###### 15
I considered[^h7200] all the living[^h2416] which walk[^h1980] under the sun[^h8121], with the second[^h8145] child[^h3206] that shall stand up[^h5975] in his stead.
###### 16
There is no end[^h7093] of all the people[^h5971], even of all that have been before[^h6440] them: they also that come after[^h314] shall not rejoice[^h8055] in him. Surely this also is vanity[^h1892] and vexation[^h7475] of spirit[^h7307].

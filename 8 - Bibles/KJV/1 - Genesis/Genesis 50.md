###### 1
And Joseph[^h3130] fell[^h5307] upon his father's[^h1] face[^h6440], and wept[^h1058] upon him, and kissed[^h5401] him.
###### 2
And Joseph[^h3130] commanded[^h6680] his servants[^h5650] the physicians[^h7495] to embalm[^h2590] his father[^h1]: and the physicians[^h7495] embalmed[^h2590] Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
And forty[^h705] days[^h3117] were fulfilled[^h4390] for him; for so are fulfilled[^h4390] the days[^h3117] of those which are embalmed[^h2590]: and the Egyptians[^h4714] mourned[^h1058] for him threescore and ten[^h7657] days[^h3117]. 
###### 4
And when the days[^h3117] of his mourning[^h1068] were past[^h5674], Joseph[^h3130] spake[^h1696] unto the house[^h1004] of Pharaoh[^h6547], saying[^h559], If now I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in your eyes[^h5869], speak[^h1696], I pray you, in the ears[^h241] of Pharaoh[^h6547], saying[^h559],
###### 5
My father[^h1] made me swear[^h7650], saying[^h559], Lo[^h2009], I die[^h4191]: in my grave[^h6913] which I have digged[^h3738] for me in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], there shalt thou bury me[^h6912]. Now therefore let me go up[^h5927], I pray thee, and bury[^h6912] my father[^h1], and I will come again[^h7725].
###### 6
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559], Go up[^h5927], and bury[^h6912] thy father[^h1], according as he made thee swear[^h7650].
###### 7
And Joseph[^h3130] went up[^h5927] to bury[^h6912] his father[^h1]: and with him went up[^h5927] all the servants[^h5650] of Pharaoh[^h6547], the elders[^h2205] of his house[^h1004], and all the elders[^h2205] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714],
###### 8
And all the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130], and his brethren[^h251], and his father's[^h1] house[^h1004]: only their little ones[^h2945], and their flocks[^h6629], and their herds[^h1241], they left[^h5800] in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657].
###### 9
And there went up[^h5927] with him both chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571]: and it was a very[^h3966] great[^h3515] company[^h4264].
###### 10
And they came[^h935] to the threshingfloor[^h1637] of Atad[^h329], which is beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], and there they mourned[^h5594] with a great[^h1419] and very[^h3966] sore[^h3515] lamentation[^h4553]: and he made[^h6213] a mourning[^h60] for his father[^h1] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117].
###### 11
And when the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776], the Canaanites[^h3669], saw[^h7200] the mourning[^h60] in the floor[^h1637] of Atad[^h329], they said[^h559], This is a grievous[^h3515] mourning[^h60] to the Egyptians[^h4714]: wherefore the name of it[^h8034] was called[^h7121] Abelmizraim[^h67], which is beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]. 
###### 12
And his sons[^h1121] did[^h6213] unto him according as he commanded[^h6680] them:
###### 13
For his sons[^h1121] carried[^h5375] him into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and buried[^h6912] him in the cave[^h4631] of the field[^h7704] of Machpelah[^h4375], which Abraham[^h85] bought[^h7069] with the field[^h7704] for a possession[^h272] of a buryingplace[^h6913] of Ephron[^h6085] the Hittite[^h2850], before[^h6440] Mamre[^h4471].
###### 14
And Joseph[^h3130] returned[^h7725] into Egypt[^h4714], he, and his brethren[^h251], and all that went up[^h5927] with him to bury[^h6912] his father[^h1], after[^h310] he had buried[^h6912] his father[^h1].
###### 15
And when Joseph's[^h3130] brethren[^h251] saw[^h7200] that their father[^h1] was dead[^h4191], they said[^h559], Joseph[^h3130] will peradventure[^h3863] hate us[^h7852], and will certainly[^h7725] requite[^h7725] us all the evil[^h7451] which we did[^h1580] unto him.
###### 16
And they sent a messenger[^h6680] unto Joseph[^h3130], saying[^h559], Thy father[^h1] did command[^h6680] before[^h6440] he died[^h4194], saying[^h559], 
###### 17
So shall ye say[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], Forgive[^h5375], I pray thee[^h577] now, the trespass[^h6588] of thy brethren[^h251], and their sin[^h2403]; for they did[^h1580] unto thee evil[^h7451]: and now, we pray thee, forgive[^h5375] the trespass[^h6588] of the servants[^h5650] of the God[^h430] of thy father[^h1]. And Joseph[^h3130] wept[^h1058] when they spake[^h1696] unto him.
###### 18
And his brethren[^h251] also went[^h3212] and fell down[^h5307] before his face[^h6440]; and they said[^h559], Behold, we be thy servants[^h5650].
###### 19
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto them, Fear[^h3372] not: for am I in the place of God[^h430]?
###### 20
But as for you, ye thought[^h2803] evil[^h7451] against me; but God[^h430] meant it[^h2803] unto good[^h2896], to[^h4616] bring to pass[^h6213], as it is this day[^h3117], to save[^h2421] much[^h7227] people[^h5971] alive[^h2421].
###### 21
Now therefore fear[^h3372] ye not: I will nourish[^h3557] you, and your little ones[^h2945]. And he comforted[^h5162] them, and spake[^h1696] kindly[^h3820] unto them. 
###### 22
And Joseph[^h3130] dwelt[^h3427] in Egypt[^h4714], he, and his father's[^h1] house[^h1004]: and Joseph[^h3130] lived[^h2421] an hundred[^h3967] and ten[^h6235] years[^h8141].
###### 23
And Joseph[^h3130] saw[^h7200] Ephraim's[^h669] children[^h1121] of the third[^h8029] generation: the children[^h1121] also of Machir[^h4353] the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] were brought up[^h3205] upon Joseph's[^h3130] knees[^h1290]. 
###### 24
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], I die[^h4191]: and God[^h430] will surely[^h6485] visit[^h6485] you, and bring you out[^h5927] of this land[^h776] unto the land[^h776] which he sware[^h7650] to Abraham[^h85], to Isaac[^h3327], and to Jacob[^h3290].
###### 25
And Joseph[^h3130] took an oath[^h7650] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], God[^h430] will surely[^h6485] visit[^h6485] you, and ye shall carry up[^h5927] my bones[^h6106] from hence[^h2088].
###### 26
So Joseph[^h3130] died[^h4191], being an hundred[^h3967] and ten[^h6235] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]: and they embalmed[^h2590] him, and he was put[^h3455] in a coffin[^h727] in Egypt[^h4714].

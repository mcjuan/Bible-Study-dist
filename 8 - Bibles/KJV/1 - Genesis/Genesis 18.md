###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto him in the plains[^h436] of Mamre[^h4471]: and he sat[^h3427] in the tent[^h168] door[^h6607] in the heat[^h2527] of the day[^h3117];
###### 2
And he lift up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869] and looked[^h7200], and, lo, three[^h7969] men[^h582] stood[^h5324] by him: and when he saw[^h7200] them, he ran[^h7323] to meet[^h7125] them from the tent[^h168] door[^h6607], and bowed[^h7812] himself toward the ground[^h776],
###### 3
And said[^h559], My Lord[^h136], if now I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], pass not away[^h5674], I pray thee, from thy servant[^h5650]:
###### 4
Let a little[^h4592] water[^h4325], I pray you[^h4994], be fetched[^h3947], and wash[^h7364] your feet[^h7272], and rest yourselves[^h8172] under the tree[^h6086]:
###### 5
And I will fetch[^h3947] a morsel[^h6595] of bread[^h3899], and comfort ye[^h5582] your hearts[^h3820]; after that[^h310] ye shall pass on[^h5674]: for therefore are ye come[^h5674] to[^h5921] your servant[^h5650]. And they said[^h1696], So do[^h6213], as thou hast said[^h559].  
###### 6
And Abraham[^h85] hastened[^h4116] into the tent[^h168] unto Sarah[^h8283], and said[^h559], Make ready quickly[^h4116] three[^h7969] measures[^h5429] of fine[^h5560] meal[^h7058], knead[^h3888] it, and make[^h6213] cakes[^h5692] upon the hearth[^h6213]. 
###### 7
And Abraham[^h85] ran[^h7323] unto the herd[^h1241], and fetcht[^h3947] a calf[^h1121] [^h1241] tender[^h7390] and good[^h2896], and gave[^h5414] it unto a young man[^h5288]; and he hasted[^h4116] to dress[^h6213] it.
###### 8
And he took[^h3947] butter[^h2529], and milk[^h2461], and the calf[^h1121] [^h1241] which he had dressed[^h6213], and set[^h5414] it before them[^h6440]; and he stood[^h5975] by them under the tree[^h6086], and they did eat[^h398].
###### 9
And they said[^h559] unto him, Where[^h346] is Sarah[^h8283] thy wife[^h802]? And he said[^h559], Behold, in the tent[^h168].
###### 10
And he said[^h559], I will certainly[^h7725] return[^h7725] unto thee according to the time[^h6256] of life[^h2416]; and, lo, Sarah[^h8283] thy wife[^h802] shall have a son[^h1121]. And Sarah[^h8283] heard[^h8085] it in the tent[^h168] door[^h6607], which was behind him[^h310].
###### 11
Now Abraham[^h85] and Sarah[^h8283] were old[^h2205] and well stricken[^h935] in age[^h3117]; and it ceased[^h2308] to be with Sarah[^h8283] after the manner[^h734] of women[^h802].
###### 12
Therefore Sarah[^h8283] laughed[^h6711] within herself[^h7130], saying[^h559], After[^h310] I am waxed old[^h1086] shall I have pleasure[^h5730], my lord[^h113] being old also[^h2204]?
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], Wherefore[^h4100] did Sarah[^h8283] laugh[^h6711], saying[^h559], Shall I of a surety[^h552] bear[^h3205] a child, which[^h589] am old[^h2204]?
###### 14
Is[^h6381] any thing[^h1697] too hard[^h6381] for the LORD[^h3068]? At the time appointed[^h4150] I will return[^h7725] unto thee, according to the time[^h6256] of life[^h2416], and Sarah[^h8283] shall have a son[^h1121].
###### 15
Then Sarah[^h8283] denied[^h3584], saying[^h559], I laughed[^h6711] not; for she was afraid[^h3372]. And he said[^h559], Nay[^h3808]; but thou didst laugh[^h6711].
###### 16
And the men[^h582] rose up[^h6965] from thence, and looked[^h8259] toward[^h6440] Sodom[^h5467]: and Abraham[^h85] went[^h1980] with them to bring them on the way[^h7971].
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Shall I hide[^h3680] from Abraham[^h85] that thing which[^h834] I do[^h6213];
###### 18
Seeing that Abraham[^h85] shall surely become a great[^h1419] and mighty[^h6099] nation[^h1471], and all the nations[^h1471] of the earth[^h776] shall be blessed[^h1288] in him?
###### 19
For I know[^h3045] him, that[^h834] he will command[^h6680] his children[^h1121] and his household[^h1004] after him[^h310], and they shall keep[^h8104] the way[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068], to do[^h6213] justice[^h6666] and judgment[^h4941]; that the LORD[^h3068] may bring[^h935] upon Abraham[^h85] that which he hath spoken[^h1696] of him.
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Because the cry[^h2201] of Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017] is great[^h7227], and because their sin[^h2403] is very[^h3966] grievous[^h3513];
###### 21
I will go down[^h3381] now, and see[^h7200] whether they have done[^h6213] altogether[^h3617] according to the cry[^h6818] of it, which is come[^h935] unto me; and if not, I will know[^h3045].
###### 22
And the men[^h582] turned their faces[^h6437] from thence, and went[^h3212] toward Sodom[^h5467]: but Abraham[^h85] stood[^h5975] yet[^h5750] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
And Abraham[^h85] drew near[^h5066], and said[^h559], Wilt thou also destroy[^h5595] the righteous[^h6662] with[^h5973] the wicked[^h7563]?
###### 24
Peradventure there be[^h3426] fifty[^h2572] righteous[^h6662] within[^h8432] the city[^h5892]: wilt thou also destroy[^h5595] and not spare[^h5375] the place[^h4725] for[^h4616] the fifty[^h2572] righteous[^h6662] that are therein[^h7130]?
###### 25
That be far[^h2486] from thee to do[^h6213] after this manner[^h1697], to slay[^h4191] the righteous[^h6662] with the wicked[^h7563]: and that the righteous[^h6662] should be as the wicked[^h7563], that be far[^h2486] from thee: Shall not the Judge[^h8199] of all the earth[^h776] do[^h6213] right[^h4941]?
###### 26
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], If I find[^h4672] in Sodom[^h5467] fifty[^h2572] righteous[^h6662] within[^h8432] the city[^h5892], then I will spare[^h5375] all the place[^h4725] for their sakes.
###### 27
And Abraham[^h85] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Behold now, I have taken upon me[^h2974] to speak[^h1696] unto the Lord[^h136], which[^h595] am but dust[^h6083] and ashes[^h665]:
###### 28
Peradventure there shall lack[^h2637] five[^h2568] of the fifty[^h2572] righteous[^h6662]: wilt thou destroy[^h7843] all the city[^h5892] for lack of five[^h2568]? And he said[^h559], If I find[^h4672] there forty[^h705] and five[^h2568], I will not destroy[^h7843] it.
###### 29
And he spake[^h1696] unto him yet again[^h3254], and said[^h559], Peradventure there shall be forty[^h705] found[^h4672] there. And he said[^h559], I will not do[^h6213] it for forty's[^h705] sake.
###### 30
And he said[^h559] unto him, Oh[^h4994] let not the Lord[^h136] be angry[^h2734], and I will speak[^h1696]: Peradventure there shall thirty[^h7970] be found[^h4672] there. And he said[^h559], I will not do[^h6213] it, if I find[^h4672] thirty[^h7970] there.
###### 31
And he said[^h559], Behold now, I have taken upon me[^h2974] to speak[^h1696] unto the Lord[^h136]: Peradventure there shall be twenty[^h6242] found[^h4672] there. And he said[^h559], I will not destroy[^h7843] it for twenty's[^h6242] sake.
###### 32
And he said[^h559], Oh let not the Lord[^h136] be angry[^h2734], and I will speak[^h1696] yet[^h389] but this once[^h6471]: Peradventure ten[^h6235] shall be found[^h4672] there. And he said[^h559], I will not destroy[^h7843] it for ten's[^h6235] sake.
###### 33
And the LORD[^h3068] went his way[^h3212], as soon as[^h834] he had left[^h3615] communing[^h1696] with Abraham[^h85]: and Abraham[^h85] returned[^h7725] unto his place[^h4725].

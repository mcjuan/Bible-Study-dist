###### 1
And when Abram[^h87] was ninety[^h8673] [^h8141] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and nine[^h8672], the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] to Abram[^h87], and said[^h559] unto him, I am the Almighty[^h7706] God[^h410]; walk[^h1980] before me[^h6440], and be thou perfect[^h8549]. 
###### 2
And I will make[^h5414] my covenant[^h1285] between me and thee, and will multiply[^h7235] thee exceedingly[^h3966] [^h3966].
###### 3
And Abram[^h87] fell[^h5307] on his face[^h6440]: and God[^h430] talked[^h1696] with him, saying[^h559],
###### 4
As for me[^h589], behold, my covenant[^h1285] is with thee, and thou shalt be a father[^h1] of many[^h1995] nations[^h1471]. 
###### 5
Neither shall thy name[^h8034] any more be called[^h7121] Abram[^h87], but thy name[^h8034] shall be Abraham[^h85]; for a father[^h1] of many[^h1995] nations[^h1471] have I made thee[^h5414]. 
###### 6
And I will make[^h6509] thee exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] fruitful[^h6509], and I will make[^h5414] nations[^h1471] of thee, and kings[^h4428] shall come out[^h3318] of thee.
###### 7
And I will establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] between me and thee and thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310] in their generations[^h1755] for an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285], to be a God[^h430] unto thee, and to thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310].
###### 8
And I will give[^h5414] unto thee, and to thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310], the land[^h776] wherein thou art a stranger[^h4033], all the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], for an everlasting[^h5769] possession[^h272]; and I will be their God[^h430]. 
###### 9
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], Thou shalt keep[^h8104] my covenant[^h1285] therefore, thou, and thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310] in their generations[^h1755].
###### 10
This is my covenant[^h1285], which ye shall keep[^h8104], between me and you and thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310]; Every man child[^h2145] among you shall be circumcised[^h4135].
###### 11
And ye shall circumcise[^h5243] the flesh[^h1320] of your foreskin[^h6190]; and it shall be a token[^h226] of the covenant[^h1285] betwixt me and you.
###### 12
And he that is eight[^h8083] days[^h3117] old[^h1121] shall be circumcised[^h4135] among you, every man child[^h2145] in your generations[^h1755], he that is born[^h3211] in the house[^h1004], or bought[^h4736] with money[^h3701] of any stranger[^h1121] [^h5236], which is not of thy seed[^h2233]. 
###### 13
He that is born[^h3211] in thy house[^h1004], and he that is bought[^h4736] with thy money[^h3701], must needs[^h4135] be circumcised[^h4135]: and my covenant[^h1285] shall be in your flesh[^h1320] for an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285].
###### 14
And the uncircumcised[^h6189] man child[^h2145] whose[^h834] flesh[^h1320] of his foreskin[^h6190] is not circumcised[^h4135], that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from his people[^h5971]; he hath broken[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285].
###### 15
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], As for Sarai[^h8297] thy wife[^h802], thou shalt not call[^h7121] her name[^h8034] Sarai[^h8297], but[^h3588] Sarah[^h8283] shall her name[^h8034] be. 
###### 16
And I will bless[^h1288] her, and give[^h5414] thee a son[^h1121] also of her: yea, I will bless[^h1288] her, and she shall be a mother of nations[^h1471]; kings[^h4428] of people[^h5971] shall be of her. 
###### 17
Then Abraham[^h85] fell[^h5307] upon his face[^h6440], and laughed[^h6711], and said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], Shall a child be born[^h3205] unto him that is an hundred[^h3967] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]? and shall Sarah[^h8283], that is ninety[^h8673] years[^h8141] old[^h1323], bear[^h3205]?
###### 18
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], O that[^h3863] Ishmael[^h3458] might live[^h2421] before thee[^h6440]!
###### 19
And God[^h430] said[^h559], Sarah[^h8283] thy wife[^h802] shall bear[^h3205] thee a son[^h1121] indeed[^h61]; and thou shalt call[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Isaac[^h3327]: and I will establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] with him for an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285], and with his seed[^h2233] after him[^h310].
###### 20
And as for Ishmael[^h3458], I have heard thee[^h8085]: Behold, I have blessed[^h1288] him, and will make him fruitful[^h6509], and will multiply[^h7235] him exceedingly[^h3966] [^h3966]; twelve[^h6240] [^h8147] princes[^h5387] shall he beget[^h3205], and I will make him[^h5414] a great[^h1419] nation[^h1471].
###### 21
But my covenant[^h1285] will I establish[^h6965] with Isaac[^h3327], which Sarah[^h8283] shall bear[^h3205] unto thee at this set time[^h4150] in the next[^h312] year[^h8141].
###### 22
And he left off[^h3615] talking[^h1696] with him, and God[^h430] went up[^h5927] from Abraham[^h85].
###### 23
And Abraham[^h85] took[^h3947] Ishmael[^h3458] his son[^h1121], and all that were born[^h3211] in his house[^h1004], and all that were bought[^h4736] with his money[^h3701], every male[^h2145] among the men[^h582] of Abraham's[^h85] house[^h1004]; and circumcised[^h4135] the flesh[^h1320] of their foreskin[^h6190] in the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117], as God[^h430] had said[^h1696] unto him.
###### 24
And Abraham[^h85] was ninety[^h8673] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and nine[^h8672], when he was circumcised[^h4135] in the flesh[^h1320] of his foreskin[^h6190].
###### 25
And Ishmael[^h3458] his son[^h1121] was thirteen[^h6240] [^h7969] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], when he was circumcised[^h4135] in the flesh[^h1320] of his foreskin[^h6190].
###### 26
In the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117] was Abraham[^h85] circumcised[^h4135], and Ishmael[^h3458] his son[^h1121].
###### 27
And all the men[^h582] of his house[^h1004], born[^h3211] in the house[^h1004], and bought[^h4736] with money[^h3701] of the stranger[^h1121] [^h5236], were circumcised[^h4135] with him.

###### 1
And when Rachel[^h7354] saw[^h7200] that she bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] no children, Rachel[^h7354] envied[^h7065] her sister[^h269]; and said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], Give[^h3051] me children[^h1121], or else[^h369] I die[^h4191].
###### 2
And Jacob's[^h3290] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against Rachel[^h7354]: and he said[^h559], Am I in God's[^h430] stead, who hath withheld[^h4513] from thee the fruit[^h6529] of the womb[^h990]?
###### 3
And she said[^h559], Behold my maid[^h519] Bilhah[^h1090], go in[^h935] unto her; and she shall bear[^h3205] upon my knees[^h1290], that I may also have children[^h1129] by her. 
###### 4
And she gave[^h5414] him Bilhah[^h1090] her handmaid[^h8198] to wife[^h802]: and Jacob[^h3290] went in[^h935] unto her.
###### 5
And Bilhah[^h1090] conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] a son[^h1121].
###### 6
And Rachel[^h7354] said[^h559], God[^h430] hath judged[^h1777] me, and hath also heard[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], and hath given[^h5414] me a son[^h1121]: therefore called[^h7121] she his name[^h8034] Dan[^h1835]. 
###### 7
And Bilhah[^h1090] Rachel's[^h7354] maid[^h8198] conceived[^h2029] again, and bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] a second[^h8145] son[^h1121].
###### 8
And Rachel[^h7354] said[^h559], With great[^h430] wrestlings[^h5319] have I wrestled[^h6617] with my sister[^h269], and I have prevailed[^h3201]: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Naphtali[^h5321].  
###### 9
When Leah[^h3812] saw[^h7200] that she had left[^h5975] bearing[^h3205], she took[^h3947] Zilpah[^h2153] her maid[^h8198], and gave[^h5414] her Jacob[^h3290] to wife[^h802].
###### 10
And Zilpah[^h2153] Leah's[^h3812] maid[^h8198] bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] a son[^h1121].
###### 11
And Leah[^h3812] said[^h559], A troop[^h1409] cometh[^h935]: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Gad[^h1410]. 
###### 12
And Zilpah[^h2153] Leah's[^h3812] maid[^h8198] bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] a second[^h8145] son[^h1121].
###### 13
And Leah[^h3812] said[^h559], Happy am I[^h837], for the daughters[^h1323] will call me blessed[^h833]: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Asher[^h836].  
###### 14
And Reuben[^h7205] went in[^h3212] the days[^h3117] of wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105], and found[^h4672] mandrakes[^h1736] in the field[^h7704], and brought[^h935] them unto his mother[^h517] Leah[^h3812]. Then Rachel[^h7354] said[^h559] to Leah[^h3812], Give me[^h5414], I pray thee, of thy son's[^h1121] mandrakes[^h1736].
###### 15
And she said[^h559] unto her, Is it a small matter[^h4592] that thou hast taken[^h3947] my husband[^h376]? and wouldest thou take away[^h3947] my son's[^h1121] mandrakes[^h1736] also? And Rachel[^h7354] said[^h559], Therefore he shall lie[^h7901] with thee to night[^h3915] for[^h8478] thy son's[^h1121] mandrakes[^h1736].
###### 16
And Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] out of the field[^h7704] in the evening[^h6153], and Leah[^h3812] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him, and said[^h559], Thou must come in[^h935] unto me; for surely[^h7936] I have hired[^h7936] thee with my son's[^h1121] mandrakes[^h1736]. And he lay[^h7901] with her that night[^h3915].
###### 17
And God[^h430] hearkened[^h8085] unto Leah[^h3812], and she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] the fifth[^h2549] son[^h1121].
###### 18
And Leah[^h3812] said[^h559], God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] me my hire[^h7939], because[^h834] I have given[^h5414] my maiden[^h8198] to my husband[^h376]: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Issachar[^h3485]. 
###### 19
And Leah[^h3812] conceived[^h2029] again, and bare[^h3205] Jacob[^h3290] the sixth[^h8345] son[^h1121].
###### 20
And Leah[^h3812] said[^h559], God[^h430] hath endued[^h2064] me with a good[^h2896] dowry[^h2065]; now[^h6471] will my husband[^h376] dwell[^h2082] with me, because I have born[^h3205] him six[^h8337] sons[^h1121]: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Zebulun[^h2074]. 
###### 21
And afterwards[^h310] she bare[^h3205] a daughter[^h1323], and called[^h7121] her name[^h8034] Dinah[^h1783]. 
###### 22
And God[^h430] remembered[^h2142] Rachel[^h7354], and God[^h430] hearkened[^h8085] to her, and opened[^h6605] her womb[^h7358].
###### 23
And she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and said[^h559], God[^h430] hath taken away[^h622] my reproach[^h2781]:
###### 24
And she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Joseph[^h3130]; and said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] shall add[^h3254] to me another[^h312] son[^h1121]. 
###### 25
And it came to pass, when Rachel[^h7354] had born[^h3205] Joseph[^h3130], that Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto Laban[^h3837], Send me away[^h7971], that I may go[^h3212] unto mine own place[^h4725], and to my country[^h776].
###### 26
Give[^h5414] me my wives[^h802] and my children[^h3206], for[^h2004] whom I have served[^h5647] thee, and let me go[^h3212]: for thou knowest[^h3045] my service[^h5656] which I have done[^h5647] thee.
###### 27
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559] unto him, I pray thee, if I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869], tarry: for I have learned by experience[^h5172] that the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] me for thy sake[^h1558].
###### 28
And he said[^h559], Appoint[^h5344] me thy wages[^h7939], and I will give[^h5414] it.
###### 29
And he said[^h559] unto him, Thou knowest[^h3045] how[^h834] I have served[^h5647] thee, and how[^h834] thy cattle[^h4735] was with me.
###### 30
For it was little[^h4592] which thou hadst before I[^h6440] came, and it is now increased[^h6555] unto a multitude[^h7230]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] thee since my coming[^h7272]: and now when[^h4970] shall I provide[^h6213] for mine own house[^h1004] also?  
###### 31
And he said[^h559], What shall I give thee[^h5414]? And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559], Thou shalt not give[^h5414] me any thing[^h3972]: if thou wilt do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] for me, I will again[^h7725] feed[^h7462] and keep[^h8104] thy flock[^h6629]:
###### 32
I will pass[^h5674] through all thy flock[^h6629] to day[^h3117], removing[^h5493] from thence all the speckled[^h5348] and spotted[^h2921] cattle[^h7716], and all the brown[^h2345] cattle[^h7716] among the sheep[^h3775], and the spotted[^h2921] and speckled[^h5348] among the goats[^h5795]: and of such shall be my hire[^h7939].
###### 33
So shall my righteousness[^h6666] answer[^h6030] for me in time[^h3117] to come[^h4279], when it shall come[^h935] for my hire[^h7939] before thy face[^h6440]: every one[^h3605] that is not speckled[^h5348] and spotted[^h2921] among the goats[^h5795], and brown[^h2345] among the sheep[^h3775], that shall be counted stolen[^h1589] with me. 
###### 34
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559], Behold, I would it might be[^h3863] according to thy word[^h1697].
###### 35
And he removed[^h5493] that day[^h3117] the he goats[^h8495] that were ringstraked[^h6124] and spotted[^h2921], and all the she goats[^h5795] that were speckled[^h5348] and spotted[^h2921], and every one that had some white[^h3836] in it, and all the brown[^h2345] among the sheep[^h3775], and gave[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of his sons[^h1121].
###### 36
And he set[^h7760] three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870] betwixt himself and Jacob[^h3290]: and Jacob[^h3290] fed[^h7462] the rest[^h3498] of Laban's[^h3837] flocks[^h6629].
###### 37
And Jacob[^h3290] took[^h3947] him rods[^h4731] of green[^h3892] poplar[^h3839], and of the hazel[^h3869] and chesnut tree[^h6196]; and pilled[^h6478] white[^h3836] strakes[^h6479] in them, and made the white[^h3836] appear[^h4286] which was in the rods[^h4731].
###### 38
And he set[^h3322] the rods[^h4731] which he had pilled[^h6478] before[^h5227] the flocks[^h6629] in the gutters[^h7298] in the watering[^h4325] troughs[^h8268] when the flocks[^h6629] came[^h935] to drink[^h8354], that they should conceive[^h3179] when they came[^h935] to drink[^h8354].
###### 39
And the flocks[^h6629] conceived[^h3179] before the rods[^h4731], and brought forth[^h3205] cattle[^h6629] ringstraked[^h6124], speckled[^h5348], and spotted[^h2921].
###### 40
And Jacob[^h3290] did separate[^h6504] the lambs[^h3775], and set[^h5414] the faces[^h6440] of the flocks[^h6629] toward[^h413] the ringstraked[^h6124], and all the brown[^h2345] in the flock[^h6629] of Laban[^h3837]; and he put[^h7896] his own flocks[^h5739] by themselves, and put[^h7896] them not unto Laban's[^h3837] cattle[^h6629].
###### 41
And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger[^h7194] cattle[^h6629] did conceive[^h3179], that Jacob[^h3290] laid[^h7760] the rods[^h4731] before the eyes[^h5869] of the cattle[^h6629] in the gutters[^h7298], that they might conceive[^h3179] among the rods[^h4731].
###### 42
But when the cattle[^h6629] were feeble[^h5848], he put them not in[^h7760]: so the feebler[^h5848] were Laban's[^h3837], and the stronger[^h7194] Jacob's[^h3290].
###### 43
And the man[^h376] increased[^h6555] exceedingly[^h3966] [^h3966], and had much[^h7227] cattle[^h6629], and maidservants[^h8198], and menservants[^h5650], and camels[^h1581], and asses[^h2543].

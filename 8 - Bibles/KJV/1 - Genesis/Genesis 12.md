###### 1
Now the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h559] unto Abram[^h87], Get thee out[^h3212] of thy country[^h776], and from thy kindred[^h4138], and from thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], unto a land[^h776] that I will shew[^h7200] thee:
###### 2
And I will make of thee[^h6213] a great[^h1419] nation[^h1471], and I will bless[^h1288] thee, and make[^h1431] thy name[^h8034] great[^h1431]; and thou shalt be a blessing[^h1293]:
###### 3
And I will bless[^h1288] them that bless[^h1288] thee, and curse[^h779] him that curseth[^h7043] thee: and in thee shall all families[^h4940] of the earth[^h127] be blessed[^h1288].
###### 4
So Abram[^h87] departed[^h3212], as the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] unto him; and Lot[^h3876] went[^h3212] with him: and Abram[^h87] was seventy[^h7657] [^h8141] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he departed[^h3318] out of Haran[^h2771].
###### 5
And Abram[^h87] took[^h3947] Sarai[^h8297] his wife[^h802], and Lot[^h3876] his brother's[^h251] son[^h1121], and all their substance[^h7399] that they had gathered[^h7408], and the souls[^h5315] that they had gotten[^h6213] in Haran[^h2771]; and they went forth[^h3318] to go[^h3212] into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]; and into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] they came[^h935].
###### 6
And Abram[^h87] passed through[^h5674] the land[^h776] unto the place[^h4725] of Sichem[^h7927], unto the plain[^h436] of Moreh[^h4176]. And the Canaanite[^h3669] was then[^h227] in the land[^h776].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto Abram[^h87], and said[^h559], Unto thy seed[^h2233] will I give[^h5414] this[^h2063] land[^h776]: and there builded[^h1129] he an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068], who appeared[^h7200] unto him.
###### 8
And he removed[^h6275] from thence unto a mountain[^h2022] on the east[^h6924] of Bethel[^h1008], and pitched[^h5186] his tent[^h168], having Bethel[^h1008] on the west[^h3220], and Hai[^h5857] on the east[^h6924]: and there he builded[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068], and called[^h7121] upon the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And Abram[^h87] journeyed[^h5265], going on[^h1980] still[^h5265] toward the south[^h5045]. 
###### 10
And there was a famine[^h7458] in the land[^h776]: and Abram[^h87] went down[^h3381] into Egypt[^h4714] to sojourn[^h1481] there; for the famine[^h7458] was grievous[^h3515] in the land[^h776].
###### 11
And it came to pass, when[^h834] he was come near[^h7126] to enter[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714], that he said[^h559] unto Sarai[^h8297] his wife[^h802], Behold[^h2009] now[^h4994], I know[^h3045] that thou art a fair[^h3303] woman[^h802] to look upon[^h4758]:
###### 12
Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians[^h4713] shall see[^h7200] thee, that they shall say[^h559], This is his wife[^h802]: and they will kill[^h2026] me, but they will save thee alive[^h2421].
###### 13
Say[^h559], I pray thee[^h4994], thou art my sister[^h269]: that[^h4616] it may be well[^h3190] with me for thy sake; and my soul[^h5315] shall live[^h2421] because of thee[^h1558].
###### 14
And it came to pass, that, when Abram[^h87] was come[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714], the Egyptians[^h4713] beheld[^h7200] the woman[^h802] that she was very[^h3966] fair[^h3303].
###### 15
The princes[^h8269] also of Pharaoh[^h6547] saw[^h7200] her, and commended[^h1984] her before[^h413] Pharaoh[^h6547]: and the woman[^h802] was taken[^h3947] into Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004].
###### 16
And he entreated[^h3190] Abram[^h87] well[^h3190] for her sake: and he had sheep[^h6629], and oxen[^h1241], and he asses[^h2543], and menservants[^h5650], and maidservants[^h8198], and she asses[^h860], and camels[^h1581].
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] plagued[^h5060] Pharaoh[^h6547] and his house[^h1004] with great[^h1419] plagues[^h5061] because of[^h1697] Sarai[^h8297] Abram's[^h87] wife[^h802].
###### 18
And Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] Abram[^h87], and said[^h559], What is this that thou hast done[^h6213] unto me? why didst thou not tell[^h5046] me that she was thy wife[^h802]?
###### 19
Why saidst thou[^h559], She is my sister[^h269]? so I might have taken[^h3947] her to me to wife[^h802]: now therefore behold thy wife[^h802], take[^h3947] her, and go thy way[^h3212].
###### 20
And Pharaoh[^h6547] commanded[^h6680] his men[^h582] concerning him: and they sent him away[^h7971], and his wife[^h802], and all that he had.

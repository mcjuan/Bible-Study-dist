###### 1
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], Arise[^h6965], go up[^h5927] to Bethel[^h1008], and dwell[^h3427] there: and make[^h6213] there an altar[^h4196] unto God[^h410], that appeared[^h7200] unto thee when thou fleddest[^h1272] from the face[^h6440] of Esau[^h6215] thy brother[^h251].
###### 2
Then Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto his household[^h1004], and to all that were with him, Put away[^h5493] the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430] that are among you[^h8432], and be clean[^h2891], and change[^h2498] your garments[^h8071]:
###### 3
And let us arise[^h6965], and go up[^h5927] to Bethel[^h1008]; and I will make[^h6213] there an altar[^h4196] unto God[^h410], who answered[^h6030] me in the day[^h3117] of my distress[^h6869], and was with me in the way[^h1870] which I went[^h1980].
###### 4
And they gave[^h5414] unto Jacob[^h3290] all the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430] which were in their hand[^h3027], and all their earrings[^h5141] which were in their ears[^h241]; and Jacob[^h3290] hid[^h2934] them under the oak[^h424] which was by Shechem[^h7927].
###### 5
And they journeyed[^h5265]: and the terror[^h2847] of God[^h430] was upon the cities[^h5892] that were round about[^h5439] them, and they did not pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290].
###### 6
So Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] to Luz[^h3870], which is in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], that is, Bethel[^h1008], he and all the people[^h5971] that were with him.
###### 7
And he built[^h1129] there an altar[^h4196], and called[^h7121] the place[^h4725] Elbethel[^h416]: because there God[^h430] appeared[^h1540] unto him, when he fled[^h1272] from the face[^h6440] of his brother[^h251]. 
###### 8
But Deborah[^h1683] Rebekah's[^h7259] nurse[^h3243] died[^h4191], and she was buried[^h6912] beneath Bethel[^h1008] under an oak[^h437]: and the name[^h8034] of it was called[^h7121] Allonbachuth[^h439]. 
###### 9
And God[^h430] appeared[^h7200] unto Jacob[^h3290] again, when he came[^h935] out of Padanaram[^h6307], and blessed[^h1288] him.
###### 10
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto him, Thy name[^h8034] is Jacob[^h3290]: thy name[^h8034] shall not be called[^h7121] any more Jacob[^h3290], but Israel[^h3478] shall be thy name[^h8034]: and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto him, I am God[^h410] Almighty[^h7706]: be fruitful[^h6509] and multiply[^h7235]; a nation[^h1471] and a company[^h6951] of nations[^h1471] shall be of thee, and kings[^h4428] shall come[^h3318] out of thy loins[^h2504];
###### 12
And the land[^h776] which I gave[^h5414] Abraham[^h85] and Isaac[^h3327], to thee I will give it[^h5414], and to thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310] will I give[^h5414] the land[^h776].
###### 13
And God[^h430] went up[^h5927] from him in the place[^h4725] where he talked[^h1696] with him.
###### 14
And Jacob[^h3290] set up[^h5324] a pillar[^h4676] in the place[^h4725] where he talked[^h1696] with him, even a pillar[^h4678] of stone[^h68]: and he poured[^h5258] a drink offering[^h5262] thereon, and he poured[^h3332] oil[^h8081] thereon.
###### 15
And Jacob[^h3290] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the place[^h4725] where God[^h430] spake[^h1696] with him, Bethel[^h1008].
###### 16
And they journeyed[^h5265] from Bethel[^h1008]; and there was but[^h5750] a little[^h3530] way[^h776] to come[^h935] to Ephrath[^h672]: and Rachel[^h7354] travailed[^h3205], and she had hard[^h7185] labour[^h3205]. 
###### 17
And it came to pass, when she was in hard[^h7185] labour[^h3205], that the midwife[^h3205] said[^h559] unto her, Fear[^h3372] not; thou shalt have this son[^h1121] also.
###### 18
And it came to pass, as her soul[^h5315] was in departing[^h3318], (for she died[^h4191]) that she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Benoni[^h1126]: but his father[^h1] called[^h7121] him Benjamin[^h1144].  
###### 19
And Rachel[^h7354] died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in the way[^h1870] to Ephrath[^h672], which is Bethlehem[^h1035].
###### 20
And Jacob[^h3290] set[^h5324] a pillar[^h4676] upon her grave[^h6900]: that is the pillar[^h4678] of Rachel's[^h7354] grave[^h6900] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 21
And Israel[^h3478] journeyed[^h5265], and spread[^h5186] his tent[^h168] beyond[^h1973] the tower[^h4026] of Edar[^h4029].
###### 22
And it came to pass, when Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h7931] in that land[^h776], that Reuben[^h7205] went[^h3212] and lay[^h7901] with Bilhah[^h1090] his father's[^h1] concubine[^h6370]: and Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] it. Now the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] were twelve[^h8147] [^h6240]:
###### 23
The sons[^h1121] of Leah[^h3812]; Reuben[^h7205], Jacob's[^h3290] firstborn[^h1060], and Simeon[^h8095], and Levi[^h3878], and Judah[^h3063], and Issachar[^h3485], and Zebulun[^h2074]:
###### 24
The sons[^h1121] of Rachel[^h7354]; Joseph[^h3130], and Benjamin[^h1144]:
###### 25
And the sons[^h1121] of Bilhah[^h1090], Rachel's[^h7354] handmaid[^h8198]; Dan[^h1835], and Naphtali[^h5321]:
###### 26
And the sons[^h1121] of Zilpah[^h2153], Leah's[^h3812] handmaid[^h8198]; Gad[^h1410], and Asher[^h836]: these are the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290], which were born[^h3205] to him in Padanaram[^h6307].
###### 27
And Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] unto Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1] unto Mamre[^h4471], unto the city of Arbah[^h7153], which is Hebron[^h2275], where Abraham[^h85] and Isaac[^h3327] sojourned[^h1481].
###### 28
And the days[^h3117] of Isaac[^h3327] were an hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and fourscore[^h8084] years[^h8141].
###### 29
And Isaac[^h3327] gave up the ghost[^h1478], and died[^h4191], and was gathered[^h622] unto his people[^h5971], being old[^h2205] and full[^h7649] of days[^h3117]: and his sons[^h1121] Esau[^h6215] and Jacob[^h3290] buried[^h6912] him.

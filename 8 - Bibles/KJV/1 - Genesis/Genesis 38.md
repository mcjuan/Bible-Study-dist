###### 1
And it came to pass at that time[^h6256], that Judah[^h3063] went down[^h3381] from his brethren[^h251], and turned[^h5186] in to a certain[^h376] Adullamite[^h5726], whose name[^h8034] was Hirah[^h2437].
###### 2
And Judah[^h3063] saw[^h7200] there a daughter[^h1323] of a certain[^h376] Canaanite[^h3669], whose name[^h8034] was Shuah[^h7770]; and he took her[^h3947], and went in[^h935] unto her.
###### 3
And she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Er[^h6147].
###### 4
And she conceived[^h2029] again, and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Onan[^h209].
###### 5
And she yet again conceived[^h3254], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Shelah[^h7956]: and he was at Chezib[^h3580], when she bare[^h3205] him.
###### 6
And Judah[^h3063] took[^h3947] a wife[^h802] for Er[^h6147] his firstborn[^h1060], whose name[^h8034] was Tamar[^h8559].
###### 7
And Er[^h6147], Judah's[^h3063] firstborn[^h1060], was wicked[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]; and the LORD[^h3068] slew[^h4191] him.
###### 8
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559] unto Onan[^h209], Go in[^h935] unto thy brother's[^h251] wife[^h802], and marry[^h2992] her, and raise up[^h6965] seed[^h2233] to thy brother[^h251].
###### 9
And Onan[^h209] knew[^h3045] that the seed[^h2233] should not be his; and it came to pass, when[^h518] he went in[^h935] unto his brother's[^h251] wife[^h802], that he spilled[^h7843] it on the ground[^h776], lest[^h1115] that he should give[^h5414] seed[^h2233] to his brother[^h251].
###### 10
And the thing which[^h834] he did[^h6213] displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] the LORD[^h3068]: wherefore he slew[^h4191] him also. 
###### 11
Then said[^h559] Judah[^h3063] to Tamar[^h8559] his daughter in law[^h3618], Remain[^h3427] a widow[^h490] at thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], till Shelah[^h7956] my son[^h1121] be grown[^h1431]: for he said[^h559], Lest peradventure he die[^h4191] also, as his brethren[^h251] did. And Tamar[^h8559] went[^h3212] and dwelt[^h3427] in her father's[^h1] house[^h1004].
###### 12
And in process[^h7235] of time[^h3117] the daughter[^h1323] of Shuah[^h7770] Judah's[^h3063] wife[^h802] died[^h4191]; and Judah[^h3063] was comforted[^h5162], and went up[^h5927] unto his sheepshearers[^h1494] [^h6629] to Timnath[^h8553], he and his friend[^h7453] Hirah[^h2437] the Adullamite[^h5726]. 
###### 13
And it was told[^h5046] Tamar[^h8559], saying[^h559], Behold thy father in law[^h2524] goeth up[^h5927] to Timnath[^h8553] to shear[^h1494] his sheep[^h6629].
###### 14
And she put[^h5493] her widow's[^h491] garments[^h899] off[^h5493] from her, and covered her[^h3680] with a vail[^h6809], and wrapped herself[^h5968], and sat in[^h3427] an open[^h5869] place[^h6607], which is by the way[^h1870] to Timnath[^h8553]; for she saw[^h7200] that Shelah[^h7956] was grown[^h1431], and she was not given[^h5414] unto him to wife[^h802]. 
###### 15
When Judah[^h3063] saw her[^h7200], he thought[^h2803] her to be an harlot[^h2181]; because she had covered[^h3680] her face[^h6440].
###### 16
And he turned[^h5186] unto her by the way[^h1870], and said[^h559], Go to[^h3051], I pray thee, let me come in[^h935] unto thee; (for he knew[^h3045] not that she was his daughter in law[^h3618].) And she said[^h559], What wilt thou give[^h5414] me, that thou mayest come in[^h935] unto me?
###### 17
And he said[^h559], I will send[^h7971] thee a kid[^h5795] [^h1423] from the flock[^h6629]. And she said[^h559], Wilt thou give[^h5414] me a pledge[^h6162], till thou send[^h7971] it? 
###### 18
And he said[^h559], What[^h834] pledge[^h6162] shall I give[^h5414] thee? And she said[^h559], Thy signet[^h2368], and thy bracelets[^h6616], and thy staff[^h4294] that is in thine hand[^h3027]. And he gave[^h5414] it her, and came in[^h935] unto her, and she conceived[^h2029] by him.
###### 19
And she arose[^h6965], and went away[^h3212], and laid by[^h5493] her vail[^h6809] from her, and put on[^h3847] the garments[^h899] of her widowhood[^h491].
###### 20
And Judah[^h3063] sent[^h7971] the kid[^h1423] [^h5795] by the hand[^h3027] of his friend[^h7453] the Adullamite[^h5726], to receive[^h3947] his pledge[^h6162] from the woman's[^h802] hand[^h3027]: but he found her[^h4672] not.
###### 21
Then he asked[^h7592] the men[^h582] of that place[^h4725], saying[^h559], Where is the harlot[^h6948], that was openly[^h5869] by the way side[^h1870]? And they said[^h559], There was no harlot[^h6948] in this[^h2088] place. 
###### 22
And he returned[^h7725] to Judah[^h3063], and said[^h559], I cannot[^h3808] find[^h4672] her; and also the men[^h582] of the place[^h4725] said[^h559], that there was no harlot[^h6948] in this place.
###### 23
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559], Let her take[^h3947] it to her, lest we be shamed[^h937]: behold, I sent[^h7971] this kid[^h1423], and thou hast not found[^h4672] her. 
###### 24
And it came to pass about three[^h7969] months[^h2320] after, that it was told[^h5046] Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], Tamar[^h8559] thy daughter in law[^h3618] hath played the harlot[^h2181]; and also, behold, she is with child[^h2030] by whoredom[^h2183]. And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559], Bring her forth[^h3318], and let her be burnt[^h8313].
###### 25
When she was brought forth[^h3318], she sent[^h7971] to her father in law[^h2524], saying[^h559], By the man[^h376], whose these are, am I with child[^h2030]: and she said[^h559], Discern[^h5234], I pray thee, whose are these, the signet[^h2858], and bracelets[^h6616], and staff[^h4294].
###### 26
And Judah[^h3063] acknowledged[^h5234] them, and said[^h559], She hath been more righteous[^h6663] than I; because that I gave[^h5414] her not to Shelah[^h7956] my son[^h1121]. And he knew her[^h3045] again[^h3254] no more.
###### 27
And it came to pass in the time[^h6256] of her travail[^h3205], that, behold, twins[^h8380] were in her womb[^h990].
###### 28
And it came to pass, when she travailed[^h3205], that the one put out[^h5414] his hand[^h3027]: and the midwife[^h3205] took[^h3947] and bound[^h7194] upon his hand[^h3027] a scarlet thread[^h8144], saying[^h559], This came out[^h3318] first[^h7223].
###### 29
And it came to pass, as he drew back[^h7725] his hand[^h3027], that, behold, his brother[^h251] came out[^h3318]: and she said[^h559], How hast thou broken forth[^h6555]? this breach[^h6556] be upon thee: therefore his name[^h8034] was called[^h7121] Pharez[^h6557].  
###### 30
And afterward[^h310] came out[^h3318] his brother[^h251], that had the scarlet thread[^h8144] upon his hand[^h3027]: and his name[^h8034] was called[^h7121] Zarah[^h2226].

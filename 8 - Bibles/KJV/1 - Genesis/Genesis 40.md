###### 1
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that the butler[^h8248] of the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] and his baker[^h644] had offended[^h2398] their lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 2
And Pharaoh[^h6547] was wroth[^h7107] against[^h5921] two[^h8147] of his officers[^h5631], against the chief[^h8269] of the butlers[^h8248], and against the chief[^h8269] of the bakers[^h644].
###### 3
And he put[^h5414] them in ward[^h4929] in the house[^h1004] of the captain[^h8269] of the guard[^h2876], into the prison[^h1004] [^h5470], the place[^h4725] where Joseph[^h3130] was bound[^h631].
###### 4
And the captain[^h8269] of the guard[^h2876] charged[^h6485] Joseph[^h3130] with them, and he served[^h8334] them: and they continued a season[^h3117] in ward[^h4929].
###### 5
And they dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472] both of them[^h8147], each man[^h376] his dream[^h2472] in one[^h259] night[^h3915], each man[^h376] according to the interpretation[^h6623] of his dream[^h2472], the butler[^h8248] and the baker[^h644] of the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], which were bound[^h631] in the prison[^h1004] [^h5470].
###### 6
And Joseph[^h3130] came in[^h935] unto them in the morning[^h1242], and looked[^h7200] upon them, and, behold, they were sad[^h2196].
###### 7
And he asked[^h7592] Pharaoh's[^h6547] officers[^h5631] that were with him in the ward[^h4929] of his lord's[^h113] house[^h1004], saying[^h559], Wherefore look[^h6440] ye so sadly[^h7451] to day[^h3117]? 
###### 8
And they said[^h559] unto him, We have dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472], and there is no interpreter[^h6622] of it. And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto them, Do not interpretations[^h6623] belong to God[^h430]? tell me[^h5608] them, I pray you.
###### 9
And the chief[^h8269] butler[^h8248] told[^h5608] his dream[^h2472] to Joseph[^h3130], and said[^h559] to him, In my dream[^h2472], behold, a vine[^h1612] was before me[^h6440];
###### 10
And in the vine[^h1612] were three[^h7969] branches[^h8299]: and it was as though it budded[^h6524], and her blossoms[^h5322] shot forth[^h5927]; and the clusters[^h811] thereof brought forth ripe[^h1310] grapes[^h6025]:
###### 11
And Pharaoh's[^h6547] cup[^h3563] was in my hand[^h3027]: and I took[^h3947] the grapes[^h6025], and pressed[^h7818] them into Pharaoh's[^h6547] cup[^h3563], and I gave[^h5414] the cup[^h3563] into Pharaoh's[^h6547] hand[^h3709].
###### 12
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto him, This is the interpretation[^h6623] of it: The three[^h7969] branches[^h8299] are three[^h7969] days[^h3117]:
###### 13
Yet[^h5750] within three[^h7969] days[^h3117] shall Pharaoh[^h6547] lift up[^h5375] thine head[^h7218], and restore[^h7725] thee unto thy place[^h3653]: and thou shalt deliver[^h5414] Pharaoh's[^h6547] cup[^h3563] into his hand[^h3027], after the former[^h7223] manner[^h4941] when thou wast his butler[^h8248]. 
###### 14
But think[^h2142] on me when it shall be well[^h3190] with thee, and shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617], I pray thee, unto me, and make mention[^h2142] of me unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and bring me[^h3318] out of this house[^h1004]: 
###### 15
For indeed I was stolen away[^h1589] out of the land[^h776] of the Hebrews[^h5680]: and here also have I done[^h6213] nothing[^h3972] that they should put[^h7760] me into the dungeon[^h953].
###### 16
When the chief[^h8269] baker[^h644] saw[^h7200] that the interpretation[^h6622] was good[^h2896], he said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], I also[^h637] was in my dream[^h2472], and, behold, I had three[^h7969] white[^h2751] baskets[^h5536] on my head[^h7218]: 
###### 17
And in the uppermost[^h5945] basket[^h5536] there was of all manner[^h3978] of bakemeats[^h4639] [^h644] for Pharaoh[^h6547]; and the birds[^h5775] did eat[^h398] them out of the basket[^h5536] upon[^h5921] my head[^h7218]. 
###### 18
And Joseph[^h3130] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], This is the interpretation[^h6623] thereof: The three[^h7969] baskets[^h5536] are three[^h7969] days[^h3117]:
###### 19
Yet within three[^h7969] days[^h3117] shall Pharaoh[^h6547] lift up[^h5375] thy head[^h7218] from off thee, and shall hang[^h8518] thee on a tree[^h6086]; and the birds[^h5775] shall eat[^h398] thy flesh[^h1320] from off thee. 
###### 20
And it came to pass the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], which was Pharaoh's[^h6547] birthday[^h3117] [^h3205], that he made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960] unto all his servants[^h5650]: and he lifted up[^h5375] the head[^h7218] of the chief[^h8269] butler[^h8248] and of the chief[^h8269] baker[^h644] among[^h8432] his servants[^h5650]. 
###### 21
And he restored[^h7725] the chief[^h8269] butler[^h8248] unto his butlership[^h4945] again[^h7725]; and he gave[^h5414] the cup[^h3563] into Pharaoh's[^h6547] hand[^h3709]:
###### 22
But he hanged[^h8518] the chief[^h8269] baker[^h644]: as Joseph[^h3130] had interpreted[^h6622] to them.
###### 23
Yet did not the chief[^h8269] butler[^h8248] remember[^h2142] Joseph[^h3130], but forgat[^h7911] him.

###### 1
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that God[^h430] did tempt[^h5254] Abraham[^h85], and said[^h559] unto him, Abraham[^h85]: and he said[^h559], Behold, here I am. 
###### 2
And he said[^h559], Take now[^h3947] thy son[^h1121], thine only[^h3173] son Isaac[^h3327], whom thou lovest[^h157], and get thee[^h3212] into the land[^h776] of Moriah[^h4179]; and offer him[^h5927] there for a burnt offering[^h5930] upon one[^h259] of the mountains[^h2022] which I will tell[^h559] thee of.
###### 3
And Abraham[^h85] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and saddled[^h2280] his ass[^h2543], and took[^h3947] two[^h8147] of his young men[^h5288] with him, and Isaac[^h3327] his son[^h1121], and clave[^h1234] the wood[^h6086] for the burnt offering[^h5930], and rose up[^h6965], and went[^h3212] unto the place[^h4725] of which God[^h430] had told[^h559] him.
###### 4
Then on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117] Abraham[^h85] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] the place[^h4725] afar off[^h7350].
###### 5
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559] unto his young men[^h5288], Abide[^h3427] ye here with the ass[^h2543]; and I and the lad[^h5288] will go[^h3212] yonder[^h3541] and worship[^h7812], and come again[^h7725] to you.
###### 6
And Abraham[^h85] took[^h3947] the wood[^h6086] of the burnt offering[^h5930], and laid[^h7760] it upon Isaac[^h3327] his son[^h1121]; and he took[^h3947] the fire[^h784] in his hand[^h3027], and a knife[^h3979]; and they went[^h3212] both[^h8147] of them together[^h3162].
###### 7
And Isaac[^h3327] spake[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85] his father[^h1], and said[^h559], My father[^h1]: and he said[^h559], Here am I, my son[^h1121]. And he said[^h559], Behold the fire[^h784] and the wood[^h6086]: but where is the lamb[^h7716] for a burnt offering[^h5930]? 
###### 8
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559], My son[^h1121], God[^h430] will provide[^h7200] himself a lamb[^h7716] for a burnt offering[^h5930]: so they went[^h3212] both of them[^h8147] together[^h3162].
###### 9
And they came[^h935] to the place[^h4725] which God[^h430] had told[^h559] him of; and Abraham[^h85] built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] there, and laid[^h6186] the wood[^h6086] in order[^h6186], and bound[^h6123] Isaac[^h3327] his son[^h1121], and laid[^h7760] him on the altar[^h4196] upon[^h4605] the wood[^h6086].
###### 10
And Abraham[^h85] stretched forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and took[^h3947] the knife[^h3979] to slay[^h7819] his son[^h1121].
###### 11
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] unto him out of heaven[^h8064], and said[^h559], Abraham[^h85], Abraham[^h85]: and he said[^h559], Here am I.
###### 12
And he said[^h559], Lay[^h7971] not thine hand[^h3027] upon[^h413] the lad[^h5288], neither do thou[^h6213] any thing[^h3972] unto him: for now[^h6258] I know[^h3045] that thou fearest[^h3373] God[^h430], seeing thou hast not[^h3808] withheld[^h2820] thy son[^h1121], thine only[^h3173] son from me.
###### 13
And Abraham[^h85] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and behold behind[^h310] him a ram[^h352] caught[^h270] in a thicket[^h5442] by his horns[^h7161]: and Abraham[^h85] went[^h3212] and took[^h3947] the ram[^h352], and offered him up[^h5927] for a burnt offering[^h5930] in the stead[^h8478] of his son[^h1121].
###### 14
And Abraham[^h85] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] Jehovahjireh[^h3070]: as[^h834] it is said[^h559] to this day[^h3117], In the mount[^h2022] of the LORD[^h3068] it shall be seen[^h7200]. 
###### 15
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] unto Abraham[^h85] out of heaven[^h8064] the second time[^h8145],
###### 16
And said[^h559], By myself have I sworn[^h7650], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], for because[^h3282] [^h834] thou hast done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], and hast not[^h3808] withheld[^h2820] thy son[^h1121], thine only[^h3173] son:
###### 17
That in blessing[^h1288] I will bless[^h1288] thee, and in multiplying[^h7235] I will multiply[^h7235] thy seed[^h2233] as the stars[^h3556] of the heaven[^h8064], and as the sand[^h2344] which is upon the sea[^h3220] shore[^h8193]; and thy seed[^h2233] shall possess[^h3423] the gate[^h8179] of his enemies[^h341]; 
###### 18
And in thy seed[^h2233] shall all the nations[^h1471] of the earth[^h776] be blessed[^h1288]; because[^h834] [^h6118] thou hast obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963].
###### 19
So Abraham[^h85] returned[^h7725] unto his young men[^h5288], and they rose up[^h6965] and went[^h3212] together[^h3162] to Beersheba[^h884]; and Abraham[^h85] dwelt[^h3427] at Beersheba[^h884].
###### 20
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that it was told[^h5046] Abraham[^h85], saying[^h559], Behold, Milcah[^h4435], she hath also born[^h3205] children[^h1121] unto thy brother[^h251] Nahor[^h5152];
###### 21
Huz[^h5780] his firstborn[^h1060], and Buz[^h938] his brother[^h251], and Kemuel[^h7055] the father[^h1] of Aram[^h758],
###### 22
And Chesed[^h3777], and Hazo[^h2375], and Pildash[^h6394], and Jidlaph[^h3044], and Bethuel[^h1328].
###### 23
And Bethuel[^h1328] begat[^h3205] Rebekah[^h7259]: these eight[^h8083] Milcah[^h4435] did bear[^h3205] to Nahor[^h5152], Abraham's[^h85] brother[^h251]. 
###### 24
And his concubine[^h6370], whose name[^h8034] was Reumah[^h7208], she bare[^h3205] also Tebah[^h2875], and Gaham[^h1514], and Thahash[^h8477], and Maachah[^h4601].

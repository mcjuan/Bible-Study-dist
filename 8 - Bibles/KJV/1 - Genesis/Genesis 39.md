###### 1
And Joseph[^h3130] was brought down[^h3381] to Egypt[^h4714]; and Potiphar[^h6318], an officer[^h5631] of Pharaoh[^h6547], captain[^h8269] of the guard[^h2876], an Egyptian[^h376] [^h4713], bought[^h7069] him of the hands[^h3027] of the Ishmeelites[^h3459], which had brought him down[^h3381] thither.
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] was with Joseph[^h3130], and he was a prosperous[^h6743] man[^h376]; and he was in the house[^h1004] of his master[^h113] the Egyptian[^h4713].
###### 3
And his master[^h113] saw[^h7200] that the LORD[^h3068] was with him, and that the LORD[^h3068] made all that he did[^h6213] to prosper[^h6743] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 4
And Joseph[^h3130] found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in his sight[^h5869], and he served[^h8334] him: and he made him overseer[^h6485] over his house[^h1004], and all that he had[^h3426] he put[^h5414] into his hand[^h3027].
###### 5
And it came to pass from the time[^h227] that he had made him overseer[^h6485] in his house[^h1004], and over all that he had[^h3426], that the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] the Egyptian's[^h4713] house[^h1004] for Joseph's[^h3130] sake[^h1558]; and the blessing[^h1293] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon all that he had[^h3426] in the house[^h1004], and in the field[^h7704].
###### 6
And he left[^h5800] all that he had in Joseph's[^h3130] hand[^h3027]; and he knew[^h3045] not ought[^h3972] he had, save[^h518] the bread[^h3899] which he did eat[^h398]. And Joseph[^h3130] was a goodly[^h8389] person, and well[^h3303] favoured[^h4758].
###### 7
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that his master's[^h113] wife[^h802] cast[^h5375] her eyes[^h5869] upon Joseph[^h3130]; and she said[^h559], Lie[^h7901] with me.
###### 8
But he refused[^h3985], and said[^h559] unto his master's[^h113] wife[^h802], Behold, my master[^h113] wotteth[^h3045] not what is with me in the house[^h1004], and he hath committed[^h5414] all that he hath[^h3426] to my hand[^h3027];
###### 9
There is none greater[^h1419] in this house[^h1004] than I; neither[^h3808] hath he kept back[^h2820] any thing[^h3972] from me but thee, because[^h834] thou[^h859] art his wife[^h802]: how then can I do[^h6213] this great[^h1419] wickedness[^h7451], and sin[^h2398] against God[^h430]?
###### 10
And it came to pass, as she spake[^h1696] to Joseph[^h3130] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117], that he hearkened[^h8085] not unto her, to lie[^h7901] by her[^h681], or to be with her.
###### 11
And it came to pass about this time[^h3117], that Joseph went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] to do[^h6213] his business[^h4399]; and there was none of the men[^h376] [^h582] of the house[^h1004] there within.
###### 12
And she caught[^h8610] him by his garment[^h899], saying[^h559], Lie[^h7901] with me: and he left[^h5800] his garment[^h899] in her hand[^h3027], and fled[^h5127], and got[^h3318] him out[^h2351].
###### 13
And it came to pass, when she saw[^h7200] that he had left[^h5800] his garment[^h899] in her hand[^h3027], and was fled[^h5127] forth[^h2351],
###### 14
That she called[^h7121] unto the men[^h582] of her house[^h1004], and spake[^h559] unto them, saying[^h559], See[^h7200], he hath brought in[^h935] an Hebrew[^h376] [^h5680] unto us to mock[^h6711] us; he came in[^h935] unto me to lie[^h7901] with me, and I cried[^h7121] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963]: 
###### 15
And it came to pass, when he heard[^h8085] that I lifted up[^h7311] my voice[^h6963] and cried[^h7121], that he left[^h5800] his garment[^h899] with me[^h681], and fled[^h5127], and got him[^h3318] out[^h2351].
###### 16
And she laid up[^h3240] his garment[^h899] by her[^h681], until his lord[^h113] came[^h935] home[^h1004].
###### 17
And she spake[^h1696] unto him according to these words[^h1697], saying[^h559], The Hebrew[^h5680] servant[^h5650], which thou hast brought[^h935] unto us, came in[^h935] unto me to mock[^h6711] me:
###### 18
And it came to pass, as I lifted up[^h7311] my voice[^h6963] and cried[^h7121], that he left[^h5800] his garment[^h899] with me[^h681], and fled[^h5127] out[^h2351].
###### 19
And it came to pass, when his master[^h113] heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of his wife[^h802], which she spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], After this manner[^h1697] did[^h6213] thy servant[^h5650] to me; that his wrath[^h639] was kindled[^h2734].
###### 20
And Joseph's[^h3130] master[^h113] took[^h3947] him, and put him[^h5414] into the prison[^h1004] [^h5470], a place[^h4725] where the king's[^h4428] prisoners[^h615] were bound[^h631]: and he was there in the prison[^h1004] [^h5470].
###### 21
But the LORD[^h3068] was with Joseph[^h3130], and shewed[^h5186] him mercy[^h2617], and gave[^h5414] him favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of the keeper[^h8269] of the prison[^h1004] [^h5470]. 
###### 22
And the keeper[^h8269] of the prison[^h1004] [^h5470] committed[^h5414] to Joseph's[^h3130] hand[^h3027] all the prisoners[^h615] that were in the prison[^h1004] [^h5470]; and whatsoever they did[^h6213] there, he was the doer[^h6213] of it.
###### 23
The keeper[^h8269] of the prison[^h1004] [^h5470] looked[^h7200] not to any thing[^h3972] that was under his hand[^h3027]; because the LORD[^h3068] was with him, and that which he did[^h6213], the LORD[^h3068] made it to prosper[^h6743].

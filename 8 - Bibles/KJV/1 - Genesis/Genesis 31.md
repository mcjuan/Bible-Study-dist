###### 1
And he heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of Laban's[^h3837] sons[^h1121], saying[^h559], Jacob[^h3290] hath taken away[^h3947] all that was our father's[^h1]; and of that which was our father's[^h1] hath he gotten[^h6213] all this glory[^h3519].
###### 2
And Jacob[^h3290] beheld[^h7200] the countenance[^h6440] of Laban[^h3837], and, behold, it was not toward him as[^h8543] before[^h8032]. 
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], Return[^h7725] unto the land[^h776] of thy fathers[^h1], and to thy kindred[^h4138]; and I will be with thee.
###### 4
And Jacob[^h3290] sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] Rachel[^h7354] and Leah[^h3812] to the field[^h7704] unto his flock[^h6629],
###### 5
And said[^h559] unto them, I see[^h7200] your father's[^h1] countenance[^h6440], that it is not toward me as[^h8543] before[^h8032]; but the God[^h430] of my father[^h1] hath been[^h1961] with me.
###### 6
And ye[^h859] know[^h3045] that with all my power[^h3581] I have served[^h5647] your father[^h1].
###### 7
And your father[^h1] hath deceived[^h2048] me, and changed[^h2498] my wages[^h4909] ten[^h6235] times[^h4489]; but God[^h430] suffered him[^h5414] not to hurt[^h7489] me[^h5978].
###### 8
If he said[^h559] thus, The speckled[^h5348] shall be thy wages[^h7939]; then all the cattle[^h6629] bare[^h3205] speckled[^h5348]: and if he said[^h559] thus, The ringstraked[^h6124] shall be thy hire[^h7939]; then bare[^h3205] all the cattle[^h6629] ringstraked[^h6124].
###### 9
Thus God[^h430] hath taken away[^h5337] the cattle[^h4735] of your father[^h1], and given[^h5414] them to me.
###### 10
And it came to pass at the time[^h6256] that the cattle[^h6629] conceived[^h3179], that I lifted up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] in a dream[^h2472], and, behold, the rams[^h6260] which leaped[^h5927] upon the cattle[^h6629] were ringstraked[^h6124], speckled[^h5348], and grisled[^h1261]. 
###### 11
And the angel[^h4397] of God[^h430] spake[^h559] unto me in a dream[^h2472], saying, Jacob[^h3290]: And I said[^h559], Here am I.
###### 12
And he said[^h559], Lift up[^h5375] now thine eyes[^h5869], and see[^h7200], all the rams[^h6260] which leap[^h5927] upon the cattle[^h6629] are ringstraked[^h6124], speckled[^h5348], and grisled[^h1261]: for I have seen[^h7200] all that Laban[^h3837] doeth[^h6213] unto thee.
###### 13
I am the God[^h410] of Bethel[^h1008], where thou anointedst[^h4886] the pillar[^h4676], and where thou vowedst[^h5087] a vow[^h5088] unto me: now arise[^h6965], get thee out[^h3318] from this land[^h776], and return[^h7725] unto the land[^h776] of thy kindred[^h4138].
###### 14
And Rachel[^h7354] and Leah[^h3812] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto him, Is there yet any portion[^h2506] or inheritance[^h5159] for us in our father's[^h1] house[^h1004]?
###### 15
Are we not counted[^h2803] of him strangers[^h5237]? for he hath sold[^h4376] us, and hath quite[^h398] devoured[^h398] also our money[^h3701].
###### 16
For all the riches[^h6239] which God[^h430] hath taken[^h5337] from our father[^h1], that is ours, and our children's[^h1121]: now then, whatsoever God[^h430] hath said[^h559] unto thee, do[^h6213].
###### 17
Then Jacob[^h3290] rose up[^h6965], and set[^h5375] his sons[^h1121] and his wives[^h802] upon camels[^h1581];
###### 18
And he carried away[^h5090] all his cattle[^h4735], and all his goods[^h7399] which he had gotten[^h7408], the cattle[^h4735] of his getting[^h7075], which he had gotten[^h7408] in Padanaram[^h6307], for to go[^h935] to Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667].
###### 19
And Laban[^h3837] went[^h1980] to shear[^h1494] his sheep[^h6629]: and Rachel[^h7354] had stolen[^h1589] the images[^h8655] that were her father's[^h1]. 
###### 20
And Jacob[^h3290] stole away[^h1589] unawares[^h3820] to Laban[^h3837] the Syrian[^h761], in that[^h5921] he told[^h5046] him not[^h1097] that he fled[^h1272]. 
###### 21
So he fled[^h1272] with all that he had; and he rose up[^h6965], and passed over[^h5674] the river[^h5104], and set[^h7760] his face[^h6440] toward the mount[^h2022] Gilead[^h1568].
###### 22
And it was told[^h5046] Laban[^h3837] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117] that Jacob[^h3290] was fled[^h1272].
###### 23
And he took[^h3947] his brethren[^h251] with him, and pursued[^h7291] after him[^h310] seven[^h7651] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870]; and they overtook[^h1692] him in the mount[^h2022] Gilead[^h1568].
###### 24
And God[^h430] came[^h935] to Laban[^h3837] the Syrian[^h761] in a dream[^h2472] by night[^h3915], and said[^h559] unto him, Take heed[^h8104] that thou speak[^h1696] not to[^h5973] Jacob[^h3290] either good[^h2896] or[^h5704] bad[^h7451]. 
###### 25
Then Laban[^h3837] overtook[^h5381] Jacob[^h3290]. Now Jacob[^h3290] had pitched[^h8628] his tent[^h168] in the mount[^h2022]: and Laban[^h3837] with his brethren[^h251] pitched[^h8628] in the mount[^h2022] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 26
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559] to Jacob[^h3290], What hast thou done[^h6213], that thou hast stolen away[^h1589] unawares[^h3824] to me, and carried away[^h5090] my daughters[^h1323], as captives[^h7617] taken with the sword[^h2719]?
###### 27
Wherefore didst thou flee away[^h1272] secretly[^h2244], and steal away[^h1589] from me; and didst not tell[^h5046] me, that I might have sent thee away[^h7971] with mirth[^h8057], and with songs[^h7892], with tabret[^h8596], and with harp[^h3658]? 
###### 28
And hast not suffered[^h5203] me to kiss[^h5401] my sons[^h1121] and my daughters[^h1323]? thou hast now done foolishly[^h5528] in so doing[^h6213].
###### 29
It is[^h3426] in the power[^h410] of my hand[^h3027] to do[^h6213] you hurt[^h7451]: but the God[^h430] of your father[^h1] spake[^h559] unto me yesternight[^h570], saying[^h559], Take thou heed[^h8104] that thou speak not[^h1696] to Jacob[^h3290] either good[^h2896] or bad[^h7451].
###### 30
And now, though thou wouldest needs[^h1980] be gone[^h1980], because thou sore[^h3700] longedst[^h3700] after thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], yet wherefore hast thou stolen[^h1589] my gods[^h430]?
###### 31
And Jacob[^h3290] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] to Laban[^h3837], Because I was afraid[^h3372]: for I said[^h559], Peradventure[^h6435] thou wouldest take by force[^h1497] thy daughters[^h1323] from me.
###### 32
With whomsoever[^h834] thou findest[^h4672] thy gods[^h430], let him not live[^h2421]: before[^h5048] our brethren[^h251] discern[^h5234] thou what is thine with me, and take[^h3947] it to thee. For Jacob[^h3290] knew[^h3045] not that Rachel[^h7354] had stolen[^h1589] them.
###### 33
And Laban[^h3837] went[^h935] into Jacob's[^h3290] tent[^h168], and into Leah's[^h3812] tent[^h168], and into the two[^h8147] maidservants'[^h519] tents[^h168]; but he found[^h4672] them not. Then went he out[^h3318] of Leah's[^h3812] tent[^h168], and entered[^h935] into Rachel's[^h7354] tent[^h168].
###### 34
Now Rachel[^h7354] had taken[^h3947] the images[^h8655], and put[^h7760] them in the camel's[^h1581] furniture[^h3733], and sat[^h3427] upon them. And Laban[^h3837] searched[^h4959] all the tent[^h168], but found[^h4672] them not. 
###### 35
And she said[^h559] to her father[^h1], Let it not displease[^h2734] [^h5869] my lord[^h113] that I cannot[^h3201] rise up[^h6965] before thee[^h6440]; for the custom[^h1870] of women[^h802] is upon me. And he searched[^h2664], but found[^h4672] not the images[^h8655].
###### 36
And Jacob[^h3290] was wroth[^h2734], and chode[^h7378] with Laban[^h3837]: and Jacob[^h3290] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] to Laban[^h3837], What is my trespass[^h6588]? what is my sin[^h2403], that thou hast so hotly pursued[^h1814] after me[^h310]?
###### 37
Whereas[^h3588] thou hast searched[^h4959] all my stuff[^h3627], what hast thou found[^h4672] of all thy household[^h1004] stuff[^h3627]? set[^h7760] it here[^h3541] before my brethren[^h251] and thy brethren[^h251], that they may judge[^h3198] betwixt[^h996] us both[^h8147]. 
###### 38
This twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] have I been with thee; thy ewes[^h7353] and thy she goats[^h5795] have not cast their young[^h7921], and the rams[^h352] of thy flock[^h6629] have I not eaten[^h398].
###### 39
That which was torn[^h2966] of beasts I brought[^h935] not unto thee; I bare the loss[^h2398] of it; of my hand[^h3027] didst thou require[^h1245] it, whether stolen[^h1589] by day[^h3117], or stolen[^h1589] by night[^h3915].
###### 40
Thus I was; in the day[^h3117] the drought[^h2721] consumed[^h398] me, and the frost[^h7140] by night[^h3915]; and my sleep[^h8142] departed[^h5074] from mine eyes[^h5869].
###### 41
Thus have I been twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] in thy house[^h1004]; I served thee[^h5647] fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] years[^h8141] for thy two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323], and six[^h8337] years[^h8141] for thy cattle[^h6629]: and thou hast changed[^h2498] my wages[^h4909] ten[^h6235] times[^h4489].
###### 42
Except[^h3884] the God[^h430] of my father[^h1], the God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], and the fear[^h6343] of Isaac[^h3327], had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away[^h7971] now empty[^h7387]. God[^h430] hath seen[^h7200] mine affliction[^h6040] and the labour[^h3018] of my hands[^h3709], and rebuked[^h3198] thee yesternight[^h570].
###### 43
And Laban[^h3837] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], These daughters[^h1323] are my daughters[^h1323], and these children[^h1121] are my children[^h1121], and these cattle[^h6629] are my cattle[^h6629], and all that thou seest[^h7200] is mine: and what can I do[^h6213] this day[^h3117] unto these my daughters[^h1323], or[^h176] unto their children[^h1121] which they have born[^h3205]?
###### 44
Now therefore come thou[^h3212], let us make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285], I and thou; and let it be for a witness[^h5707] between me and thee.
###### 45
And Jacob[^h3290] took[^h3947] a stone[^h68], and set it up[^h7311] for a pillar[^h4676].
###### 46
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], Gather[^h3950] stones[^h68]; and they took[^h3947] stones[^h68], and made[^h6213] an heap[^h1530]: and they did eat[^h398] there upon the heap[^h1530].
###### 47
And Laban[^h3837] called[^h7121] it Jegarsahadutha[^h3026]: but Jacob[^h3290] called[^h7121] it Galeed[^h1567].  
###### 48
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559], This heap[^h1530] is a witness[^h5707] between me and thee this day[^h3117]. Therefore was the name[^h8034] of it called[^h7121] Galeed[^h1567];
###### 49
And Mizpah[^h4709]; for[^h834] he said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] watch[^h6822] between me and thee, when we are absent[^h5641] one[^h376] from another[^h7453]. 
###### 50
If thou shalt afflict[^h6031] my daughters[^h1323], or if thou shalt take[^h3947] other wives[^h802] beside[^h5921] my daughters[^h1323], no man[^h376] is with us; see[^h7200], God[^h430] is witness[^h5707] betwixt me and thee.
###### 51
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559] to Jacob[^h3290], Behold this heap[^h1530], and behold this pillar[^h4676], which I have cast[^h3384] betwixt me and thee;
###### 52
This heap[^h1530] be witness[^h5707], and this pillar[^h4676] be witness[^h5713], that I will not pass over[^h5674] this heap[^h1530] to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over[^h5674] this heap[^h1530] and this pillar[^h4676] unto me, for harm[^h7451].
###### 53
The God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], and the God[^h430] of Nahor[^h5152], the God[^h430] of their father[^h1], judge[^h8199] betwixt us. And Jacob[^h3290] sware[^h7650] by the fear[^h6343] of his father[^h1] Isaac[^h3327].
###### 54
Then Jacob[^h3290] offered[^h2076] sacrifice[^h2077] upon the mount[^h2022], and called[^h7121] his brethren[^h251] to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899]: and they did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], and tarried all night[^h3885] in the mount[^h2022]. 
###### 55
And early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242] Laban[^h3837] rose up[^h7925], and kissed[^h5401] his sons[^h1121] and his daughters[^h1323], and blessed[^h1288] them: and Laban[^h3837] departed[^h3212], and returned[^h7725] unto his place[^h4725].

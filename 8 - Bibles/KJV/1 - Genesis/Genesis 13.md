###### 1
And Abram[^h87] went up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], he, and his wife[^h802], and all that he had, and Lot[^h3876] with him, into the south[^h5045].
###### 2
And Abram[^h87] was very[^h3966] rich[^h3513] in cattle[^h4735], in silver[^h3701], and in gold[^h2091].
###### 3
And he went[^h3212] on his journeys[^h4550] from the south[^h5045] even to Bethel[^h1008], unto the place[^h4725] where his tent[^h168] had been[^h1961] at the beginning[^h8462], between Bethel[^h1008] and Hai[^h5857];
###### 4
Unto the place[^h4725] of the altar[^h4196], which he had made[^h6213] there at the first[^h7223]: and there Abram[^h87] called[^h7121] on the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
And Lot[^h3876] also, which went[^h1980] with[^h854] Abram[^h87], had flocks[^h6629], and herds[^h1241], and tents[^h168].
###### 6
And the land[^h776] was not able to bear[^h5375] them, that they might dwell[^h3427] together[^h3162]: for their substance[^h7399] was great[^h7227], so that they could[^h3201] not dwell[^h3427] together[^h3162].
###### 7
And there was a strife[^h7379] between the herdmen[^h7462] of Abram's[^h87] cattle[^h4735] and the herdmen[^h7462] of Lot's[^h3876] cattle[^h4735]: and the Canaanite[^h3669] and the Perizzite[^h6522] dwelled[^h3427] then in the land[^h776].
###### 8
And Abram[^h87] said[^h559] unto Lot[^h3876], Let there be[^h1961] no[^h408] strife[^h4808], I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen[^h7462] and thy herdmen[^h7462]; for we[^h582] be brethren[^h251]. 
###### 9
Is not the whole land[^h776] before thee[^h6440]? separate thyself[^h6504], I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand[^h8040], then I will go to the right[^h3231]; or if thou depart to the right hand[^h3225], then I will go to the left[^h8041].
###### 10
And Lot[^h3876] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and beheld[^h7200] all the plain[^h3603] of Jordan[^h3383], that it was well watered[^h4945] every where, before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] destroyed[^h7843] Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017], even as the garden[^h1588] of the LORD[^h3068], like the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], as thou comest[^h935] unto Zoar[^h6820].
###### 11
Then Lot[^h3876] chose[^h977] him all the plain[^h3603] of Jordan[^h3383]; and Lot[^h3876] journeyed[^h5265] east[^h6924]: and they separated themselves[^h6504] the one[^h376] from the other[^h251].
###### 12
Abram[^h87] dwelled[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and Lot[^h3876] dwelled[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of the plain[^h3603], and pitched his tent[^h167] toward[^h5704] Sodom[^h5467].
###### 13
But the men[^h582] of Sodom[^h5467] were wicked[^h7451] and sinners[^h2400] before the LORD[^h3068] exceedingly[^h3966].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Abram[^h87], after[^h310] that Lot[^h3876] was separated[^h6504] from him, Lift up[^h5375] now thine eyes[^h5869], and look[^h7200] from the place[^h4725] where thou art northward[^h6828], and southward[^h5045], and eastward[^h6924], and westward[^h3220]:
###### 15
For all the land[^h776] which thou seest[^h7200], to thee will I give it[^h5414], and to thy seed[^h2233] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 16
And I will make[^h7760] thy seed[^h2233] as the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776]: so that[^h834] if a man[^h376] can[^h3201] number[^h4487] the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776], then shall thy seed[^h2233] also be numbered[^h4487].
###### 17
Arise[^h6965], walk[^h1980] through the land[^h776] in the length[^h753] of it and in the breadth[^h7341] of it; for I will give[^h5414] it unto thee.
###### 18
Then Abram[^h87] removed his tent[^h167], and came[^h935] and dwelt[^h3427] in the plain[^h436] of Mamre[^h4471], which is in Hebron[^h2275], and built[^h1129] there an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068].

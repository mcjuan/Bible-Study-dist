###### 1
And God[^h430] blessed[^h1288] Noah[^h5146] and his sons[^h1121], and said[^h559] unto them, Be fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235], and replenish[^h4390] the earth[^h776].
###### 2
And the fear of you[^h4172] and the dread of you[^h2844] shall be upon every beast[^h2416] of the earth[^h776], and upon every fowl[^h5775] of the air[^h8064], upon all that moveth[^h7430] upon the earth[^h127], and upon all the fishes[^h1709] of the sea[^h3220]; into your hand[^h3027] are they delivered[^h5414].
###### 3
Every moving thing[^h7431] that liveth[^h2416] shall be meat[^h402] for you; even as the green[^h3418] herb[^h6212] have I given[^h5414] you all things.
###### 4
But[^h389] flesh[^h1320] with the life[^h5315] thereof, which is the blood[^h1818] thereof, shall ye not eat[^h398].
###### 5
And surely[^h389] your blood[^h1818] of your lives[^h5315] will I require[^h1875]; at the hand[^h3027] of every beast[^h2416] will I require it[^h1875], and at the hand[^h3027] of man[^h120]; at the hand[^h3027] of every man's[^h376] brother[^h251] will I require[^h1875] the life[^h5315] of man[^h120].
###### 6
Whoso sheddeth[^h8210] man's[^h120] blood[^h1818], by man[^h120] shall his blood[^h1818] be shed[^h8210]: for in the image[^h6754] of God[^h430] made[^h6213] he man[^h120].
###### 7
And you, be ye fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235]; bring forth abundantly[^h8317] in the earth[^h776], and multiply[^h7235] therein.
###### 8
And God[^h430] spake[^h559] unto Noah[^h5146], and to his sons[^h1121] with him, saying[^h559],
###### 9
And I, behold, I establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] with you, and with your seed[^h2233] after you[^h310];
###### 10
And with every living[^h2416] creature[^h5315] that is with you, of the fowl[^h5775], of the cattle[^h929], and of every beast[^h2416] of the earth[^h776] with you; from all that go out[^h3318] of the ark[^h8392], to every beast[^h2416] of the earth[^h776].
###### 11
And I will establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] with you; neither shall all flesh[^h1320] be cut off[^h3772] any more by the waters[^h4325] of a flood[^h3999]; neither shall there any more be a flood[^h3999] to destroy[^h7843] the earth[^h776].
###### 12
And God[^h430] said[^h559], This is the token[^h226] of the covenant[^h1285] which I[^h589] make[^h5414] between me and you and every living[^h2416] creature[^h5315] that is with you, for perpetual[^h5769] generations[^h1755]:
###### 13
I do set[^h5414] my bow[^h7198] in the cloud[^h6051], and it shall be for a token[^h226] of a covenant[^h1285] between me and the earth[^h776].
###### 14
And it shall come to pass, when I bring[^h6049] a cloud[^h6051] over the earth[^h776], that the bow[^h7198] shall be seen[^h7200] in the cloud[^h6051]:
###### 15
And I will remember[^h2142] my covenant[^h1285], which is between me and you and every living[^h2416] creature[^h5315] of all flesh[^h1320]; and the waters[^h4325] shall no more[^h5750] become a flood[^h3999] to destroy[^h7843] all flesh[^h1320].
###### 16
And the bow[^h7198] shall be in the cloud[^h6051]; and I will look upon it[^h7200], that I may remember[^h2142] the everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285] between[^h996] God[^h430] and[^h996] every living[^h2416] creature[^h5315] of all flesh[^h1320] that is upon the earth[^h776].
###### 17
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Noah[^h5146], This is the token[^h226] of the covenant[^h1285], which I have established[^h6965] between me and all flesh[^h1320] that is upon the earth[^h776].
###### 18
And the sons[^h1121] of Noah[^h5146], that went forth[^h3318] of the ark[^h8392], were Shem[^h8035], and Ham[^h2526], and Japheth[^h3315]: and Ham[^h2526] [^h1931] is the father[^h1] of Canaan[^h3667]. 
###### 19
These are the three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] of Noah[^h5146]: and of them was the whole earth[^h776] overspread[^h5310].
###### 20
And Noah[^h5146] began[^h2490] to be an husbandman[^h376] [^h127], and he planted[^h5193] a vineyard[^h3754]:
###### 21
And he drank[^h8354] of the wine[^h3196], and was drunken[^h7937]; and he was uncovered[^h1540] within[^h8432] his tent[^h168].
###### 22
And Ham[^h2526], the father[^h1] of Canaan[^h3667], saw[^h7200] the nakedness[^h6172] of his father[^h1], and told[^h5046] his two[^h8147] brethren[^h251] without[^h2351].
###### 23
And Shem[^h8035] and Japheth[^h3315] took[^h3947] a garment[^h8071], and laid[^h7760] it upon both[^h8147] their shoulders[^h7926], and went[^h3212] backward[^h322], and covered[^h3680] the nakedness[^h6172] of their father[^h1]; and their faces[^h6440] were backward[^h322], and they saw[^h7200] not their father's[^h1] nakedness[^h6172].
###### 24
And Noah[^h5146] awoke[^h3364] from his wine[^h3196], and knew[^h3045] what his younger[^h6996] son[^h1121] had done[^h6213] unto him.
###### 25
And he said[^h559], Cursed[^h779] be Canaan[^h3667]; a servant[^h5650] of servants[^h5650] shall he be unto his brethren[^h251].
###### 26
And he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Shem[^h8035]; and Canaan[^h3667] shall be[^h1961] his servant[^h5650]. 
###### 27
God[^h430] shall enlarge[^h6601] Japheth[^h3315], and he shall dwell[^h7931] in the tents[^h168] of Shem[^h8035]; and Canaan[^h3667] shall be his servant[^h5650]. 
###### 28
And Noah[^h5146] lived[^h2421] after[^h310] the flood[^h3999] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and fifty[^h2572] years[^h8141].
###### 29
And all the days[^h3117] of Noah[^h5146] were nine[^h8672] hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and fifty[^h2572] years[^h8141]: and he died[^h4191].

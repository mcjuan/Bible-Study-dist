###### 1
And the famine[^h7458] was sore[^h3515] in the land[^h776].
###### 2
And it came to pass, when they had eaten up[^h3615] [^h398] the corn[^h7668] which they had brought out[^h935] of Egypt[^h4714], their father[^h1] said[^h559] unto them, Go again[^h7725], buy[^h7666] us a little[^h4592] food[^h400].
###### 3
And Judah[^h3063] spake[^h559] unto him, saying[^h559], The man[^h376] did solemnly[^h5749] protest[^h5749] unto us, saying[^h559], Ye shall not see[^h7200] my face[^h6440], except[^h1115] your brother[^h251] be with you. 
###### 4
If thou wilt[^h3426] send[^h7971] our brother[^h251] with us, we will go down[^h3381] and buy[^h7666] thee food[^h400]:
###### 5
But if thou wilt not send[^h7971] him, we will not go down[^h3381]: for the man[^h376] said[^h559] unto us, Ye shall not see[^h7200] my face[^h6440], except your brother[^h251] be with you.
###### 6
And Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Wherefore dealt ye so ill[^h7489] with me, as to tell[^h5046] the man[^h376] whether ye had yet a brother[^h251]?
###### 7
And they said[^h559], The man[^h376] asked[^h7592] us straitly[^h7592] of our state, and of our kindred[^h4138], saying[^h559], Is your father[^h1] yet alive[^h2416]? have ye[^h3426] another brother[^h251]? and we told[^h5046] him according[^h5921] to the tenor[^h6310] of these words[^h1697]: could we certainly[^h3045] know[^h3045] that he would say[^h559], Bring[^h3381] your brother[^h251] down[^h3381]?   
###### 8
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559] unto Israel[^h3478] his father[^h1], Send[^h7971] the lad[^h5288] with me, and we will arise[^h6965] and go[^h3212]; that we may live[^h2421], and not die[^h4191], both we, and thou, and also our little ones[^h2945].
###### 9
I will be surety[^h6148] for him; of my hand[^h3027] shalt thou require[^h1245] him: if[^h518] I bring[^h935] him not[^h518] unto thee, and set[^h3322] him before thee[^h6440], then let me bear the blame[^h2398] for ever[^h3117]:
###### 10
For except[^h3884] we had lingered[^h4102], surely now we had returned[^h7725] this second time[^h6471]. 
###### 11
And their father[^h1] Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto them, If it must be so now[^h645], do[^h6213] this; take[^h3947] of the best fruits[^h2173] in the land[^h776] in your vessels[^h3627], and carry down[^h3381] the man[^h376] a present[^h4503], a little[^h4592] balm[^h6875], and a little[^h4592] honey[^h1706], spices[^h5219], and myrrh[^h3910], nuts[^h992], and almonds[^h8247]:
###### 12
And take[^h3947] double[^h4932] money[^h3701] in your hand[^h3027]; and the money[^h3701] that was brought again[^h7725] in the mouth[^h6310] of your sacks[^h572], carry it again[^h7725] in your hand[^h3027]; peradventure it was an oversight[^h4870]:
###### 13
Take[^h3947] also your brother[^h251], and arise[^h6965], go again[^h7725] unto the man[^h376]:
###### 14
And God[^h410] Almighty[^h7706] give[^h5414] you mercy[^h7356] before[^h6440] the man[^h376], that he may send away[^h7971] your other[^h312] brother[^h251], and Benjamin[^h1144]. If[^h834] I be bereaved[^h7921] of my children, I am bereaved[^h7921]. 
###### 15
And the men[^h582] took[^h3947] that[^h2063] present[^h4503], and they took[^h3947] double[^h4932] money[^h3701] in their hand[^h3027], and Benjamin[^h1144]; and rose up[^h6965], and went down[^h3381] to Egypt[^h4714], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Joseph[^h3130].
###### 16
And when Joseph[^h3130] saw[^h7200] Benjamin[^h1144] with[^h854] them, he said[^h559] to the ruler of his house[^h1004], Bring[^h935] these men[^h582] home[^h1004], and slay[^h2873] [^h2874], and make ready[^h3559]; for these men[^h582] shall dine[^h398] with me at noon[^h6672].  
###### 17
And the man[^h376] did[^h6213] as Joseph[^h3130] bade[^h559]; and the man[^h376] brought[^h935] the men[^h582] into Joseph's[^h3130] house[^h1004].
###### 18
And the men[^h582] were afraid[^h3372], because they were brought[^h935] into Joseph's[^h3130] house[^h1004]; and they said[^h559], Because[^h1697] of the money[^h3701] that was returned[^h7725] in our sacks[^h572] at the first time[^h8462] are we brought in[^h935]; that he may seek occasion[^h1556] against us, and fall[^h5307] upon us, and take[^h3947] us for bondmen[^h5650], and our asses[^h2543]. 
###### 19
And they came near[^h5066] to the steward[^h376] of Joseph's[^h3130] house[^h1004], and they communed[^h1696] with him at the door[^h6607] of the house[^h1004],
###### 20
And said[^h559], O[^h994] sir[^h113], we came indeed[^h3381] down[^h3381] at the first time[^h8462] to buy[^h7666] food[^h400]: 
###### 21
And it came to pass, when we came[^h935] to the inn[^h4411], that we opened[^h6605] our sacks[^h572], and, behold, every man's[^h376] money[^h3701] was in the mouth[^h6310] of his sack[^h572], our money[^h3701] in full weight[^h4948]: and we have brought it again[^h7725] in our hand[^h3027].
###### 22
And other[^h312] money[^h3701] have we brought down[^h3381] in our hands[^h3027] to buy[^h7666] food[^h400]: we cannot tell[^h3045] who put[^h7760] our money[^h3701] in our sacks[^h572].
###### 23
And he said[^h559], Peace[^h7965] be to you, fear[^h3372] not: your God[^h430], and the God[^h430] of your father[^h1], hath given[^h5414] you treasure[^h4301] in your sacks[^h572]: I had[^h935] your money[^h3701]. And he brought[^h3318] Simeon[^h8095] out unto them. 
###### 24
And the man[^h376] brought[^h935] the men[^h582] into Joseph's[^h3130] house[^h1004], and gave[^h5414] them water[^h4325], and they washed[^h7364] their feet[^h7272]; and he gave[^h5414] their asses[^h2543] provender[^h4554].
###### 25
And they made ready[^h3559] the present[^h4503] against[^h5704] Joseph[^h3130] came[^h935] at noon[^h6672]: for they heard[^h8085] that they should eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] there.
###### 26
And when Joseph[^h3130] came[^h935] home[^h1004], they brought[^h935] him the present[^h4503] which was in their hand[^h3027] into the house[^h1004], and bowed[^h7812] themselves to him to the earth[^h776].
###### 27
And he asked[^h7592] them of their welfare[^h7965], and said[^h559], Is your father[^h1] well[^h7965], the old man[^h2205] of whom ye spake[^h559]? Is he yet alive[^h2416]?  
###### 28
And they answered[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] our father[^h1] is in good health[^h7965], he is yet alive[^h2416]. And they bowed down their heads[^h6915], and made obeisance[^h7812].
###### 29
And he lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] his brother[^h251] Benjamin[^h1144], his mother's[^h517] son[^h1121], and said[^h559], Is this your younger[^h6996] brother[^h251], of whom ye spake[^h559] unto me? And he said[^h559], God[^h430] be gracious[^h2603] unto thee, my son[^h1121].
###### 30
And Joseph[^h3130] made haste[^h4116]; for his bowels[^h7356] did yearn[^h3648] upon his brother[^h251]: and he sought[^h1245] where to weep[^h1058]; and he entered[^h935] into his chamber[^h2315], and wept[^h1058] there.
###### 31
And he washed[^h7364] his face[^h6440], and went out[^h3318], and refrained[^h662] himself, and said[^h559], Set on[^h7760] bread[^h3899].
###### 32
And they set on[^h7760] for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians[^h4713], which did eat[^h398] with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians[^h4713] might[^h3201] not eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] with the Hebrews[^h5680]; for that is an abomination[^h8441] unto the Egyptians[^h4714].
###### 33
And they sat[^h3427] before him[^h6440], the firstborn[^h1060] according to his birthright[^h1062], and the youngest[^h6810] according to his youth[^h6812]: and the men[^h582] marvelled[^h8539] one[^h376] at another[^h7453].
###### 34
And he took[^h5375] and sent messes[^h4864] unto them from before him[^h6440]: but Benjamin's[^h1144] mess[^h4864] was five[^h2568] times[^h3027] so much as[^h7235] any of theirs. And they drank[^h8354], and were merry[^h7937] with him.

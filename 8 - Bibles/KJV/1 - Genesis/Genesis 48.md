###### 1
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that one told[^h559] Joseph[^h3130], Behold, thy father[^h1] is sick[^h2470]: and he took[^h3947] with him his two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], Manasseh[^h4519] and Ephraim[^h669].
###### 2
And one told[^h5046] Jacob[^h3290], and said[^h559], Behold, thy son[^h1121] Joseph[^h3130] cometh[^h935] unto thee: and Israel[^h3478] strengthened[^h2388] himself, and sat[^h3427] upon the bed[^h4296].
###### 3
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], God[^h410] Almighty[^h7706] appeared[^h7200] unto me at Luz[^h3870] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and blessed[^h1288] me,
###### 4
And said[^h559] unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235] thee, and I will make[^h5414] of thee a multitude[^h6951] of people[^h5971]; and will give[^h5414] this land[^h776] to thy seed[^h2233] after thee[^h310] for an everlasting[^h5769] possession[^h272].
###### 5
And now thy two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], Ephraim[^h669] and Manasseh[^h4519], which were born[^h3205] unto thee in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] before[^h5704] I came[^h935] unto thee into Egypt[^h4714], are mine; as Reuben[^h7205] and Simeon[^h8095], they shall be mine.
###### 6
And thy issue[^h4138], which thou begettest[^h3205] after[^h310] them, shall be thine, and shall be called[^h7121] after[^h5921] the name[^h8034] of their brethren[^h251] in their inheritance[^h5159].
###### 7
And as for me, when I came[^h935] from Padan[^h6307], Rachel[^h7354] died[^h4191] by me in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] in the way[^h1870], when[^h5750] yet there was but a little[^h3530] way[^h776] to come[^h935] unto Ephrath[^h672]: and I buried her[^h6912] there in the way[^h1870] of Ephrath[^h672]; the same is Bethlehem[^h1035].
###### 8
And Israel[^h3478] beheld[^h7200] Joseph's[^h3130] sons[^h1121], and said[^h559], Who are these?
###### 9
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], They are my sons[^h1121], whom God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] me in this place. And he said[^h559], Bring them[^h3947], I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless[^h1288] them.
###### 10
Now the eyes[^h5869] of Israel[^h3478] were dim[^h3513] for age[^h2207], so that he could[^h3201] not see[^h7200]. And he brought them near[^h5066] unto him; and he kissed[^h5401] them, and embraced[^h2263] them. 
###### 11
And Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], I had not thought[^h6419] to see[^h7200] thy face[^h6440]: and, lo, God[^h430] hath shewed[^h7200] me also thy seed[^h2233].
###### 12
And Joseph[^h3130] brought them out[^h3318] from between[^h5973] his knees[^h1290], and he bowed[^h7812] himself with his face[^h639] to the earth[^h776].
###### 13
And Joseph[^h3130] took[^h3947] them both[^h8147], Ephraim[^h669] in his right hand[^h3225] toward Israel's[^h3478] left hand[^h8040], and Manasseh[^h4519] in his left hand[^h8040] toward Israel's[^h3478] right hand[^h3225], and brought them near[^h5066] unto him.
###### 14
And Israel[^h3478] stretched out[^h7971] his right hand[^h3225], and laid[^h7896] it upon Ephraim's[^h669] head[^h7218], who was the younger[^h6810], and his left hand[^h8040] upon Manasseh's[^h4519] head[^h7218], guiding[^h7919] his hands[^h3027] wittingly[^h7919]; for Manasseh[^h4519] was the firstborn[^h1060].
###### 15
And he blessed[^h1288] Joseph[^h3130], and said[^h559], God[^h430], before[^h6440] whom my fathers[^h1] Abraham[^h85] and Isaac[^h3327] did walk[^h1980], the God[^h430] which fed[^h7462] me all my life long[^h5750] unto this day[^h3117],
###### 16
The Angel[^h4397] which redeemed[^h1350] me from all evil[^h7451], bless[^h1288] the lads[^h5288]; and let my name[^h8034] be named[^h7121] on them, and the name[^h8034] of my fathers[^h1] Abraham[^h85] and Isaac[^h3327]; and let them grow[^h1711] into a multitude[^h7230] in the midst[^h7130] of the earth[^h776]. 
###### 17
And when Joseph[^h3130] saw[^h7200] that his father[^h1] laid[^h7896] his right[^h3225] hand[^h3027] upon the head[^h7218] of Ephraim[^h669], it displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] him: and he held up[^h8551] his father's[^h1] hand[^h3027], to remove[^h5493] it from Ephraim's[^h669] head[^h7218] unto Manasseh's[^h4519] head[^h7218]. 
###### 18
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], Not so, my father[^h1]: for this is the firstborn[^h1060]; put[^h7760] thy right hand[^h3225] upon his head[^h7218].
###### 19
And his father[^h1] refused[^h3985], and said[^h559], I know[^h3045] it, my son[^h1121], I know[^h3045] it: he also shall become a people[^h5971], and he also shall be great[^h1431]: but truly[^h199] his younger[^h6996] brother[^h251] shall be greater[^h1431] than he, and his seed[^h2233] shall become a multitude[^h4393] of nations[^h1471]. 
###### 20
And he blessed[^h1288] them that day[^h3117], saying[^h559], In thee shall Israel[^h3478] bless[^h1288], saying[^h559], God[^h430] make[^h7760] thee as Ephraim[^h669] and as Manasseh[^h4519]: and he set[^h7760] Ephraim[^h669] before[^h6440] Manasseh[^h4519].
###### 21
And Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], Behold, I die[^h4191]: but God[^h430] shall be with you, and bring you again[^h7725] unto the land[^h776] of your fathers[^h1].
###### 22
Moreover I have given[^h5414] to thee one[^h259] portion[^h7926] above thy brethren[^h251], which I took[^h3947] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Amorite[^h567] with my sword[^h2719] and with my bow[^h7198].

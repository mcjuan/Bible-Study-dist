###### 1
And Abraham[^h85] was old[^h2204], and well stricken[^h935] in age[^h3117]: and the LORD[^h3068] had blessed[^h1288] Abraham[^h85] in all things. 
###### 2
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559] unto his eldest[^h2205] servant[^h5650] of his house[^h1004], that ruled over[^h4910] all that he had, Put[^h7760], I pray thee, thy hand[^h3027] under my thigh[^h3409]:
###### 3
And I will make thee swear[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064], and the God[^h430] of the earth[^h776], that thou shalt not take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] unto my son[^h1121] of the daughters[^h1323] of the Canaanites[^h3669], among[^h7130] whom I dwell[^h3427]:
###### 4
But thou shalt go[^h3212] unto my country[^h776], and to my kindred[^h4138], and take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] unto my son[^h1121] Isaac[^h3327].
###### 5
And the servant[^h5650] said[^h559] unto him, Peradventure the woman[^h802] will not be willing[^h14] to follow[^h3212] me[^h310] unto this land[^h776]: must I needs bring[^h7725] thy son[^h1121] again[^h7725] unto the land[^h776] from whence thou camest[^h3318]?
###### 6
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559] unto him, Beware[^h8104] thou that thou bring[^h7725] not[^h6435] my son[^h1121] thither again[^h7725].
###### 7
The LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064], which took me[^h3947] from my father's[^h1] house[^h1004], and from the land[^h776] of my kindred[^h4138], and which spake[^h1696] unto me, and that sware[^h7650] unto me, saying[^h559], Unto thy seed[^h2233] will I give[^h5414] this land[^h776]; he shall send[^h7971] his angel[^h4397] before thee[^h6440], and thou shalt take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] unto my son[^h1121] from thence.
###### 8
And if the woman[^h802] will not be willing[^h14] to follow[^h3212] thee[^h310], then thou shalt be clear[^h5352] from this my oath[^h7621]: only bring[^h7725] not my son[^h1121] thither again[^h7725].
###### 9
And the servant[^h5650] put[^h7760] his hand[^h3027] under the thigh[^h3409] of Abraham[^h85] his master[^h113], and sware[^h7650] to him concerning[^h5921] that[^h2088] matter[^h1697].
###### 10
And the servant[^h5650] took[^h3947] ten[^h6235] camels[^h1581] of the camels[^h1581] of his master[^h113], and departed[^h3212]; for all the goods[^h2898] of his master[^h113] were in his hand[^h3027]: and he arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to Mesopotamia[^h763], unto the city[^h5892] of Nahor[^h5152]. 
###### 11
And he made[^h1288] his camels[^h1581] to kneel down[^h1288] without[^h2351] the city[^h5892] by[^h413] a well[^h875] of water[^h4325] at the time[^h6256] of the evening[^h6153], even the time[^h6256] that women go out[^h3318] to draw[^h7579] water. 
###### 12
And he said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of my master[^h113] Abraham[^h85], I pray thee, send me[^h6440] good speed[^h7136] this day[^h3117], and shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto[^h5973] my master[^h113] Abraham[^h85].
###### 13
Behold, I stand[^h5324] here by the well[^h5869] of water[^h4325]; and the daughters[^h1323] of the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] come out[^h3318] to draw[^h7579] water[^h4325]:
###### 14
And let it come to pass, that the damsel[^h5291] to whom I shall say[^h559], Let down[^h5186] thy pitcher[^h3537], I pray thee, that I may drink[^h8354]; and she shall say[^h559], Drink[^h8354], and I will give[^h8248] thy camels[^h1581] drink[^h8248] also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed[^h3198] for thy servant[^h5650] Isaac[^h3327]; and thereby shall I know[^h3045] that thou hast shewed[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto my master[^h113].
###### 15
And it came to pass, before he had done[^h3615] speaking[^h1696], that, behold, Rebekah[^h7259] came out[^h3318], who[^h834] was born[^h3205] to Bethuel[^h1328], son[^h1121] of Milcah[^h4435], the wife[^h802] of Nahor[^h5152], Abraham's[^h85] brother[^h251], with her pitcher[^h3537] upon her shoulder[^h7926].
###### 16
And the damsel[^h5291] was very[^h3966] fair[^h2896] to look upon[^h4758], a virgin[^h1330], neither had any man[^h376] known[^h3045] her: and she went down[^h3381] to the well[^h5869], and filled[^h4390] her pitcher[^h3537], and came up[^h5927]. 
###### 17
And the servant[^h5650] ran[^h7323] to meet her[^h7125], and said[^h559], Let me, I pray thee, drink[^h1572] a little[^h4592] water[^h4325] of thy pitcher[^h3537].
###### 18
And she said[^h559], Drink[^h8354], my lord[^h113]: and she hasted[^h4116], and let down[^h3381] her pitcher[^h3537] upon her hand[^h3027], and gave him drink[^h8248].
###### 19
And when she had done[^h3615] giving him drink[^h8248], she said[^h559], I will draw[^h7579] water for thy camels[^h1581] also, until they have done[^h3615] drinking[^h8354].
###### 20
And she hasted[^h4116], and emptied[^h6168] her pitcher[^h3537] into the trough[^h8268], and ran[^h7323] again unto the well[^h875] to draw[^h7579] water, and drew[^h7579] for all his camels[^h1581].
###### 21
And the man[^h376] wondering[^h7583] at her held his peace[^h2790], to wit[^h3045] whether the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h6743] his journey[^h1870] prosperous[^h6743] or[^h518] not.
###### 22
And it came to pass, as the camels[^h1581] had done[^h3615] drinking[^h8354], that the man[^h376] took[^h3947] a golden[^h2091] earring[^h5141] of half a shekel[^h1235] weight[^h4948], and two[^h8147] bracelets[^h6781] for her hands[^h3027] of ten[^h6235] shekels weight[^h4948] of gold[^h2091]; 
###### 23
And said[^h559], Whose[^h4310] daughter[^h1323] art thou[^h859]? tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee: is there[^h3426] room[^h4725] in thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004] for us to lodge in[^h3885]?
###### 24
And she said[^h559] unto him, I am the daughter[^h1323] of Bethuel[^h1328] the son[^h1121] of Milcah[^h4435], which she bare[^h3205] unto Nahor[^h5152].
###### 25
She said[^h559] moreover unto him, We have both[^h1571] straw[^h8401] and provender[^h4554] enough[^h7227], and[^h1571] room[^h4725] to lodge in[^h3885].
###### 26
And the man[^h376] bowed down his head[^h6915], and worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 27
And he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of my master[^h113] Abraham[^h85], who hath not left destitute[^h5800] [^h5973] my master[^h113] of his mercy[^h2617] and his truth[^h571]: I being in the way[^h1870], the LORD[^h3068] led me[^h5148] to the house[^h1004] of my master's[^h113] brethren[^h251].
###### 28
And the damsel[^h5291] ran[^h7323], and told[^h5046] them of her mother's[^h517] house[^h1004] these things[^h1697].
###### 29
And Rebekah[^h7259] had a brother[^h251], and his name[^h8034] was Laban[^h3837]: and Laban[^h3837] ran[^h7323] out[^h2351] unto the man[^h376], unto the well[^h5869].
###### 30
And it came to pass, when he saw[^h7200] the earring[^h5141] and bracelets[^h6781] upon his sister's[^h269] hands[^h3027], and when he heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of Rebekah[^h7259] his sister[^h269], saying[^h559], Thus[^h3541] spake[^h1696] the man[^h376] unto me; that he came[^h935] unto the man[^h376]; and, behold, he stood[^h5975] by[^h5921] the camels[^h1581] at the well[^h5869].
###### 31
And he said[^h559], Come in[^h935], thou blessed[^h1288] of the LORD[^h3068]; wherefore standest[^h5975] thou without[^h2351]? for I have prepared[^h6437] the house[^h1004], and room[^h4725] for the camels[^h1581].
###### 32
And the man[^h376] came[^h935] into the house[^h1004]: and he ungirded[^h6605] his camels[^h1581], and gave[^h5414] straw[^h8401] and provender[^h4554] for the camels[^h1581], and water[^h4325] to wash[^h7364] his feet[^h7272], and the men's[^h582] feet[^h7272] that were with him.
###### 33
And there was set[^h7760] [^h3455] meat before him[^h6440] to eat[^h398]: but he said[^h559], I will not eat[^h398], until I have told[^h1696] mine errand[^h1697]. And he said[^h559], Speak on[^h1696].
###### 34
And he said[^h559], I am Abraham's[^h85] servant[^h5650].
###### 35
And the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] my master[^h113] greatly[^h3966]; and he is become great[^h1431]: and he hath given[^h5414] him flocks[^h6629], and herds[^h1241], and silver[^h3701], and gold[^h2091], and menservants[^h5650], and maidservants[^h8198], and camels[^h1581], and asses[^h2543].
###### 36
And Sarah[^h8283] my master's[^h113] wife[^h802] bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121] to my master[^h113] when[^h310] she was old[^h2209]: and unto him hath he given[^h5414] all that he hath.
###### 37
And my master[^h113] made me swear[^h7650], saying[^h559], Thou shalt not take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] to my son[^h1121] of the daughters[^h1323] of the Canaanites[^h3669], in whose land[^h776] I dwell[^h3427]:
###### 38
But[^h518] thou shalt go[^h3212] unto my father's[^h1] house[^h1004], and to my kindred[^h4940], and take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] unto my son[^h1121].
###### 39
And I said[^h559] unto my master[^h113], Peradventure the woman[^h802] will not follow[^h3212] [^h310] me.
###### 40
And he said[^h559] unto me, The LORD[^h3068], before[^h6440] whom I walk[^h1980], will send[^h7971] his angel[^h4397] with thee, and prosper[^h6743] thy way[^h1870]; and thou shalt take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] for my son[^h1121] of my kindred[^h4940], and of my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]:
###### 41
Then shalt thou be clear[^h5352] from this my oath[^h423], when thou comest[^h935] to my kindred[^h4940]; and if they give[^h5414] not thee one, thou shalt be clear[^h5355] from my oath[^h423].
###### 42
And I came[^h935] this day[^h3117] unto the well[^h5869], and said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of my master[^h113] Abraham[^h85], if now thou do[^h3426] prosper[^h6743] my way[^h1870] which I go[^h1980]:
###### 43
Behold, I stand[^h5324] by the well[^h5869] of water[^h4325]; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin[^h5959] cometh forth[^h3318] to draw[^h7579] water, and I say[^h559] to her, Give me[^h8248], I pray thee, a little[^h4592] water[^h4325] of thy pitcher[^h3537] to drink[^h8248];
###### 44
And she say[^h559] to me, Both drink[^h8354] thou, and I will also draw[^h7579] for thy camels[^h1581]: let the same be the woman[^h802] whom the LORD[^h3068] hath appointed out[^h3198] for my master's[^h113] son[^h1121].
###### 45
And before I had done[^h3615] speaking[^h1696] in mine heart[^h3820], behold, Rebekah[^h7259] came forth[^h3318] with her pitcher[^h3537] on her shoulder[^h7926]; and she went down[^h3381] unto the well[^h5869], and drew[^h7579] water: and I said[^h559] unto her, Let me drink[^h8248], I pray thee.
###### 46
And she made haste[^h4116], and let down[^h3381] her pitcher[^h3537] from her shoulder, and said[^h559], Drink[^h8354], and I will give[^h8248] thy camels[^h1581] drink[^h8248] also: so I drank[^h8354], and she made[^h8248] the camels[^h1581] drink[^h8248] also.
###### 47
And I asked[^h7592] her, and said[^h559], Whose daughter[^h1323] art thou? And she said[^h559], The daughter[^h1323] of Bethuel[^h1328], Nahor's[^h5152] son[^h1121], whom Milcah[^h4435] bare[^h3205] unto him: and I put[^h7760] the earring[^h5141] upon her face[^h639], and the bracelets[^h6781] upon her hands[^h3027].
###### 48
And I bowed down my head[^h6915], and worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068], and blessed[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of my master[^h113] Abraham[^h85], which had led me[^h5148] in the right[^h571] way[^h1870] to take[^h3947] my master's[^h113] brother's[^h251] daughter[^h1323] unto his son[^h1121].
###### 49
And now if ye will[^h3426] deal[^h6213] kindly[^h2617] and truly[^h571] with my master[^h113], tell[^h5046] me: and if not, tell[^h5046] me; that I may turn[^h6437] to the right hand[^h3225], or[^h176] to the left[^h8040].
###### 50
Then Laban[^h3837] and Bethuel[^h1328] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], The thing[^h1697] proceedeth[^h3318] from the LORD[^h3068]: we cannot[^h3201] speak[^h1696] unto thee bad[^h7451] or[^h176] good[^h2896].
###### 51
Behold, Rebekah[^h7259] is before thee[^h6440], take[^h3947] her, and go[^h3212], and let her be thy master's[^h113] son's[^h1121] wife[^h802], as the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696].
###### 52
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's[^h85] servant[^h5650] heard[^h8085] their words[^h1697], he worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068], bowing himself to the earth[^h776].
###### 53
And the servant[^h5650] brought forth[^h3318] jewels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], and jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], and raiment[^h899], and gave[^h5414] them to Rebekah[^h7259]: he gave[^h5414] also to her brother[^h251] and to her mother[^h517] precious things[^h4030]. 
###### 54
And they did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], he and the men[^h582] that were with him, and tarried all night[^h3885]; and they rose up[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242], and he said[^h559], Send me away[^h7971] unto my master[^h113].
###### 55
And her brother[^h251] and her mother[^h517] said[^h559], Let the damsel[^h5291] abide[^h3427] with us a few days[^h3117], at the least[^h176] ten[^h6218]; after[^h310] that she shall go[^h3212]. 
###### 56
And he said[^h559] unto them, Hinder me[^h309] not, seeing the LORD[^h3068] hath prospered[^h6743] my way[^h1870]; send me away[^h7971] that I may go[^h3212] to my master[^h113].
###### 57
And they said[^h559], We will call[^h7121] the damsel[^h5291], and enquire[^h7592] at her mouth[^h6310].
###### 58
And they called[^h7121] Rebekah[^h7259], and said[^h559] unto her, Wilt thou go[^h3212] with this man[^h376]? And she said[^h559], I will go[^h3212].
###### 59
And they sent away[^h7971] Rebekah[^h7259] their sister[^h269], and her nurse[^h3243], and Abraham's[^h85] servant[^h5650], and his men[^h582].
###### 60
And they blessed[^h1288] Rebekah[^h7259], and said[^h559] unto her, Thou[^h859] art our sister[^h269], be thou[^h1961] the mother of thousands[^h505] of millions[^h7233], and let thy seed[^h2233] possess[^h3423] the gate[^h8179] of those which hate[^h8130] them.
###### 61
And Rebekah[^h7259] arose[^h6965], and her damsels[^h5291], and they rode[^h7392] upon the camels[^h1581], and followed[^h3212] [^h310] the man[^h376]: and the servant[^h5650] took[^h3947] Rebekah[^h7259], and went his way[^h3212].
###### 62
And Isaac[^h3327] came[^h935] from the way[^h935] of the well Lahairoi[^h883]; for he dwelt[^h3427] in the south[^h5045] country[^h776].
###### 63
And Isaac[^h3327] went out[^h3318] to meditate[^h7742] in the field[^h7704] at[^h6437] the eventide[^h6153]: and he lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200], and, behold, the camels[^h1581] were coming[^h935]. 
###### 64
And Rebekah[^h7259] lifted up[^h5375] her eyes[^h5869], and when she saw[^h7200] Isaac[^h3327], she lighted[^h5307] off[^h5921] the camel[^h1581].
###### 65
For she had said[^h559] unto the servant[^h5650], What[^h4310] man[^h376] is this[^h1976] that walketh[^h1980] in the field[^h7704] to meet us[^h7125]? And the servant[^h5650] had said[^h559], It is my master[^h113]: therefore she took[^h3947] a vail[^h6809], and covered herself[^h3680].
###### 66
And the servant[^h5650] told[^h5608] Isaac[^h3327] all things[^h1697] that he had done[^h6213].
###### 67
And Isaac[^h3327] brought her[^h935] into his mother[^h517] Sarah's[^h8283] tent[^h168], and took[^h3947] Rebekah[^h7259], and she became his wife[^h802]; and he loved[^h157] her: and Isaac[^h3327] was comforted[^h5162] after[^h310] his mother's[^h517] death.

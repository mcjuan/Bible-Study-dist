###### 1
And it came to pass in the days[^h3117] of Amraphel[^h569] king[^h4428] of Shinar[^h8152], Arioch[^h746] king[^h4428] of Ellasar[^h495], Chedorlaomer[^h3540] king[^h4428] of Elam[^h5867], and Tidal[^h8413] king[^h4428] of nations[^h1471];
###### 2
That these made[^h6213] war[^h4421] with[^h854] Bera[^h1298] king[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467], and with Birsha[^h1306] king[^h4428] of Gomorrah[^h6017], Shinab[^h8134] king[^h4428] of Admah[^h126], and Shemeber[^h8038] king[^h4428] of Zeboiim[^h6636], and the king[^h4428] of Bela[^h1106], which is[^h1931] Zoar[^h6820].
###### 3
All these were joined together[^h2266] in the vale[^h6010] of Siddim[^h7708], which[^h1931] is the salt[^h4417] sea[^h3220].
###### 4
Twelve[^h6240] [^h8147] years[^h8141] they served[^h5647] [^h853] Chedorlaomer[^h3540], and in the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] year[^h8141] they rebelled[^h4775].
###### 5
And in the fourteenth[^h6240] [^h702] year[^h8141] came[^h935] Chedorlaomer[^h3540], and the kings[^h4428] that were with him, and smote[^h5221] the Rephaims[^h7497] in Ashteroth Karnaim[^h6255], and the Zuzims[^h2104] in Ham[^h1990], and the Emims[^h368] in Shaveh Kiriathaim[^h7741], 
###### 6
And the Horites[^h2752] in their mount[^h2042] Seir[^h8165], unto Elparan[^h364], which is by[^h5921] the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 7
And they returned[^h7725], and came[^h935] to[^h413] Enmishpat[^h5880], which is Kadesh[^h6946], and smote[^h5221] all the country[^h7704] of the Amalekites[^h6003], and also the Amorites[^h567], that dwelt[^h3427] in Hazezontamar[^h2688].
###### 8
And there went out[^h3318] the king[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467], and the king[^h4428] of Gomorrah[^h6017], and the king[^h4428] of Admah[^h126], and the king[^h4428] of Zeboiim[^h6636], and the king[^h4428] of Bela[^h1106] (the same[^h1931] is Zoar[^h6820];) and they joined[^h6186] battle[^h4421] with them in the vale[^h6010] of Siddim[^h7708];
###### 9
With Chedorlaomer[^h3540] the king[^h4428] of Elam[^h5867], and with Tidal[^h8413] king[^h4428] of nations[^h1471], and Amraphel[^h569] king[^h4428] of Shinar[^h8152], and Arioch[^h746] king[^h4428] of Ellasar[^h495]; four[^h702] kings[^h4428] with five[^h2568].
###### 10
And the vale[^h6010] of Siddim[^h7708] was full of [^h875] slimepits[^h875] [^h2564]; and the kings[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017] fled[^h5127], and fell[^h5307] there; and they that remained[^h7604] fled[^h5127] to the mountain[^h2022].
###### 11
And they took[^h3947] all the goods[^h7399] of Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017], and all their victuals[^h400], and went their way[^h3212].
###### 12
And they took[^h3947] Lot[^h3876], Abram's[^h87] brother's[^h251] son[^h1121], who dwelt[^h3427] in Sodom[^h5467], and his goods[^h7399], and departed[^h3212].
###### 13
And there came[^h935] one that had escaped[^h6412], and told[^h5046] Abram[^h87] the Hebrew[^h5680]; for he dwelt[^h7931] in the plain[^h436] of Mamre[^h4471] the Amorite[^h567], brother[^h251] of Eshcol[^h812], and brother[^h251] of Aner[^h6063]: and these were confederate[^h1167] [^h1285] with Abram[^h87].
###### 14
And when Abram[^h87] heard[^h8085] that his brother[^h251] was taken captive[^h7617], he armed[^h7324] his trained[^h2593] servants, born[^h3211] in his own house[^h1004], three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] and eighteen[^h6240] [^h8083], and pursued[^h7291] them unto Dan[^h1835].  
###### 15
And he divided[^h2505] himself against them, he and his servants[^h5650], by night[^h3915], and smote[^h5221] them, and pursued[^h7291] them unto Hobah[^h2327], which is on the left hand[^h8040] of Damascus[^h1834].
###### 16
And he brought back[^h7725] all the goods[^h7399], and also brought again[^h7725] his brother[^h251] Lot[^h3876], and his goods[^h7399], and the women[^h802] also, and the people[^h5971].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him after[^h310] his return[^h7725] from the slaughter[^h5221] of Chedorlaomer[^h3540], and of the kings[^h4428] that were with him, at the valley[^h6010] of Shaveh[^h7740], which[^h1931] is the king's[^h4428] dale[^h6010].
###### 18
And Melchizedek[^h4442] king[^h4428] of Salem[^h8004] brought forth[^h3318] bread[^h3899] and wine[^h3196]: and he was the priest[^h3548] of the most high[^h5945] God[^h410].
###### 19
And he blessed[^h1288] him, and said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be Abram[^h87] of the most high[^h5945] God[^h410], possessor[^h7069] of heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776]:
###### 20
And blessed[^h1288] be the most high[^h5945] God[^h410], which hath delivered[^h4042] thine enemies[^h6862] into thy hand[^h3027]. And he gave[^h5414] him tithes[^h4643] of all.
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467] said[^h559] unto Abram[^h87], Give[^h5414] me the persons[^h5315], and take[^h3947] the goods[^h7399] to thyself. 
###### 22
And Abram[^h87] said[^h559] to the king[^h4428] of Sodom[^h5467], I have lift up[^h7311] mine hand[^h3027] unto the LORD[^h3068], the most high[^h5945] God[^h410], the possessor[^h7069] of heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776],
###### 23
That I will not[^h518] take from a thread[^h2339] even to a shoelatchet[^h5275] [^h8288], and that I will not[^h518] take[^h3947] any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say[^h559], I have made[^h6238] Abram[^h87] rich[^h6238]:
###### 24
Save[^h1107] only that which[^h834] the young men[^h5288] have eaten[^h398], and the portion[^h2506] of the men[^h582] which went[^h1980] with[^h854] me, Aner[^h6063], Eshcol[^h812], and Mamre[^h4471]; let them[^h1992] take[^h3947] their portion[^h2506].

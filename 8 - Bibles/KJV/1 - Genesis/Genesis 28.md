###### 1
And Isaac[^h3327] called[^h7121] Jacob[^h3290], and blessed[^h1288] him, and charged[^h6680] him, and said[^h559] unto him, Thou shalt not take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] of the daughters[^h1323] of Canaan[^h3667].
###### 2
Arise[^h6965], go[^h3212] to Padanaram[^h6307], to the house[^h1004] of Bethuel[^h1328] thy mother's[^h517] father[^h1]; and take[^h3947] thee a wife[^h802] from thence of the daughters[^h1323] of Laban[^h3837] thy mother's[^h517] brother[^h251].
###### 3
And God[^h410] Almighty[^h7706] bless[^h1288] thee, and make thee fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235] thee, that thou mayest be a multitude[^h6951] of people[^h5971]; 
###### 4
And give[^h5414] thee the blessing[^h1293] of Abraham[^h85], to thee, and to thy seed[^h2233] with thee; that thou mayest inherit[^h3423] the land[^h776] wherein thou art a stranger[^h4033], which God[^h430] gave[^h5414] unto Abraham[^h85]. 
###### 5
And Isaac[^h3327] sent away[^h7971] Jacob[^h3290]: and he went[^h3212] to Padanaram[^h6307] unto Laban[^h3837], son[^h1121] of Bethuel[^h1328] the Syrian[^h761], the brother[^h251] of Rebekah[^h7259], Jacob's[^h3290] and Esau's[^h6215] mother[^h517].
###### 6
When Esau[^h6215] saw[^h7200] that Isaac[^h3327] had blessed[^h1288] Jacob[^h3290], and sent him away[^h7971] to Padanaram[^h6307], to take[^h3947] him a wife[^h802] from thence; and that as he blessed[^h1288] him he gave him a charge[^h6680], saying[^h559], Thou shalt not take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] of the daughters[^h1323] of Canaan[^h3667];
###### 7
And that Jacob[^h3290] obeyed[^h8085] his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517], and was gone[^h3212] to Padanaram[^h6307];
###### 8
And Esau[^h6215] seeing[^h7200] that the daughters[^h1323] of Canaan[^h3667] pleased[^h5869] not[^h7451] Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1]; 
###### 9
Then went[^h3212] Esau[^h6215] unto Ishmael[^h3458], and took[^h3947] unto the wives[^h802] which he had Mahalath[^h4258] the daughter[^h1323] of Ishmael[^h3458] Abraham's[^h85] son[^h1121], the sister[^h269] of Nebajoth[^h5032], to be his wife[^h802]. 
###### 10
And Jacob[^h3290] went out[^h3318] from Beersheba[^h884], and went[^h3212] toward Haran[^h2771]. 
###### 11
And he lighted[^h6293] upon a certain place[^h4725], and tarried there all night[^h3885], because the sun[^h8121] was set[^h935]; and he took[^h3947] of the stones[^h68] of that place[^h4725], and put[^h7760] them for his pillows[^h4763], and lay down[^h7901] in that place[^h4725] to sleep[^h7901].
###### 12
And he dreamed[^h2492], and behold a ladder[^h5551] set up[^h5324] on the earth[^h776], and the top of it[^h7218] reached[^h5060] to heaven[^h8064]: and behold the angels[^h4397] of God[^h430] ascending[^h5927] and descending[^h3381] on it.
###### 13
And, behold, the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h5324] above it, and said[^h559], I am the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85] thy father[^h1], and the God[^h430] of Isaac[^h3327]: the land[^h776] whereon thou liest[^h7901], to thee will I give it[^h5414], and to thy seed[^h2233];
###### 14
And thy seed[^h2233] shall be as the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776], and thou shalt spread abroad[^h6555] to the west[^h3220], and to the east[^h6924], and to the north[^h6828], and to the south[^h5045]: and in thee and in thy seed[^h2233] shall all the families[^h4940] of the earth[^h127] be blessed[^h1288]. 
###### 15
And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep[^h8104] thee in all places whither[^h834] thou goest[^h3212], and will bring thee again[^h7725] into this land[^h127]; for I will not leave[^h5800] thee, until[^h834] I have done[^h6213] that which I have spoken[^h1696] to thee of.
###### 16
And Jacob[^h3290] awaked[^h3364] out of his sleep[^h8142], and he said[^h559], Surely[^h403] the LORD[^h3068] is[^h3426] in this place[^h4725]; and I knew[^h3045] it not.
###### 17
And he was afraid[^h3372], and said[^h559], How dreadful[^h3372] is this place[^h4725]! this is none other but the house[^h1004] of God[^h430], and this is the gate[^h8179] of heaven[^h8064].
###### 18
And Jacob[^h3290] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and took[^h3947] the stone[^h68] that he had put[^h7760] for his pillows[^h4763], and set it up[^h7760] for a pillar[^h4676], and poured[^h3332] oil[^h8081] upon the top of it[^h7218].
###### 19
And he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] Bethel[^h1008]: but[^h199] the name[^h8034] of that city[^h5892] was called Luz[^h3870] at the first[^h7223]. 
###### 20
And Jacob[^h3290] vowed[^h5087] a vow[^h5088], saying[^h559], If God[^h430] will be with me, and will keep me[^h8104] in this way[^h1870] that I go[^h1980], and will give[^h5414] me bread[^h3899] to eat[^h398], and raiment[^h899] to put on[^h3847],
###### 21
So that I come again[^h7725] to my father's[^h1] house[^h1004] in peace[^h7965]; then shall the LORD[^h3068] be my God[^h430]:
###### 22
And this stone[^h68], which I have set[^h7760] for a pillar[^h4676], shall be God's[^h430] house[^h1004]: and of all that thou shalt give[^h5414] me I will surely[^h6237] give the tenth[^h6237] unto thee.

###### 1
Then again[^h3254] Abraham[^h85] took[^h3947] a wife[^h802], and her name[^h8034] was Keturah[^h6989].
###### 2
And she bare[^h3205] him Zimran[^h2175], and Jokshan[^h3370], and Medan[^h4091], and Midian[^h4080], and Ishbak[^h3435], and Shuah[^h7744].
###### 3
And Jokshan[^h3370] begat[^h3205] Sheba[^h7614], and Dedan[^h1719]. And the sons[^h1121] of Dedan[^h1719] were Asshurim[^h805], and Letushim[^h3912], and Leummim[^h3817].
###### 4
And the sons[^h1121] of Midian[^h4080]; Ephah[^h5891], and Epher[^h6081], and Hanoch[^h2585], and Abida[^h28], and Eldaah[^h420]. All these were the children[^h1121] of Keturah[^h6989].
###### 5
And Abraham[^h85] gave[^h5414] all that he had unto Isaac[^h3327].
###### 6
But unto the sons[^h1121] of the concubines[^h6370], which Abraham[^h85] had, Abraham[^h85] gave[^h5414] gifts[^h4979], and sent them away[^h7971] from Isaac[^h3327] his son[^h1121], while he yet lived[^h2416], eastward[^h6924], unto the east[^h6924] country[^h776].
###### 7
And these are the days[^h3117] of the years[^h8141] of Abraham's[^h85] life[^h2416] which he lived[^h2425], an hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] threescore and fifteen[^h7657] [^h8141] [^h2568] years[^h8141].
###### 8
Then Abraham[^h85] gave up the ghost[^h1478], and died[^h4191] in a good[^h2896] old age[^h7872], an old man[^h2205], and full[^h7649] of years; and was gathered[^h622] to his people[^h5971].
###### 9
And his sons[^h1121] Isaac[^h3327] and Ishmael[^h3458] buried[^h6912] him in the cave[^h4631] of Machpelah[^h4375], in the field[^h7704] of Ephron[^h6085] the son[^h1121] of Zohar[^h6714] the Hittite[^h2850], which is before[^h6440] Mamre[^h4471];
###### 10
The field[^h7704] which Abraham[^h85] purchased[^h7069] of the sons[^h1121] of Heth[^h2845]: there was Abraham[^h85] buried[^h6912], and Sarah[^h8283] his wife[^h802].
###### 11
And it came to pass after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Abraham[^h85], that God[^h430] blessed[^h1288] his son[^h1121] Isaac[^h3327]; and Isaac[^h3327] dwelt[^h3427] by[^h5973] the well Lahairoi[^h883].
###### 12
Now these are the generations[^h8435] of Ishmael[^h3458], Abraham's[^h85] son[^h1121], whom Hagar[^h1904] the Egyptian[^h4713], Sarah's[^h8283] handmaid[^h8198], bare[^h3205] unto Abraham[^h85]:
###### 13
And these are the names[^h8034] of the sons[^h1121] of Ishmael[^h3458], by their names[^h8034], according to their generations[^h8435]: the firstborn[^h1060] of Ishmael[^h3458], Nebajoth[^h5032]; and Kedar[^h6938], and Adbeel[^h110], and Mibsam[^h4017],
###### 14
And Mishma[^h4927], and Dumah[^h1746], and Massa[^h4854],
###### 15
Hadar[^h2316], and Tema[^h8485], Jetur[^h3195], Naphish[^h5305], and Kedemah[^h6929]: 
###### 16
These are the sons[^h1121] of Ishmael[^h3458], and these are their names[^h8034], by their towns[^h2691], and by their castles[^h2918]; twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] princes[^h5387] according to their nations[^h523].
###### 17
And these are the years[^h8141] of the life[^h2416] of Ishmael[^h3458], an hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and thirty[^h7970] [^h8141] and seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]: and he gave up the ghost[^h1478] and died[^h4191]; and was gathered[^h622] unto his people[^h5971].
###### 18
And they dwelt[^h7931] from Havilah[^h2341] unto Shur[^h7793], that is before[^h6440] Egypt[^h4714], as thou goest[^h935] toward Assyria[^h804]: and he died[^h5307] in the presence[^h6440] of all his brethren[^h251]. 
###### 19
And these are the generations[^h8435] of Isaac[^h3327], Abraham's[^h85] son[^h1121]: Abraham[^h85] begat[^h3205] Isaac[^h3327]:
###### 20
And Isaac[^h3327] was forty[^h705] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he took[^h3947] Rebekah[^h7259] to wife[^h802], the daughter[^h1323] of Bethuel[^h1328] the Syrian[^h761] of Padanaram[^h6307], the sister[^h269] to Laban[^h3837] the Syrian[^h761].
###### 21
And Isaac[^h3327] intreated[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068] for[^h5227] his wife[^h802], because she was barren[^h6135]: and the LORD[^h3068] was intreated[^h6279] of him, and Rebekah[^h7259] his wife[^h802] conceived[^h2029].
###### 22
And the children[^h1121] struggled together[^h7533] within her[^h7130]; and she said[^h559], If it be so, why am I thus[^h2088]? And she went[^h3212] to enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto her, Two[^h8147] nations[^h1471] are in thy womb[^h990], and two manner[^h8147] of people[^h3816] shall be separated[^h6504] from thy bowels[^h4578]; and the one people[^h3816] shall be stronger[^h553] than the other people[^h3816]; and the elder[^h7227] shall serve[^h5647] the younger[^h6810].
###### 24
And when her days[^h3117] to be delivered[^h3205] were fulfilled[^h4390], behold, there were twins[^h8380] in her womb[^h990].
###### 25
And the first[^h7223] came out[^h3318] red[^h132], all over like an hairy[^h8181] garment[^h155]; and they called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Esau[^h6215].
###### 26
And after[^h310] that came[^h3318] his brother[^h251] out[^h3318], and his hand[^h3027] took hold[^h270] on Esau's[^h6215] heel[^h6119]; and his name[^h8034] was called[^h7121] Jacob[^h3290]: and Isaac[^h3327] was threescore[^h8346] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when she bare[^h3205] them.
###### 27
And the boys[^h5288] grew[^h1431]: and Esau[^h6215] was a cunning[^h3045] hunter[^h6718], a man[^h376] of the field[^h7704]; and Jacob[^h3290] was a plain[^h8535] man[^h376], dwelling[^h3427] in tents[^h168].
###### 28
And Isaac[^h3327] loved[^h157] Esau[^h6215], because he did eat[^h6310] of his venison[^h6718]: but Rebekah[^h7259] loved[^h157] Jacob[^h3290]. 
###### 29
And Jacob[^h3290] sod[^h2102] pottage[^h5138]: and Esau[^h6215] came[^h935] from the field[^h7704], and he was faint[^h5889]:
###### 30
And Esau[^h6215] said[^h559] to Jacob[^h3290], Feed[^h3938] me, I pray thee, with[^h4480] that same[^h122] red[^h122] pottage; for I am faint[^h5889]: therefore was his name[^h8034] called[^h7121] Edom[^h123].  
###### 31
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559], Sell[^h4376] me this day[^h3117] thy birthright[^h1062].
###### 32
And Esau[^h6215] said[^h559], Behold, I am at the point[^h1980] to die[^h4191]: and what profit shall this birthright[^h1062] do to me? 
###### 33
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559], Swear[^h7650] to me this day[^h3117]; and he sware[^h7650] unto him: and he sold[^h4376] his birthright[^h1062] unto Jacob[^h3290].
###### 34
Then Jacob[^h3290] gave[^h5414] Esau[^h6215] bread[^h3899] and pottage[^h5138] of lentiles[^h5742]; and he did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and rose up[^h6965], and went his way[^h3212]: thus Esau[^h6215] despised[^h959] his birthright[^h1062].

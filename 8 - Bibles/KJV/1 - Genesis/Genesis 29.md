###### 1
Then Jacob[^h3290] went on[^h5375] his journey[^h7272], and came[^h3212] into the land[^h776] of the people[^h1121] of the east[^h6924].  
###### 2
And he looked[^h7200], and behold a well[^h875] in the field[^h7704], and, lo, there were three[^h7969] flocks[^h5739] of sheep[^h6629] lying[^h7257] by it; for out of that well[^h875] they watered[^h8248] the flocks[^h5739]: and a great[^h1419] stone[^h68] was upon the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6310].
###### 3
And thither were all the flocks[^h5739] gathered[^h622]: and they rolled[^h1556] the stone[^h68] from the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6310], and watered[^h8248] the sheep[^h6629], and put[^h7725] the stone[^h68] again[^h7725] upon the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6310] in his place[^h4725].
###### 4
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto them, My brethren[^h251], whence[^h370] be ye? And they said[^h559], Of Haran[^h2771] are we.
###### 5
And he said[^h559] unto them, Know[^h3045] ye Laban[^h3837] the son[^h1121] of Nahor[^h5152]? And they said[^h559], We know[^h3045] him.
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto them, Is he well[^h7965]? And they said[^h559], He is well[^h7965]: and, behold, Rachel[^h7354] his daughter[^h1323] cometh[^h935] with the sheep[^h6629]. 
###### 7
And he said[^h559], Lo[^h2005], it is yet high[^h1419] day[^h3117], neither is it time[^h6256] that the cattle[^h4735] should be gathered together[^h622]: water[^h8248] ye the sheep[^h6629], and go[^h3212] and feed[^h7462] them. 
###### 8
And they said[^h559], We cannot[^h3201], until all the flocks[^h5739] be gathered together[^h622], and till they roll[^h1556] the stone[^h68] from the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6310]; then we water[^h8248] the sheep[^h6629].
###### 9
And while he yet[^h5750] spake[^h1696] with them, Rachel[^h7354] came[^h935] with her father's[^h1] sheep[^h6629]: for she kept them[^h7462].
###### 10
And it came to pass, when Jacob[^h3290] saw[^h7200] Rachel[^h7354] the daughter[^h1323] of Laban[^h3837] his mother's[^h517] brother[^h251], and the sheep[^h6629] of Laban[^h3837] his mother's[^h517] brother[^h251], that Jacob[^h3290] went near[^h5066], and rolled[^h1556] the stone[^h68] from the well's[^h875] mouth[^h6310], and watered[^h8248] the flock[^h6629] of Laban[^h3837] his mother's[^h517] brother[^h251].
###### 11
And Jacob[^h3290] kissed[^h5401] Rachel[^h7354], and lifted up[^h5375] his voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 12
And Jacob[^h3290] told[^h5046] Rachel[^h7354] that he was her father's[^h1] brother[^h251], and that he was Rebekah's[^h7259] son[^h1121]: and she ran[^h7323] and told[^h5046] her father[^h1].
###### 13
And it came to pass, when Laban[^h3837] heard[^h8085] the tidings[^h8088] of Jacob[^h3290] his sister's[^h269] son[^h1121], that he ran[^h7323] to meet[^h7125] him, and embraced[^h2263] him, and kissed[^h5401] him, and brought[^h935] him to his house[^h1004]. And he told[^h5608] Laban[^h3837] all these things[^h1697]. 
###### 14
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559] to him, Surely[^h389] thou art my bone[^h6106] and my flesh[^h1320]. And he abode[^h3427] with him the space[^h3117] of a month[^h2320]. 
###### 15
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], Because thou art my brother[^h251], shouldest thou therefore serve[^h5647] me for nought[^h2600]? tell[^h5046] me, what shall thy wages[^h4909] be?
###### 16
And Laban[^h3837] had two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323]: the name[^h8034] of the elder[^h1419] was Leah[^h3812], and the name[^h8034] of the younger[^h6996] was Rachel[^h7354].
###### 17
Leah[^h3812] was tender[^h7390] eyed[^h5869]; but Rachel[^h7354] was beautiful[^h3303] [^h8389] and well[^h3303] favoured[^h4758].
###### 18
And Jacob[^h3290] loved[^h157] Rachel[^h7354]; and said[^h559], I will serve[^h5647] thee seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] for Rachel[^h7354] thy younger[^h6996] daughter[^h1323].
###### 19
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559], It is better[^h2896] that I give[^h5414] her to thee, than that I should give[^h5414] her to another[^h312] man[^h376]: abide[^h3427] with me.
###### 20
And Jacob[^h3290] served[^h5647] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] for Rachel[^h7354]; and they seemed[^h5869] unto him but a few[^h259] days[^h3117], for the love he had[^h160] to her.
###### 21
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto Laban[^h3837], Give[^h3051] me my wife[^h802], for my days[^h3117] are fulfilled[^h4390], that I may go in[^h935] unto her.
###### 22
And Laban[^h3837] gathered together[^h622] all the men[^h582] of the place[^h4725], and made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960].
###### 23
And it came to pass in the evening[^h6153], that he took[^h3947] Leah[^h3812] his daughter[^h1323], and brought[^h935] her to him; and he went in[^h935] unto her.
###### 24
And Laban[^h3837] gave[^h5414] unto his daughter[^h1323] Leah[^h3812] Zilpah[^h2153] his maid[^h8198] for an handmaid[^h8198].
###### 25
And it came to pass, that in the morning[^h1242], behold, it was Leah[^h3812]: and he said[^h559] to Laban[^h3837], What is this thou hast done[^h6213] unto me? did not I serve[^h5647] with thee for Rachel[^h7354]? wherefore then hast thou beguiled[^h7411] me?
###### 26
And Laban[^h3837] said[^h559], It must not be so done[^h6213] in our country[^h4725], to give[^h5414] the younger[^h6810] before[^h6440] the firstborn[^h1067]. 
###### 27
Fulfil[^h4390] her[^h2063] week[^h7620], and we will give[^h5414] thee this also for the service[^h5656] which thou shalt serve[^h5647] with me yet seven[^h7651] other[^h312] years[^h8141].
###### 28
And Jacob[^h3290] did[^h6213] so, and fulfilled[^h4390] her week[^h7620]: and he gave[^h5414] him Rachel[^h7354] his daughter[^h1323] to wife[^h802] also.
###### 29
And Laban[^h3837] gave[^h5414] to Rachel[^h7354] his daughter[^h1323] Bilhah[^h1090] his handmaid[^h8198] to be her maid[^h8198].
###### 30
And he went in[^h935] also unto Rachel[^h7354], and he loved[^h157] also Rachel[^h7354] more than Leah[^h3812], and served[^h5647] with him yet seven[^h7651] other[^h312] years[^h8141].
###### 31
And when the LORD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] that Leah[^h3812] was hated[^h8130], he opened[^h6605] her womb[^h7358]: but Rachel[^h7354] was barren[^h6135].
###### 32
And Leah[^h3812] conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Reuben[^h7205]: for[^h3588] she said[^h559], Surely[^h3588] the LORD[^h3068] hath looked[^h7200] upon my affliction[^h6040]; now therefore[^h3588] my husband[^h376] will love[^h157] me. 
###### 33
And she conceived[^h2029] again, and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and said[^h559], Because the LORD[^h3068] hath heard[^h8085] that I was hated[^h8130], he hath therefore given[^h5414] me this son also: and she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Simeon[^h8095]. 
###### 34
And she conceived again[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and said[^h559], Now this time[^h6471] will my husband[^h376] be joined[^h3867] unto me, because I have born[^h3205] him three[^h7969] sons[^h1121]: therefore was his name[^h8034] called[^h7121] Levi[^h3878]. 
###### 35
And she conceived[^h2029] again, and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]: and she said[^h559], Now[^h6471] will I praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068]: therefore she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Judah[^h3063]; and left[^h5975] bearing[^h3205].

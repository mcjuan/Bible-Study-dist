###### 1
And Jacob[^h3290] dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] wherein his father[^h1] was a stranger[^h4033], in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]. 
###### 2
These are the generations[^h8435] of Jacob[^h3290]. Joseph[^h3130], being seventeen[^h6240] [^h7651] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], was feeding[^h7462] the flock[^h6629] with his brethren[^h251]; and the lad[^h5288] was with the sons[^h1121] of Bilhah[^h1090], and with the sons[^h1121] of Zilpah[^h2153], his father's[^h1] wives[^h802]: and Joseph[^h3130] brought[^h935] unto his father[^h1] their evil[^h7451] report[^h1681].
###### 3
Now Israel[^h3478] loved[^h157] Joseph[^h3130] more than all his children[^h1121], because he was the son[^h1121] of his old age[^h2208]: and he made[^h6213] him a coat[^h3801] of many colours[^h6446]. 
###### 4
And when his brethren[^h251] saw[^h7200] that their father[^h1] loved[^h157] him more than all his brethren[^h251], they hated[^h8130] him, and could[^h3201] not speak[^h1696] peaceably[^h7965] unto him.
###### 5
And Joseph[^h3130] dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472], and he told[^h5046] it his brethren[^h251]: and they hated[^h8130] him yet the more[^h3254].
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto them, Hear[^h8085], I pray you, this dream[^h2472] which I have dreamed[^h2492]:
###### 7
For, behold, we were binding[^h481] [^h8432] sheaves[^h485] in the field[^h7704], and, lo, my sheaf[^h485] arose[^h6965], and also stood upright[^h5324]; and, behold, your sheaves[^h485] stood round about[^h5437], and made obeisance[^h7812] to my sheaf[^h485].
###### 8
And his brethren[^h251] said[^h559] to him, Shalt thou indeed[^h4427] reign[^h4427] over us? or shalt thou indeed[^h4910] have dominion[^h4910] over us? And they hated[^h8130] him yet the more[^h3254] for his dreams[^h2472], and for his words[^h1697].
###### 9
And he dreamed[^h2492] yet another[^h312] dream[^h2472], and told[^h5608] it his brethren[^h251], and said[^h559], Behold, I have dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472] more; and, behold, the sun[^h8121] and the moon[^h3394] and the eleven[^h6240] [^h259] stars[^h3556] made obeisance[^h7812] to me.
###### 10
And he told[^h5608] it to his father[^h1], and to his brethren[^h251]: and his father[^h1] rebuked[^h1605] him, and said[^h559] unto him, What is this dream[^h2472] that thou hast dreamed[^h2492]? Shall I and thy mother[^h517] and thy brethren[^h251] indeed[^h935] come[^h935] to bow down[^h7812] ourselves to thee to the earth[^h776]?
###### 11
And his brethren[^h251] envied[^h7065] him; but his father[^h1] observed[^h8104] the saying[^h1697].
###### 12
And his brethren[^h251] went[^h3212] to feed[^h7462] their father's[^h1] flock[^h6629] in Shechem[^h7927].
###### 13
And Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], Do not thy brethren[^h251] feed[^h7462] the flock in Shechem[^h7927]? come[^h3212], and I will send thee[^h7971] unto them. And he said[^h559] to him, Here am I.
###### 14
And he said[^h559] to him, Go[^h3212], I pray thee, see[^h7200] whether it be well[^h7965] with thy brethren[^h251], and well[^h7965] with the flocks[^h6629]; and bring[^h7725] me word[^h1697] again[^h7725]. So he sent[^h7971] him out of the vale[^h6010] of Hebron[^h2275], and he came[^h935] to Shechem[^h7927]. 
###### 15
And a certain man[^h376] found him[^h4672], and, behold, he was wandering[^h8582] in the field[^h7704]: and the man[^h376] asked him[^h7592], saying[^h559], What seekest[^h1245] thou?
###### 16
And he said[^h559], I seek[^h1245] my brethren[^h251]: tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, where[^h375] they feed[^h7462] their flocks.
###### 17
And the man[^h376] said[^h559], They are departed[^h5265] hence[^h2088]; for I heard[^h8085] them say[^h559], Let us go[^h3212] to Dothan[^h1886]. And Joseph[^h3130] went[^h3212] after[^h310] his brethren[^h251], and found[^h4672] them in Dothan[^h1886].
###### 18
And when they saw[^h7200] him afar off[^h7350], even before he came near[^h7126] unto them, they conspired[^h5230] against him to slay[^h4191] him.
###### 19
And they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], Behold, this[^h1976] dreamer[^h1167] [^h2472] cometh[^h935]. 
###### 20
Come[^h3212] now therefore, and let us slay[^h2026] him, and cast[^h7993] him into some[^h259] pit[^h953], and we will say[^h559], Some evil[^h7451] beast[^h2416] hath devoured[^h398] him: and we shall see[^h7200] what will become of his dreams[^h2472].
###### 21
And Reuben[^h7205] heard[^h8085] it, and he delivered[^h5337] him out of their hands[^h3027]; and said[^h559], Let us not kill[^h5221] [^h5315] him.
###### 22
And Reuben[^h7205] said[^h559] unto them, Shed[^h8210] no blood[^h1818], but cast[^h7993] him into this pit[^h953] that is in the wilderness[^h4057], and lay[^h7971] no hand[^h3027] upon him; that he might rid[^h5337] him out of their hands[^h3027], to deliver[^h7725] him to his father[^h1] again[^h7725].
###### 23
And it came to pass, when Joseph[^h3130] was come[^h935] unto his brethren[^h251], that they stript[^h6584] [^h853] Joseph[^h3130] out of[^h854] his coat[^h3801], his coat[^h3801] of many colours[^h6446] that was on him; 
###### 24
And they took[^h3947] him, and cast[^h7993] him into a pit[^h953]: and the pit[^h953] was empty[^h7386], there was no water[^h4325] in it.
###### 25
And they sat down[^h3427] to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899]: and they lifted up[^h5375] their eyes[^h5869] and looked[^h7200], and, behold, a company[^h736] of Ishmeelites[^h3459] came[^h935] from Gilead[^h1568] with their camels[^h1581] bearing[^h5375] spicery[^h5219] and balm[^h6875] and myrrh[^h3910], going[^h1980] to carry it down[^h3381] to Egypt[^h4714].
###### 26
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], What profit[^h1215] is it if we slay[^h2026] our brother[^h251], and conceal[^h3680] his blood[^h1818]?
###### 27
Come[^h3212], and let us sell[^h4376] him to the Ishmeelites[^h3459], and let not our hand[^h3027] be upon him; for he is our brother[^h251] and our flesh[^h1320]. And his brethren[^h251] were content[^h8085]. 
###### 28
Then there passed[^h5674] by Midianites[^h4084] merchantmen[^h582] [^h5503]; and they drew[^h4900] and lifted up[^h5927] Joseph[^h3130] out of the pit[^h953], and sold[^h4376] Joseph[^h3130] to the Ishmeelites[^h3459] for twenty[^h6242] pieces of silver[^h3701]: and they brought[^h935] Joseph[^h3130] into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 29
And Reuben[^h7205] returned[^h7725] unto the pit[^h953]; and, behold, Joseph[^h3130] was not in the pit[^h953]; and he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899].
###### 30
And he returned[^h7725] unto his brethren[^h251], and said[^h559], The child[^h3206] is not; and I, whither[^h575] shall I go[^h935]?
###### 31
And they took[^h3947] Joseph's[^h3130] coat[^h3801], and killed[^h7819] a kid[^h8163] of the goats[^h5795], and dipped[^h2881] the coat[^h3801] in the blood[^h1818];
###### 32
And they sent[^h7971] the coat[^h3801] of many colours[^h6446], and they brought[^h935] it to their father[^h1]; and said[^h559], This have we found[^h4672]: know[^h5234] now whether it be thy son's[^h1121] coat[^h3801] or no.
###### 33
And he knew it[^h5234], and said[^h559], It is my son's[^h1121] coat[^h3801]; an evil[^h7451] beast[^h2416] hath devoured[^h398] him; Joseph[^h3130] is without doubt[^h2963] rent in pieces[^h2963].
###### 34
And Jacob[^h3290] rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h8071], and put[^h7760] sackcloth[^h8242] upon his loins[^h4975], and mourned[^h56] for his son[^h1121] many[^h7227] days[^h3117].
###### 35
And all his sons[^h1121] and all his daughters[^h1323] rose up[^h6965] to comfort[^h5162] him; but he refused[^h3985] to be comforted[^h5162]; and he said[^h559], For I will go down[^h3381] into the grave[^h7585] unto my son[^h1121] mourning[^h57]. Thus his father[^h1] wept[^h1058] for him.
###### 36
And the Midianites[^h4092] sold[^h4376] him into Egypt[^h4714] unto Potiphar[^h6318], an officer[^h5631] of Pharaoh's[^h6547], and captain[^h8269] of the guard[^h2876].

###### 1
Then Joseph[^h3130] could[^h3201] not refrain[^h662] himself before all them that stood[^h5324] by him; and he cried[^h7121], Cause[^h3318] every man[^h376] to go out[^h3318] from me. And there stood[^h5975] no man[^h376] with him, while Joseph[^h3130] made himself known[^h3045] unto his brethren[^h251].
###### 2
And he wept[^h6963] [^h1065] aloud[^h5414]: and the Egyptians[^h4714] and the house[^h1004] of Pharaoh[^h6547] heard[^h8085] [^h8085]. 
###### 3
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], I am Joseph[^h3130]; doth my father[^h1] yet live[^h2416]? And his brethren[^h251] could[^h3201] not answer[^h6030] him; for they were troubled[^h926] at his presence[^h6440]. 
###### 4
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], Come near[^h5066] to me, I pray you. And they came near[^h5066]. And he said[^h559], I am Joseph[^h3130] your brother[^h251], whom ye sold[^h4376] into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
Now therefore be not grieved[^h6087], nor angry[^h2734] with yourselves[^h5869], that ye sold[^h4376] me hither: for God[^h430] did send[^h7971] me before you[^h6440] to preserve life[^h4241]. 
###### 6
For these two years[^h8141] hath the famine[^h7458] been in[^h7130] the land[^h776]: and yet there are five[^h2568] years[^h8141], in the which there shall neither[^h369] be earing[^h2758] nor harvest[^h7105].
###### 7
And God[^h430] sent[^h7971] me before you[^h6440] to preserve[^h7760] you a posterity[^h7611] in the earth[^h776], and to save your lives[^h2421] by a great[^h1419] deliverance[^h6413]. 
###### 8
So now it was not you that sent[^h7971] me hither, but God[^h430]: and he hath made[^h7760] me a father[^h1] to Pharaoh[^h6547], and lord[^h113] of all his house[^h1004], and a ruler[^h4910] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 9
Haste[^h4116] ye, and go up[^h5927] to my father[^h1], and say[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] thy son[^h1121] Joseph[^h3130], God[^h430] hath made[^h7760] me lord[^h113] of all Egypt[^h4714]: come down[^h3381] unto me, tarry[^h5975] not:
###### 10
And thou shalt dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657], and thou shalt be near[^h7138] unto me, thou, and thy children[^h1121], and thy children's[^h1121] children[^h1121], and thy flocks[^h6629], and thy herds[^h1241], and all that thou hast:
###### 11
And there will I nourish[^h3557] thee; for yet there are five[^h2568] years[^h8141] of famine[^h7458]; lest thou, and thy household[^h1004], and all that thou hast, come to poverty[^h3423].
###### 12
And, behold, your eyes[^h5869] see[^h7200], and the eyes[^h5869] of my brother[^h251] Benjamin[^h1144], that it is my mouth[^h6310] that speaketh[^h1696] unto you.
###### 13
And ye shall tell[^h5046] my father[^h1] of all my glory[^h3519] in Egypt[^h4714], and of all that ye have seen[^h7200]; and ye shall haste[^h4116] and bring down[^h3381] my father[^h1] hither.
###### 14
And he fell[^h5307] upon his brother[^h251] Benjamin's[^h1144] neck[^h6677], and wept[^h1058]; and Benjamin[^h1144] wept[^h1058] upon his neck[^h6677].
###### 15
Moreover he kissed[^h5401] all his brethren[^h251], and wept[^h1058] upon them: and after[^h310] that his brethren[^h251] talked[^h1696] with him.
###### 16
And the fame[^h6963] thereof was heard[^h8085] in Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004], saying[^h559], Joseph's[^h3130] brethren[^h251] are come[^h935]: and it pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] Pharaoh[^h6547] well[^h3190] [^h5869], and[^h5869] his servants[^h5650]. 
###### 17
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], Say[^h559] unto thy brethren[^h251], This do[^h6213] ye; lade[^h2943] your beasts[^h1165], and go[^h3212], get[^h935] you unto the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667];
###### 18
And take[^h3947] your father[^h1] and your households[^h1004], and come[^h935] unto me: and I will give[^h5414] you the good[^h2898] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and ye shall eat[^h398] the fat[^h2459] of the land[^h776].
###### 19
Now thou art commanded[^h6680], this do[^h6213] ye; take[^h3947] you wagons[^h5699] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] for your little ones[^h2945], and for your wives[^h802], and bring[^h5375] your father[^h1], and come[^h935].
###### 20
Also[^h5869] regard[^h2347] not your stuff[^h3627]; for the good[^h2898] of all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] is yours. 
###### 21
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] so: and Joseph[^h3130] gave[^h5414] them wagons[^h5699], according to the commandment[^h6310] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and gave[^h5414] them provision[^h6720] for the way[^h1870]. 
###### 22
To all of them he gave[^h5414] each man[^h376] changes[^h2487] of raiment[^h8071]; but to Benjamin[^h1144] he gave[^h5414] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] pieces of silver[^h3701], and five[^h2568] changes[^h2487] of raiment[^h8071].
###### 23
And to his father[^h1] he sent[^h7971] after this[^h2063] manner; ten[^h6235] asses[^h860] laden[^h5375] with the good things[^h2898] of Egypt[^h4714], and ten[^h6235] she asses[^h2543] laden[^h5375] with corn[^h1250] and bread[^h3899] and meat[^h4202] for his father[^h1] by the way[^h1870]. 
###### 24
So he sent[^h7971] his brethren[^h251] away[^h7971], and they departed[^h3212]: and he said[^h559] unto them, See that ye fall not out[^h7264] by the way[^h1870].
###### 25
And they went up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], and came[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] unto Jacob[^h3290] their father[^h1],
###### 26
And told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], Joseph[^h3130] is yet alive[^h2416], and he is governor[^h4910] over all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. And Jacob's heart[^h3820] fainted[^h6313], for he believed[^h539] them not. 
###### 27
And they told[^h1696] him all the words[^h1697] of Joseph[^h3130], which he had said[^h1696] unto them: and when he saw[^h7200] the wagons[^h5699] which Joseph[^h3130] had sent[^h7971] to carry[^h5375] him, the spirit[^h7307] of Jacob[^h3290] their father[^h1] revived[^h2421]:
###### 28
And Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], It is enough[^h7227]; Joseph[^h3130] my son[^h1121] is yet alive[^h2416]: I will go[^h3212] and see him[^h7200] before I die[^h4191].

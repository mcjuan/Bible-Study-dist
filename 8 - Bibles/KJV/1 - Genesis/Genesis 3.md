###### 1
Now the serpent[^h5175] was[^h1961] more subtil[^h6175] than any beast[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] which the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] had made[^h6213]. And he said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], Yea[^h637], hath God[^h430] said[^h559], Ye shall not eat[^h398] of every tree[^h6086] of the garden[^h1588]? 
###### 2
And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto the serpent[^h5175], We may eat[^h398] of the fruit[^h6529] of the trees[^h6086] of the garden[^h1588]:
###### 3
But of the fruit[^h6529] of the tree[^h6086] which is in the midst[^h8432] of the garden[^h1588], God[^h430] hath said[^h559], Ye shall not eat[^h398] of it, neither shall ye touch[^h5060] it, lest[^h6435] ye die[^h4191].
###### 4
And the serpent[^h5175] said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], Ye shall not surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]:
###### 5
For God[^h430] doth know[^h3045] that in the day[^h3117] ye eat[^h398] thereof, then your eyes[^h5869] shall be opened[^h6491], and ye shall be as gods[^h430], knowing[^h3045] good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451].
###### 6
And when the woman[^h802] saw[^h7200] that the tree[^h6086] was good[^h2896] for food[^h3978], and that it[^h1931] was pleasant[^h8378] to the eyes[^h5869], and a tree[^h6086] to be desired[^h2530] to make one wise[^h7919], she took[^h3947] of the fruit thereof[^h6529], and did eat[^h398], and gave[^h5414] also[^h1571] unto her husband[^h376] with her; and he did eat[^h398]. 
###### 7
And the eyes[^h5869] of them both[^h8147] were opened[^h6491], and they[^h1992] knew[^h3045] that they were naked[^h5903]; and they sewed[^h8609] fig[^h8384] leaves[^h5929] together[^h8609], and made themselves[^h6213] aprons[^h2290]. 
###### 8
And they heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] walking[^h1980] in the garden[^h1588] in the cool[^h7307] of the day[^h3117]: and Adam[^h120] and his wife[^h802] hid themselves[^h2244] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] amongst[^h8432] the trees[^h6086] of the garden[^h1588]. 
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] called[^h7121] unto Adam[^h120], and said[^h559] unto him, Where art thou[^h335]?
###### 10
And he said[^h559], I heard[^h8085] thy voice[^h6963] in the garden[^h1588], and I was afraid[^h3372], because I[^h595] was naked[^h5903]; and I hid myself[^h2244].
###### 11
And he said[^h559], Who[^h4310] told[^h5046] thee that thou wast naked[^h5903]? Hast thou eaten[^h398] of the tree[^h6086], whereof I commanded thee[^h6680] that thou shouldest not[^h1115] eat[^h398]?
###### 12
And the man[^h120] said[^h559], The woman[^h802] whom thou gavest[^h5414] to be with me[^h5978], she[^h1931] gave[^h5414] me of the tree[^h6086], and I did eat[^h398].
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], What is this that thou hast done[^h6213]? And the woman[^h802] said[^h559], The serpent[^h5175] beguiled me[^h5377], and I did eat[^h398].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] said[^h559] unto the serpent[^h5175], Because thou[^h859] hast done[^h6213] this, thou art cursed[^h779] above all cattle[^h929], and above every beast[^h2416] of the field[^h7704]; upon thy belly[^h1512] shalt thou go[^h3212], and dust[^h6083] shalt thou eat[^h398] all the days[^h3117] of thy life[^h2416]:
###### 15
And I will put[^h7896] enmity[^h342] between thee and the woman[^h802], and between thy seed[^h2233] and her seed[^h2233]; it shall bruise[^h7779] thy head[^h7218], and thou shalt bruise[^h7779] his heel[^h6119].
###### 16
Unto the woman[^h802] he said[^h559], I will greatly[^h7235] multiply[^h7235] thy sorrow[^h6093] and thy conception[^h2032]; in sorrow[^h6089] thou shalt bring forth[^h3205] children[^h1121]; and thy desire[^h8669] shall be to thy husband[^h376], and he shall rule[^h4910] over thee. 
###### 17
And unto Adam[^h121] he said[^h559], Because thou hast hearkened[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of thy wife[^h802], and hast eaten[^h398] of the tree[^h6086], of which[^h834] I commanded thee[^h6680], saying[^h559], Thou shalt not eat[^h398] of it: cursed[^h779] is the ground[^h127] for thy sake; in sorrow[^h6093] shalt thou eat[^h398] of it all[^h3605] the days[^h3117] of thy life[^h2416];
###### 18
Thorns also[^h6975] and thistles[^h1863] shall it bring forth[^h6779] to thee; and thou shalt eat[^h398] the herb[^h6212] of the field[^h7704]; 
###### 19
In the sweat[^h2188] of thy face[^h639] shalt thou eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], till[^h5704] thou return[^h7725] unto the ground[^h127]; for out of it wast thou taken[^h3947]: for dust[^h6083] thou[^h859] art, and unto dust[^h6083] shalt thou return[^h7725].
###### 20
And Adam[^h120] called[^h7121] his wife's[^h802] name[^h8034] Eve[^h2332]; because she was the mother[^h517] of all living[^h2416]. 
###### 21
Unto Adam[^h120] also and to his wife[^h802] did the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] make[^h6213] coats[^h3801] of skins[^h5785], and clothed them[^h3847].
###### 22
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] said[^h559], Behold[^h2005], the man[^h120] is become as one[^h259] of us, to know[^h3045] good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451]: and now, lest he put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and take[^h3947] also of the tree[^h6086] of life[^h2416], and eat[^h398], and live[^h2425] for ever[^h5769]:
###### 23
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] sent him forth[^h7971] from the garden[^h1588] of Eden[^h5731], to till[^h5647] the ground[^h127] from whence he was taken[^h3947].
###### 24
So he drove out[^h1644] the man[^h120]; and he placed[^h7931] at the east[^h6924] of the garden[^h1588] of Eden[^h5731] Cherubims[^h3742], and a flaming[^h3858] sword[^h2719] which turned every way[^h2015], to keep[^h8104] the way[^h1870] of the tree[^h6086] of life[^h2416].

###### 1
And Jacob[^h3290] went[^h1980] on his way[^h1870], and the angels[^h4397] of God[^h430] met[^h6293] him.
###### 2
And when Jacob[^h3290] saw them[^h7200], he said[^h559], This is God's[^h430] host[^h4264]: and he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] Mahanaim[^h4266]. 
###### 3
And Jacob[^h3290] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] before him[^h6440] to Esau[^h6215] his brother[^h251] unto the land[^h776] of Seir[^h8165], the country[^h7704] of Edom[^h123]. 
###### 4
And he commanded[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], Thus shall ye speak[^h559] unto my lord[^h113] Esau[^h6215]; Thy servant[^h5650] Jacob[^h3290] saith[^h559] thus, I have sojourned[^h1481] with Laban[^h3837], and stayed there[^h309] until now:
###### 5
And I have oxen[^h7794], and asses[^h2543], flocks[^h6629], and menservants[^h5650], and womenservants[^h8198]: and I have sent[^h7971] to tell[^h5046] my lord[^h113], that I may find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869].
###### 6
And the messengers[^h4397] returned[^h7725] to Jacob[^h3290], saying[^h559], We came[^h935] to thy brother[^h251] Esau[^h6215], and also he cometh[^h1980] to meet thee[^h7125], and four hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] with him.
###### 7
Then Jacob[^h3290] was greatly[^h3966] afraid[^h3372] and distressed[^h3334]: and he divided[^h2673] the people[^h5971] that was with him, and the flocks[^h6629], and herds[^h1241], and the camels[^h1581], into two[^h8147] bands[^h4264];
###### 8
And said[^h559], If Esau[^h6215] come[^h935] to the one[^h259] company[^h4264], and smite it[^h5221], then the other company[^h4264] which is left[^h7604] shall escape[^h6413].
###### 9
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559], O God[^h430] of my father[^h1] Abraham[^h85], and God[^h430] of my father[^h1] Isaac[^h3327], the LORD[^h3068] which saidst[^h559] unto me, Return[^h7725] unto thy country[^h776], and to thy kindred[^h4138], and I will deal well[^h3190] with thee:
###### 10
I am not worthy of the least[^h6994] of all the mercies[^h2617], and of all the truth[^h571], which thou hast shewed[^h6213] unto thy servant[^h5650]; for with my staff[^h4731] I passed over[^h5674] this Jordan[^h3383]; and now I am become two[^h8147] bands[^h4264]. 
###### 11
Deliver me[^h5337], I pray thee, from the hand[^h3027] of my brother[^h251], from the hand[^h3027] of Esau[^h6215]: for I fear[^h3373] him, lest he will come[^h935] and smite me[^h5221], and the mother[^h517] with[^h5921] the children[^h1121]. 
###### 12
And thou saidst[^h559], I will surely[^h3190] do thee good[^h3190], and make[^h7760] thy seed[^h2233] as the sand[^h2344] of the sea[^h3220], which cannot be numbered[^h5608] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 13
And he lodged[^h3885] there that same night[^h3915]; and took[^h3947] of that which came[^h935] to his hand[^h3027] a present[^h4503] for Esau[^h6215] his brother[^h251];
###### 14
Two hundred[^h3967] she goats[^h5795], and twenty[^h6242] he goats[^h8495], two hundred[^h3967] ewes[^h7353], and twenty[^h6242] rams[^h352],
###### 15
Thirty[^h7970] milch[^h3243] camels[^h1581] with their colts[^h1121], forty[^h705] kine[^h6510], and ten[^h6235] bulls[^h6499], twenty[^h6242] she asses[^h860], and ten[^h6235] foals[^h5895].
###### 16
And he delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650], every drove[^h5739] by themselves; and said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Pass over[^h5674] before me[^h6440], and put[^h7760] a space[^h7305] betwixt[^h996] drove[^h5739] and[^h996] drove[^h5739].
###### 17
And he commanded[^h6680] the foremost[^h7223], saying[^h559], When Esau[^h6215] my brother[^h251] meeteth thee[^h6298], and asketh thee[^h7592], saying[^h559], Whose art thou? and whither goest[^h3212] thou? and whose are these before[^h6440] thee?
###### 18
Then thou shalt say[^h559], They be thy servant[^h5650] Jacob's[^h3290]; it is a present[^h4503] sent[^h7971] unto my lord[^h113] Esau[^h6215]: and, behold, also he is behind us[^h310].
###### 19
And so[^h1571] commanded he[^h6680] the second[^h8145], and the third[^h7992], and all that followed[^h1980] [^h310] the droves[^h5739], saying[^h559], On this manner[^h1697] shall ye speak[^h1696] unto Esau[^h6215], when ye find[^h4672] him.
###### 20
And say ye[^h559] moreover[^h1571], Behold, thy servant[^h5650] Jacob[^h3290] is behind us[^h310]. For he said[^h559], I will appease[^h3722] him[^h6440] with the present[^h4503] that goeth[^h1980] before me[^h6440], and afterward[^h310] I will see[^h7200] his face[^h6440]; peradventure he will accept[^h5375] of me[^h6440]. 
###### 21
So went[^h5674] the present[^h4503] over[^h5674] before him[^h6440]: and himself lodged[^h3885] that night[^h3915] in the company[^h4264].
###### 22
And he rose up[^h6965] that night[^h3915], and took[^h3947] his two[^h8147] wives[^h802], and his two[^h8147] womenservants[^h8198], and his eleven[^h6240] [^h259] sons[^h3206], and passed over[^h5674] the ford[^h4569] Jabbok[^h2999].
###### 23
And he took them[^h3947], and sent them over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158], and sent over[^h5674] that he had. 
###### 24
And Jacob[^h3290] was left[^h3498] alone; and there wrestled[^h79] a man[^h376] with him until the breaking[^h5927] of the day[^h7837]. 
###### 25
And when he saw[^h7200] that he prevailed[^h3201] not against him, he touched[^h5060] the hollow of his thigh[^h3409]; and the hollow[^h3709] of Jacob's[^h3290] thigh[^h3409] was out of joint[^h3363], as he wrestled[^h79] with him.
###### 26
And he said[^h559], Let me go[^h7971], for the day[^h7837] breaketh[^h5927]. And he said[^h559], I will not let thee go[^h7971], except[^h518] thou bless[^h1288] me.
###### 27
And he said[^h559] unto him, What is thy name[^h8034]? And he said[^h559], Jacob[^h3290].
###### 28
And he said[^h559], Thy name[^h8034] shall be called[^h559] no more Jacob[^h3290], but Israel[^h3478]: for as a prince hast thou power[^h8280] with God[^h430] and with men[^h582], and hast prevailed[^h3201]. 
###### 29
And Jacob[^h3290] asked[^h7592] him, and said[^h559], Tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, thy name[^h8034]. And he said[^h559], Wherefore is it[^h2088] that thou dost ask[^h7592] after my name[^h8034]? And he blessed[^h1288] him there.
###### 30
And Jacob[^h3290] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the place[^h4725] Peniel[^h6439]: for I have seen[^h7200] God[^h430] face[^h6440] to face[^h6440], and my life[^h5315] is preserved[^h5337]. 
###### 31
And as he passed over[^h5674] Penuel[^h6439] the sun[^h8121] rose[^h2224] upon him, and he halted[^h6760] upon his thigh[^h3409].
###### 32
Therefore the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] eat[^h398] not of the sinew[^h1517] which shrank[^h5384], which is upon the hollow[^h3709] of the thigh[^h3409], unto this day[^h3117]: because he touched[^h5060] the hollow[^h3709] of Jacob's[^h3290] thigh[^h3409] in the sinew[^h1517] that shrank[^h5384].

###### 1
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of two full[^h3117] years[^h8141], that Pharaoh[^h6547] dreamed[^h2492]: and, behold, he stood[^h5975] by the river[^h2975].
###### 2
And, behold, there came up[^h5927] out of the river[^h2975] seven[^h7651] well[^h3303] favoured[^h4758] kine[^h6510] and fatfleshed[^h1277] [^h1320]; and they fed[^h7462] in a meadow[^h260].
###### 3
And, behold, seven[^h7651] other[^h312] kine[^h6510] came up[^h5927] after them[^h310] out of the river[^h2975], ill[^h7451] favoured[^h4758] and leanfleshed[^h1851] [^h1320]; and stood[^h5975] by[^h681] the other kine[^h6510] upon the brink[^h8193] of the river[^h2975].
###### 4
And the ill[^h7451] favoured[^h4758] and leanfleshed[^h1851] [^h1320] kine[^h6510] did eat up[^h398] the seven[^h7651] well[^h3303] favoured[^h4758] and fat[^h1277] kine[^h6510]. So Pharaoh[^h6547] awoke[^h3364].
###### 5
And he slept[^h3462] and dreamed[^h2492] the second time[^h8145]: and, behold, seven[^h7651] ears of corn[^h7641] came up[^h5927] upon one[^h259] stalk[^h7070], rank[^h1277] and good[^h2896]. 
###### 6
And, behold, seven[^h7651] thin[^h1851] ears[^h7641] and blasted[^h7710] with the east wind[^h6921] sprung up[^h6779] after them[^h310].
###### 7
And the seven thin[^h1851] ears[^h7641] devoured[^h1104] the seven[^h7651] rank[^h1277] and full[^h4392] ears[^h7641]. And Pharaoh[^h6547] awoke[^h3364], and, behold, it was a dream[^h2472].
###### 8
And it came to pass in the morning[^h1242] that his spirit[^h7307] was troubled[^h6470]; and he sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] for all the magicians[^h2748] of Egypt[^h4714], and all the wise men[^h2450] thereof: and Pharaoh[^h6547] told[^h5608] them his dream[^h2472]; but there was none that could interpret[^h6622] them unto Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 9
Then spake[^h1696] the chief[^h8269] butler[^h8248] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], saying[^h559], I do remember[^h2142] my faults[^h2399] this day[^h3117]:
###### 10
Pharaoh[^h6547] was wroth[^h7107] with his servants[^h5650], and put[^h5414] me in ward[^h4929] in the captain[^h8269] of the guard's[^h2876] house[^h1004], both me and the chief[^h8269] baker[^h644]:
###### 11
And we dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472] in one[^h259] night[^h3915], I and he; we dreamed[^h2492] each man[^h376] according to the interpretation[^h6623] of his dream[^h2472].
###### 12
And there was there with us a young man[^h5288], an Hebrew[^h5680], servant[^h5650] to the captain[^h8269] of the guard[^h2876]; and we told[^h5608] him, and he interpreted[^h6622] to us our dreams[^h2472]; to each man[^h376] according to his dream[^h2472] he did interpret[^h6622].
###### 13
And it came to pass, as he interpreted[^h6622] to us, so it was; me he restored[^h7725] unto mine office[^h3653], and him he hanged[^h8518].
###### 14
Then Pharaoh[^h6547] sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] Joseph[^h3130], and they brought him hastily[^h7323] out of the dungeon[^h953]: and he shaved[^h1548] himself, and changed[^h2498] his raiment[^h8071], and came in[^h935] unto Pharaoh[^h6547]. 
###### 15
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], I have dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472], and there is none that can interpret[^h6622] it: and I have heard[^h8085] say[^h559] of thee, that thou canst understand[^h8085] a dream[^h2472] to interpret[^h6622] it. 
###### 16
And Joseph[^h3130] answered[^h6030] Pharaoh[^h6547], saying[^h559], It is not in me[^h1107]: God[^h430] shall give[^h6030] Pharaoh[^h6547] an answer[^h6030] of peace[^h7965].
###### 17
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h1696] unto Joseph[^h3130], In my dream[^h2472], behold, I stood[^h5975] upon the bank[^h8193] of the river[^h2975]:
###### 18
And, behold, there came up[^h5927] out of the river[^h2975] seven[^h7651] kine[^h6510], fatfleshed[^h1277] [^h1320] and well[^h3303] favoured[^h8389]; and they fed[^h7462] in a meadow[^h260]:
###### 19
And, behold, seven[^h7651] other[^h312] kine[^h6510] came up[^h5927] after them[^h310], poor[^h1803] and very[^h3966] ill[^h7451] favoured[^h8389] and leanfleshed[^h7534] [^h1320], such[^h2007] as I never[^h3808] saw[^h7200] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] for badness[^h7455]:
###### 20
And the lean[^h7534] and the ill favoured[^h7451] kine[^h6510] did eat up[^h398] the first[^h7223] seven[^h7651] fat[^h1277] kine[^h6510]:
###### 21
And when they had eaten them up[^h935] [^h7130], it could not be known[^h3045] that they had eaten them[^h935] [^h7130]; but they were still[^h4758] ill favoured[^h7451], as at the beginning[^h8462]. So I awoke[^h3364]. 
###### 22
And I saw[^h7200] in my dream[^h2472], and, behold, seven[^h7651] ears[^h7641] came up[^h5927] in one[^h259] stalk[^h7070], full[^h4392] and good[^h2896]:
###### 23
And, behold, seven[^h7651] ears[^h7641], withered[^h6798], thin[^h1851], and blasted[^h7710] with the east wind[^h6921], sprung up[^h6779] after them[^h310]: 
###### 24
And the thin[^h1851] ears[^h7641] devoured[^h1104] the seven[^h7651] good[^h2896] ears[^h7641]: and I told[^h559] this unto the magicians[^h2748]; but there was none that could declare[^h5046] it to me.
###### 25
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], The dream[^h2472] of Pharaoh[^h6547] is one[^h259]: God[^h430] hath shewed[^h5046] Pharaoh[^h6547] what he is about to do[^h6213].
###### 26
The seven[^h7651] good[^h2896] kine[^h6510] are seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]; and the seven[^h7651] good[^h2896] ears[^h7641] are seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]: the dream[^h2472] is one[^h259].
###### 27
And the seven[^h7651] thin[^h7534] and ill favoured[^h7451] kine[^h6510] that came up[^h5927] after them[^h310] are seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]; and the seven[^h7651] empty[^h7386] ears[^h7641] blasted[^h7710] with the east wind[^h6921] shall be seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of famine[^h7458].
###### 28
This is the thing[^h1697] which I have spoken[^h1696] unto Pharaoh[^h6547]: What God[^h430] is about to do[^h6213] he sheweth[^h7200] unto Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 29
Behold, there come[^h935] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of great[^h1419] plenty[^h7647] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 30
And there shall arise[^h6965] after them[^h310] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of famine[^h7458]; and all the plenty[^h7647] shall be forgotten[^h7911] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; and the famine[^h7458] shall consume[^h3615] the land[^h776];
###### 31
And the plenty[^h7647] shall not be known[^h3045] in the land[^h776] by reason[^h6440] of that famine[^h7458] following[^h310] [^h3651]; for it shall be very[^h3966] grievous[^h3515]. 
###### 32
And for that the dream[^h2472] was doubled[^h8138] unto Pharaoh[^h6547] twice[^h6471]; it is because the thing[^h1697] is established[^h3559] by[^h5973] God[^h430], and God[^h430] will shortly[^h4116] bring it to pass[^h6213]. 
###### 33
Now therefore let Pharaoh[^h6547] look out[^h7200] a man[^h376] discreet[^h995] and wise[^h2450], and set[^h7896] him over the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 34
Let Pharaoh[^h6547] do[^h6213] this, and let him appoint[^h6485] officers[^h6496] over the land[^h776], and take up the fifth part[^h2567] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] in the seven[^h7651] plenteous[^h7647] years[^h8141]. 
###### 35
And let them gather[^h6908] all the food[^h400] of those good[^h2896] years[^h8141] that come[^h935], and lay up[^h6651] corn[^h1250] under the hand[^h3027] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and let them keep[^h8104] food[^h400] in the cities[^h5892].
###### 36
And that food[^h400] shall be for store[^h6487] to the land[^h776] against the seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of famine[^h7458], which shall be in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; that the land[^h776] perish[^h3772] not through the famine[^h7458]. 
###### 37
And the thing[^h1697] was good[^h3190] in the eyes[^h5869] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and in the eyes[^h5869] of all his servants[^h5650].
###### 38
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Can we find[^h4672] such a one as this[^h2088] is, a man[^h376] in whom[^h834] the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] is?
###### 39
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], Forasmuch[^h310] as God[^h430] hath shewed[^h3045] thee all this, there is none so discreet[^h995] and wise[^h2450] as thou art:
###### 40
Thou shalt be[^h1961] over my house[^h1004], and according unto thy word[^h6310] shall all my people[^h5971] be ruled[^h5401]: only in the throne[^h3678] will I be greater[^h1431] than thou. 
###### 41
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], See[^h7200], I have set[^h5414] thee over all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 42
And Pharaoh[^h6547] took off[^h5493] his ring[^h2885] from his hand[^h3027], and put[^h5414] it upon Joseph's[^h3130] hand[^h3027], and arrayed[^h3847] him in vestures[^h899] of fine linen[^h8336], and put[^h7760] a gold[^h2091] chain[^h7242] about his neck[^h6677]; 
###### 43
And he made him to ride[^h7392] in the second[^h4932] chariot[^h4818] which he had; and they cried[^h7121] before him[^h6440], Bow the knee[^h86]: and he made[^h5414] him ruler over all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 44
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], I am Pharaoh[^h6547], and without[^h1107] thee shall no man[^h376] lift up[^h7311] his hand[^h3027] or foot[^h7272] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 45
And Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] Joseph's[^h3130] name[^h8034] Zaphnathpaaneah[^h6847]; and he gave[^h5414] him to wife[^h802] Asenath[^h621] the daughter[^h1323] of Potipherah[^h6319] priest[^h3548] of On[^h204]. And Joseph[^h3130] went out[^h3318] over all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].  
###### 46
And Joseph[^h3130] was thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714]. And Joseph[^h3130] went out[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and went throughout[^h5674] all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 47
And in the seven[^h7651] plenteous[^h7647] years[^h8141] the earth[^h776] brought forth[^h6213] by handfuls[^h7062].
###### 48
And he gathered up[^h6908] all the food[^h400] of the seven[^h7651] years[^h8141], which were in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and laid up[^h5414] the food[^h400] in the cities[^h5892]: the food[^h400] of the field[^h7704], which was round about[^h5439] every city[^h5892], laid he up[^h5414] in the same[^h8432].
###### 49
And Joseph[^h3130] gathered[^h6651] corn[^h1250] as the sand[^h2344] of the sea[^h3220], very[^h3966] much[^h7235], until he left[^h2308] numbering[^h5608]; for it was without[^h369] number[^h4557].
###### 50
And unto Joseph[^h3130] were born[^h3205] two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] before the years[^h8141] of famine[^h7458] came[^h935], which Asenath[^h621] the daughter[^h1323] of Potipherah[^h6319] priest[^h3548] of On[^h204] bare[^h3205] unto him. 
###### 51
And Joseph[^h3130] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the firstborn[^h1060] Manasseh[^h4519]: For God[^h430], said he, hath made me forget[^h5382] all my toil[^h5999], and all my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]. 
###### 52
And the name[^h8034] of the second[^h8145] called[^h7121] he Ephraim[^h669]: For God[^h430] hath caused me to be fruitful[^h6509] in the land[^h776] of my affliction[^h6040]. 
###### 53
And the seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of plenteousness[^h7647], that was in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], were ended[^h3615].
###### 54
And the seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] of dearth[^h7458] began[^h2490] to come[^h935], according as Joseph[^h3130] had said[^h559]: and the dearth[^h7458] was in all lands[^h776]; but in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] there was bread[^h3899].
###### 55
And when all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] was famished[^h7456], the people[^h5971] cried[^h6817] to Pharaoh[^h6547] for bread[^h3899]: and Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto all the Egyptians[^h4714], Go[^h3212] unto Joseph[^h3130]; what he saith[^h559] to you, do[^h6213].
###### 56
And the famine[^h7458] was over all the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h776]: And Joseph[^h3130] opened[^h6605] all the storehouses, and sold[^h7666] unto the Egyptians[^h4714]; and the famine[^h7458] waxed sore[^h2388] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 57
And all countries[^h776] came[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714] to Joseph[^h3130] for to buy[^h7666] corn; because that the famine[^h7458] was so sore[^h2388] in all lands[^h776].

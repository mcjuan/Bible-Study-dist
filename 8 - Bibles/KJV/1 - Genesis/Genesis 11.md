###### 1
And the whole earth[^h776] was of one[^h259] language[^h8193], and of one[^h259] speech[^h1697].  
###### 2
And it came to pass, as they journeyed[^h5265] from the east[^h6924], that they found[^h4672] a plain[^h1237] in the land[^h776] of Shinar[^h8152]; and they dwelt[^h3427] there. 
###### 3
And they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], Go to[^h3051], let us make[^h3835] brick[^h3843], and burn[^h8313] them throughly[^h8316]. And they had brick[^h3843] for stone[^h68], and slime[^h2564] had[^h1961] they for morter[^h2563].  
###### 4
And they said[^h559], Go to[^h3051], let us build[^h1129] us a city[^h5892] and a tower[^h4026], whose top[^h7218] may reach unto heaven[^h8064]; and let us make[^h6213] us a name[^h8034], lest we be scattered abroad[^h6327] upon the face[^h6440] of the whole earth[^h776].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] came down[^h3381] to see[^h7200] the city[^h5892] and the tower[^h4026], which the children[^h1121] of men[^h120] builded[^h1129].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Behold, the people[^h5971] is one[^h259], and they have all one[^h259] language[^h8193]; and this they begin[^h2490] to do[^h6213]: and now nothing[^h3808] [^h3605] will be restrained[^h1219] from them, which they have imagined[^h2161] to do[^h6213].
###### 7
Go to[^h3051], let us go down[^h3381], and there confound[^h1101] their language[^h8193], that[^h834] they may not understand[^h8085] one[^h376] another's[^h7453] speech[^h8193].
###### 8
So the LORD[^h3068] scattered them abroad[^h6327] from thence[^h8033] upon the face[^h6440] of all the earth[^h776]: and they left off[^h2308] to build[^h1129] the city[^h5892].
###### 9
Therefore is the name of it[^h8034] called[^h7121] Babel[^h894]; because the LORD[^h3068] did there confound[^h1101] the language[^h8193] of all the earth[^h776]: and from thence did[^h6327] the LORD[^h3068] scatter them abroad[^h6327] upon the face[^h6440] of all the earth[^h776]. 
###### 10

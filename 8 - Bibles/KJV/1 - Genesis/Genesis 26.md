###### 1
And there was a famine[^h7458] in the land[^h776], beside[^h905] the first[^h7223] famine[^h7458] that was in the days[^h3117] of Abraham[^h85]. And Isaac[^h3327] went[^h3212] unto Abimelech[^h40] king[^h4428] of the Philistines[^h6430] unto Gerar[^h1642].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto him, and said[^h559], Go not down[^h3381] into Egypt[^h4714]; dwell[^h7931] in the land[^h776] which I shall tell[^h559] thee of:
###### 3
Sojourn[^h1481] in this land[^h776], and I will be with thee, and will bless[^h1288] thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed[^h2233], I will give[^h5414] all these[^h411] countries[^h776], and I will perform[^h6965] the oath[^h7621] which I sware[^h7650] unto Abraham[^h85] thy father[^h1];
###### 4
And I will make[^h7235] thy seed[^h2233] to multiply[^h7235] as the stars[^h3556] of heaven[^h8064], and will give[^h5414] unto thy seed[^h2233] all these[^h411] countries[^h776]; and in thy seed[^h2233] shall all the nations[^h1471] of the earth[^h776] be blessed[^h1288];
###### 5
Because[^h6118] that Abraham[^h85] obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], and kept[^h8104] my charge[^h4931], my commandments[^h4687], my statutes[^h2708], and my laws[^h8451].
###### 6
And Isaac[^h3327] dwelt[^h3427] in Gerar[^h1642]:
###### 7
And the men[^h582] of the place[^h4725] asked[^h7592] him of his wife[^h802]; and he said[^h559], She is my sister[^h269]: for he feared[^h3372] to say[^h559], She is my wife[^h802]; lest, said he, the men[^h582] of the place[^h4725] should kill[^h2026] me for Rebekah[^h7259]; because she was fair[^h2896] to look upon[^h4758].
###### 8
And it came to pass, when he had been there a long[^h748] time[^h3117], that Abimelech[^h40] king[^h4428] of the Philistines[^h6430] looked out[^h8259] at[^h1157] a window[^h2474], and saw[^h7200], and, behold, Isaac[^h3327] was sporting[^h6711] with Rebekah[^h7259] his wife[^h802].
###### 9
And Abimelech[^h40] called[^h7121] Isaac[^h3327], and said[^h559], Behold, of a surety[^h389] she is thy wife[^h802]: and how saidst[^h559] thou, She is my sister[^h269]? And Isaac[^h3327] said[^h559] unto him, Because I said[^h559], Lest I die[^h4191] for her.
###### 10
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559], What is this thou hast done[^h6213] unto us? one[^h259] of the people[^h5971] might lightly[^h4592] have lien[^h7901] with thy wife[^h802], and thou shouldest have brought[^h935] guiltiness[^h817] upon us.
###### 11
And Abimelech[^h40] charged[^h6680] all his people[^h5971], saying[^h559], He that toucheth[^h5060] this man[^h376] or his wife[^h802] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 12
Then Isaac[^h3327] sowed[^h2232] in that land[^h776], and received[^h4672] in the same year[^h8141] an hundredfold[^h3967] [^h8180]: and the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] him. 
###### 13
And the man[^h376] waxed great[^h1431], and went[^h3212] forward[^h1980], and grew[^h1432] until he became[^h1431] very[^h3966] great[^h1431]: 
###### 14
For he had possession[^h4735] of flocks[^h6629], and possession[^h4735] of herds[^h1241], and great store[^h7227] of servants[^h5657]: and the Philistines[^h6430] envied[^h7065] him. 
###### 15
For all the wells[^h875] which his father's[^h1] servants[^h5650] had digged[^h2658] in the days[^h3117] of Abraham[^h85] his father[^h1], the Philistines[^h6430] had stopped[^h5640] them, and filled[^h4390] them with earth[^h6083].
###### 16
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559] unto Isaac[^h3327], Go[^h3212] from us; for thou art much[^h3966] mightier[^h6105] than we.
###### 17
And Isaac[^h3327] departed[^h3212] thence, and pitched his tent[^h2583] in the valley[^h5158] of Gerar[^h1642], and dwelt[^h3427] there[^h8033].
###### 18
And Isaac[^h3327] digged[^h2658] again[^h7725] the wells[^h875] of water[^h4325], which they had digged[^h2658] in the days[^h3117] of Abraham[^h85] his father[^h1]; for the Philistines[^h6430] had stopped[^h5640] them after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Abraham[^h85]: and he called[^h7121] their names[^h8034] after the names[^h8034] by which[^h834] his father[^h1] had called[^h7121] them.
###### 19
And Isaac's[^h3327] servants[^h5650] digged[^h2658] in the valley[^h5158], and found[^h4672] there a well[^h875] of springing[^h2416] water[^h4325]. 
###### 20
And the herdmen[^h7462] of Gerar[^h1642] did strive[^h7378] with Isaac's[^h3327] herdmen[^h7462], saying[^h559], The water[^h4325] is ours: and he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the well[^h875] Esek[^h6230]; because they strove[^h6229] with him. 
###### 21
And they digged[^h2658] another[^h312] well[^h875], and strove[^h7378] for that also: and he called[^h7121] the name of it[^h8034] Sitnah[^h7856]. 
###### 22
And he removed[^h6275] from thence, and digged[^h2658] another[^h312] well[^h875]; and for that they strove[^h7378] not: and he called[^h7121] the name of it[^h8034] Rehoboth[^h7344]; and he said[^h559], For now[^h6258] the LORD[^h3068] hath made room[^h7337] for us, and we shall be fruitful[^h6509] in the land[^h776]. 
###### 23
And he went up[^h5927] from thence to Beersheba[^h884].
###### 24
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto him the same night[^h3915], and said[^h559], I am the God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85] thy father[^h1]: fear[^h3372] not, for I am with[^h854] thee, and will bless[^h1288] thee, and multiply[^h7235] thy seed[^h2233] for my servant[^h5650] Abraham's[^h85] sake.
###### 25
And he builded[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] there, and called[^h7121] upon the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], and pitched[^h5186] his tent[^h168] there: and there Isaac's[^h3327] servants[^h5650] digged[^h3738] a well[^h875].
###### 26
Then Abimelech[^h40] went[^h1980] to him from Gerar[^h1642], and Ahuzzath[^h276] one of his friends[^h4828], and Phichol[^h6369] the chief captain[^h8269] of his army[^h6635].
###### 27
And Isaac[^h3327] said[^h559] unto them, Wherefore[^h4069] come[^h935] ye to me, seeing ye hate[^h8130] me, and have sent me away[^h7971] from you?
###### 28
And they said[^h559], We saw[^h7200] certainly[^h7200] that the LORD[^h3068] was with thee: and we said[^h559], Let there be now an oath[^h423] betwixt[^h996] us, even betwixt[^h996] us and thee, and let us make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with thee; 
###### 29
That thou wilt do[^h6213] us no hurt[^h7451], as we have not touched[^h5060] thee, and as we have done[^h6213] unto thee nothing but[^h7535] good[^h2896], and have sent thee away[^h7971] in peace[^h7965]: thou art now[^h6258] the blessed[^h1288] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 30
And he made[^h6213] them a feast[^h4960], and they did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354].
###### 31
And they rose up betimes[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and sware[^h7650] one[^h376] to another[^h251]: and Isaac[^h3327] sent them away[^h7971], and they departed[^h3212] from him in peace[^h7965].
###### 32
And it came to pass the same day[^h3117], that Isaac's[^h3327] servants[^h5650] came[^h935], and told[^h5046] him concerning[^h182] the well[^h875] which they had digged[^h2658], and said[^h559] unto him, We have found[^h4672] water[^h4325].
###### 33
And he called[^h7121] it Shebah[^h7656]: therefore the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] is Beersheba[^h884] unto this day[^h3117].  
###### 34
And Esau[^h6215] was forty[^h705] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he took[^h3947] to wife[^h802] Judith[^h3067] the daughter[^h1323] of Beeri[^h882] the Hittite[^h2850], and Bashemath[^h1315] the daughter[^h1323] of Elon[^h356] the Hittite[^h2850]:
###### 35
Which were a grief[^h4786] of mind[^h7307] unto Isaac[^h3327] and to Rebekah[^h7259].

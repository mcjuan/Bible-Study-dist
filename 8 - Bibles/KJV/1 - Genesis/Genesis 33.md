###### 1
And Jacob[^h3290] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and, behold, Esau[^h6215] came[^h935], and with him four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]. And he divided[^h2673] the children[^h3206] unto Leah[^h3812], and unto Rachel[^h7354], and unto the two[^h8147] handmaids[^h8198].
###### 2
And he put[^h7760] the handmaids[^h8198] and their children[^h3206] foremost[^h7223], and Leah[^h3812] and her children[^h3206] after[^h314], and Rachel[^h7354] and Joseph[^h3130] hindermost[^h314].
###### 3
And he passed over[^h5674] before them[^h6440], and bowed himself[^h7812] to the ground[^h776] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471], until he came near[^h5066] to his brother[^h251].
###### 4
And Esau[^h6215] ran[^h7323] to meet him[^h7125], and embraced[^h2263] him, and fell[^h5307] on his neck[^h6677], and kissed him[^h5401]: and they wept[^h1058].
###### 5
And he lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] the women[^h802] and the children[^h3206]; and said[^h559], Who are those[^h428] with thee? And he said[^h559], The children[^h3206] which God[^h430] hath graciously given[^h2603] thy servant[^h5650]. 
###### 6
Then the handmaidens[^h8198] came near[^h5066], they and their children[^h3206], and they bowed themselves[^h7812].
###### 7
And Leah[^h3812] also with her children[^h3206] came near[^h5066], and bowed themselves[^h7812]: and after[^h310] came[^h5066] Joseph[^h3130] near[^h5066] and Rachel[^h7354], and they bowed[^h7812] themselves.
###### 8
And he said[^h559], What meanest thou by all this drove[^h4264] which I met[^h6298]? And he said[^h559], These are to find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of my lord[^h113]. 
###### 9
And Esau[^h6215] said[^h559], I have[^h3426] enough[^h7227], my brother[^h251]; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 
###### 10
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559], Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], then receive[^h3947] my present[^h4503] at my hand[^h3027]: for therefore I have seen[^h7200] thy face[^h6440], as though I had seen[^h7200] the face[^h6440] of God[^h430], and thou wast pleased with me[^h7521].
###### 11
Take[^h3947], I pray thee, my blessing[^h1293] that is brought[^h935] to thee; because God[^h430] hath dealt graciously with me[^h2603], and because[^h3605] I have[^h3426] enough[^h3605]. And he urged[^h6484] him, and he took[^h3947] it. 
###### 12
And he said[^h559], Let us take our journey[^h5265], and let us go[^h3212], and I will go[^h3212] before thee.
###### 13
And he said[^h559] unto him, My lord[^h113] knoweth[^h3045] that the children[^h3206] are tender[^h7390], and the flocks[^h6629] and herds[^h1241] with young[^h5763] are with me: and if men should overdrive[^h1849] them one[^h259] day[^h3117], all the flock[^h6629] will die[^h4191].
###### 14
Let my lord[^h113], I pray thee, pass over[^h5674] before[^h6440] his servant[^h5650]: and I will lead on[^h5095] softly[^h328], according as[^h7272] the cattle[^h4399] that goeth before me[^h6440] and the children[^h3206] be able to endure[^h7272], until I come[^h935] unto my lord[^h113] unto Seir[^h8165]. 
###### 15
And Esau[^h6215] said[^h559], Let me now leave[^h3322] with thee some of the folk[^h5971] that are with me. And he said[^h559], What[^h4100] needeth it? let me find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of my lord[^h113].  
###### 16
So Esau[^h6215] returned[^h7725] that day[^h3117] on his way[^h1870] unto Seir[^h8165].
###### 17
And Jacob[^h3290] journeyed[^h5265] to Succoth[^h5523], and built[^h1129] him an house[^h1004], and made[^h6213] booths[^h5521] for his cattle[^h4735]: therefore the name[^h8034] of the place[^h4725] is called[^h7121] Succoth[^h5523]. 
###### 18
And Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] to Shalem[^h8004], a city[^h5892] of Shechem[^h7927], which is in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], when he came[^h935] from Padanaram[^h6307]; and pitched his tent[^h2583] before[^h6440] the city[^h5892]. 
###### 19
And he bought[^h7069] a parcel[^h2513] of a field[^h7704], where he had spread[^h5186] his tent[^h168], at the hand[^h3027] of the children[^h1121] of Hamor[^h2544], Shechem's[^h7927] father[^h1], for an hundred[^h3967] pieces of money[^h7192].  
###### 20
And he erected[^h5324] there an altar[^h4196], and called it[^h7121] Elelohe-Israel[^h415].

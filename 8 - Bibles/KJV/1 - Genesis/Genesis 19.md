###### 1
And there came[^h935] two[^h8147] angels[^h4397] to Sodom[^h5467] at even[^h6153]; and Lot[^h3876] sat[^h3427] in the gate[^h8179] of Sodom[^h5467]: and Lot[^h3876] seeing[^h7200] them rose up[^h6965] to meet[^h7125] them; and he bowed[^h7812] himself with his face[^h639] toward the ground[^h776];
###### 2
And he said[^h559], Behold now, my lords[^h113], turn in[^h5493], I pray you, into your servant's[^h5650] house[^h1004], and tarry all night[^h3885], and wash[^h7364] your feet[^h7272], and ye shall rise up early[^h7925], and go[^h1980] on your ways[^h1870]. And they said[^h559], Nay; but we will abide[^h3885] in the street[^h7339] all night[^h3885].
###### 3
And he pressed[^h6484] upon them greatly[^h3966]; and they turned in[^h5493] unto him, and entered[^h935] into his house[^h1004]; and he made[^h6213] them a feast[^h4960], and did bake[^h644] unleavened bread[^h4682], and they did eat[^h398].
###### 4
But before they lay down[^h7901], the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892], even the men[^h582] of Sodom[^h5467], compassed[^h5437] the house[^h1004] round[^h5437], both old[^h2205] and young[^h5288], all the people[^h5971] from every quarter[^h7097]:
###### 5
And they called[^h7121] unto Lot[^h3876], and said[^h559] unto him, Where are the men[^h582] which came in[^h935] to thee this night[^h3915]? bring them out[^h3318] unto us, that we may know[^h3045] them.
###### 6
And Lot[^h3876] went out[^h3318] at the door[^h6607] unto them, and shut[^h5462] the door[^h1817] after him[^h310],
###### 7
And said[^h559], I pray you, brethren[^h251], do not so wickedly[^h7489].
###### 8
Behold now, I have two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323] which have not known[^h3045] man[^h376]; let me, I pray you, bring them out[^h3318] unto you, and do[^h6213] ye to them as is good[^h2896] in your eyes[^h5869]: only unto these[^h411] men[^h582] do[^h6213] nothing[^h408] [^h1697]; for therefore came[^h935] they under the shadow[^h6738] of my roof[^h6982].
###### 9
And they said[^h559], Stand[^h5066] back[^h1973]. And they said[^h559] again, This one[^h259] fellow came in[^h935] to sojourn[^h1481], and he will needs[^h8199] be a judge[^h8199]: now will we deal worse[^h7489] with thee, than with them. And they pressed[^h6484] sore[^h3966] upon the man[^h376], even Lot[^h3876], and came near[^h5066] to break[^h7665] the door[^h1817].
###### 10
But the men[^h582] put forth[^h7971] their hand[^h3027], and pulled[^h935] Lot[^h3876] into the house[^h1004] to them, and shut[^h5462] to the door[^h1817].
###### 11
And they smote[^h5221] the men[^h582] that were at the door[^h6607] of the house[^h1004] with blindness[^h5575], both small[^h6996] and great[^h1419]: so that they wearied[^h3811] themselves to find[^h4672] the door[^h6607].
###### 12
And the men[^h582] said[^h559] unto Lot[^h3876], Hast thou here[^h6311] any[^h4310] besides? son in law[^h2860], and thy sons[^h1121], and thy daughters[^h1323], and whatsoever[^h834] thou hast in the city[^h5892], bring them out[^h3318] of this place[^h4725]:
###### 13
For we[^h587] will destroy[^h7843] [^h853] this place[^h4725], because the cry of them[^h6818] is waxen great[^h1431] before[^h854] the face[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] us to destroy[^h7843] it.
###### 14
And Lot[^h3876] went out[^h3318], and spake[^h1696] unto his sons in law[^h2860], which married[^h3947] his daughters[^h1323], and said[^h559], Up[^h6965], get you out[^h3318] of this place[^h4725]; for the LORD[^h3068] will destroy[^h7843] this city[^h5892]. But he seemed as one that mocked[^h6711] unto[^h5869] his sons in law[^h2860].
###### 15
And when[^h3644] the morning[^h7837] arose[^h5927], then the angels[^h4397] hastened[^h213] Lot[^h3876], saying[^h559], Arise[^h6965], take[^h3947] thy wife[^h802], and thy two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323], which are here[^h4672]; lest thou be consumed[^h5595] in the iniquity[^h5771] of the city[^h5892].  
###### 16
And while he lingered[^h4102], the men[^h582] laid hold[^h2388] upon his hand[^h3027], and upon the hand[^h3027] of his wife[^h802], and upon the hand[^h3027] of his two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323]; the LORD[^h3068] being merciful[^h2551] unto him: and they brought him forth[^h3318], and set him[^h3240] without[^h2351] the city[^h5892].
###### 17
And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth[^h3318] abroad[^h2351], that he said[^h559], Escape[^h4422] for[^h5921] thy life[^h5315]; look[^h5027] not behind thee[^h310], neither stay[^h5975] thou in all the plain[^h3603]; escape[^h4422] to the mountain[^h2022], lest thou be consumed[^h5595].
###### 18
And Lot[^h3876] said[^h559] unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord[^h113]:
###### 19
Behold now, thy servant[^h5650] hath found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], and thou hast magnified[^h1431] thy mercy[^h2617], which thou hast shewed[^h6213] unto me[^h5978] in saving[^h2421] my life[^h5315]; and I cannot[^h3201] escape[^h4422] to the mountain[^h2022], lest some evil[^h7451] take[^h1692] me, and I die[^h4191]:
###### 20
Behold now, this city[^h5892] is near[^h7138] to flee[^h5127] unto, and it[^h1931] is a little one[^h4705]: Oh, let me escape[^h4422] thither, ( is it not a little one[^h4705]?) and my soul[^h5315] shall live[^h2421].
###### 21
And he said[^h559] unto him, See[^h2009], I have accepted[^h5375] thee[^h6440] concerning this thing[^h1697] also, that I will not overthrow[^h2015] this city[^h5892], for the which[^h834] thou hast spoken[^h1696]. 
###### 22
Haste[^h4116] thee, escape[^h4422] thither; for I cannot[^h3201] do[^h6213] any thing[^h1697] till thou be come[^h935] thither. Therefore the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] was called[^h7121] Zoar[^h6820]. 
###### 23
The sun[^h8121] was risen[^h3318] upon the earth[^h776] when Lot[^h3876] entered[^h935] into Zoar[^h6820]. 
###### 24
Then the LORD[^h3068] rained[^h4305] upon Sodom[^h5467] and upon Gomorrah[^h6017] brimstone[^h1614] and fire[^h784] from the LORD[^h3068] out of heaven[^h8064];
###### 25
And he overthrew[^h2015] those[^h411] cities[^h5892], and all the plain[^h3603], and all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the cities[^h5892], and that which grew[^h6780] upon the ground[^h127].
###### 26
But his wife[^h802] looked back[^h5027] from behind him[^h310], and she became a pillar[^h5333] of salt[^h4417].
###### 27
And Abraham[^h85] gat up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242] to the place[^h4725] where he stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 28
And he looked[^h8259] toward[^h6440] Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017], and toward[^h6440] all the land[^h776] of the plain[^h3603], and beheld[^h7200], and, lo, the smoke[^h7008] of the country[^h776] went up[^h5927] as the smoke[^h7008] of a furnace[^h3536].
###### 29
And it came to pass, when God[^h430] destroyed[^h7843] the cities[^h5892] of the plain[^h3603], that God[^h430] remembered[^h2142] Abraham[^h85], and sent[^h7971] Lot[^h3876] out of the midst[^h8432] of the overthrow[^h2018], when he overthrew[^h2015] the cities[^h5892] in the which[^h2004] Lot[^h3876] dwelt[^h3427].
###### 30
And Lot[^h3876] went up[^h5927] out of Zoar[^h6820], and dwelt[^h3427] in the mountain[^h2022], and his two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323] with him; for he feared[^h3372] to dwell[^h3427] in Zoar[^h6820]: and he dwelt[^h3427] in a cave[^h4631], he and his two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323].
###### 31
And the firstborn[^h1067] said[^h559] unto the younger[^h6810], Our father[^h1] is old[^h2204], and there is not a man[^h376] in the earth[^h776] to come in[^h935] unto us after the manner[^h1870] of all the earth[^h776]:
###### 32
Come[^h3212], let us make[^h8248] our father[^h1] drink[^h8248] wine[^h3196], and we will lie[^h7901] with him, that we may preserve[^h2421] seed[^h2233] of our father[^h1].
###### 33
And they made[^h8248] their father[^h1] drink[^h8248] wine[^h3196] that night[^h3915]: and the firstborn[^h1067] went in[^h935], and lay[^h7901] with her father[^h1]; and he perceived[^h3045] not when she lay down[^h7901], nor when she arose[^h6965].
###### 34
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that the firstborn[^h1067] said[^h559] unto the younger[^h6810], Behold, I lay[^h7901] yesternight[^h570] with my father[^h1]: let us make him drink[^h8248] wine[^h3196] this night[^h3915] also; and go thou in[^h935], and lie[^h7901] with him, that we may preserve[^h2421] seed[^h2233] of our father[^h1].
###### 35
And they made[^h8248] their father[^h1] drink[^h8248] wine[^h3196] that[^h1931] night[^h3915] also: and the younger[^h6810] arose[^h6965], and lay[^h7901] with him; and he perceived[^h3045] not when she lay down[^h7901], nor when she arose[^h6965].
###### 36
Thus were both[^h8147] the daughters[^h1323] of Lot[^h3876] with child[^h2029] by their father[^h1].
###### 37
And the firstborn[^h1067] bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Moab[^h4124]: the same[^h1931] is the father[^h1] of the Moabites[^h4124] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 38
And the younger[^h6810], she also bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Benammi[^h1151]: the same is the father[^h1] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] unto this day[^h3117].

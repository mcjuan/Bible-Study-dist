###### 1
And it came to pass, when men[^h120] began[^h2490] to multiply[^h7231] on[^h5921] the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127], and daughters[^h1323] were born[^h3205] unto them,
###### 2
That the sons[^h1121] of God[^h430] saw[^h7200] the daughters[^h1323] of men[^h120] that they[^h2007] were fair[^h2896]; and they took[^h3947] them wives[^h802] of all which they chose[^h977].
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], My spirit[^h7307] shall not always[^h5769] strive[^h1777] with man[^h120], for that he also[^h1571] is flesh[^h1320] [^h7683]: yet his days[^h3117] shall be an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141].
###### 4
There were giants[^h5303] in the earth[^h776] in those days[^h3117]; and also after[^h310] that[^h3651], when[^h834] the sons[^h1121] of God[^h430] came in[^h935] unto the daughters[^h1323] of men[^h120], and they bare[^h3205] children to them, the same[^h1992] became mighty men[^h1368] which were of old[^h5769], men[^h582] of renown[^h8034].
###### 5
And GOD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] that the wickedness[^h7451] of man[^h120] was great[^h7227] in the earth[^h776], and that every imagination[^h3336] of the thoughts[^h4284] of his heart[^h3820] was only[^h7535] evil[^h7451] continually[^h3117].  
###### 6
And it repented[^h5162] the LORD[^h3068] that he had made[^h6213] man[^h120] on the earth[^h776], and it grieved[^h6087] him at[^h413] his heart[^h3820].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], I will destroy[^h4229] man[^h120] whom I have created[^h1254] from the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127]; both man[^h120], and[^h5704] beast[^h929], and the creeping thing[^h7431], and the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064]; for it repenteth[^h5162] me that I have made[^h6213] them. 
###### 8
But Noah[^h5146] found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
These are the generations[^h8435] of Noah[^h5146]: Noah[^h5146] was a just[^h6662] man[^h376] and perfect[^h8549] in his generations[^h1755], and Noah[^h5146] walked[^h1980] with God[^h430]. 
###### 10
And Noah[^h5146] begat[^h3205] three[^h7969] sons[^h1121], Shem[^h8035], Ham[^h2526], and Japheth[^h3315].
###### 11
The earth[^h776] also was corrupt[^h7843] before[^h6440] God[^h430], and the earth[^h776] was filled[^h4390] with violence[^h2555].
###### 12
And God[^h430] looked[^h7200] upon the earth[^h776], and, behold, it was corrupt[^h7843]; for all flesh[^h1320] had corrupted[^h7843] his way[^h1870] upon the earth[^h776].
###### 13
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Noah[^h5146], The end[^h7093] of all flesh[^h1320] is come[^h935] before me[^h6440]; for the earth[^h776] is filled with[^h4390] violence[^h2555] through them[^h6440]; and, behold, I will destroy[^h7843] them with[^h854] the earth[^h776]. 
###### 14
Make[^h6213] thee an ark[^h8392] of gopher[^h1613] wood[^h6086]; rooms[^h7064] shalt thou make[^h6213] in[^h854] the ark[^h8392], and shalt pitch[^h3722] it within[^h1004] and without[^h2351] with pitch[^h3724]. 
###### 15
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make[^h6213] it of: The length[^h753] of the ark[^h8392] shall be three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520], the breadth[^h7341] of it fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the height[^h6967] of it thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520].
###### 16
A window[^h6672] shalt thou make[^h6213] to the ark[^h8392], and in a cubit[^h520] shalt thou finish[^h3615] it above[^h4605]; and the door[^h6607] of the ark[^h8392] shalt thou set[^h7760] in the side thereof[^h6654]; with lower[^h8482], second[^h8145], and third[^h7992] stories shalt thou make[^h6213] it.
###### 17
And, behold[^h2009], I[^h589], even I, do bring[^h935] a flood[^h3999] of waters[^h4325] upon the earth[^h776], to destroy[^h7843] all flesh[^h1320], wherein is the breath[^h7307] of life[^h2416], from under[^h8478] heaven[^h8064]; and every thing[^h3605] that is in the earth[^h776] shall die[^h1478].
###### 18
But with thee will I establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285]; and thou shalt come[^h935] into[^h413] the ark[^h8392], thou[^h859], and thy sons[^h1121], and thy wife[^h802], and thy sons'[^h1121] wives[^h802] with thee.
###### 19
And of every living thing[^h2416] of all flesh[^h1320], two[^h8147] of every sort shalt thou bring[^h935] into the ark[^h8392], to keep them alive[^h2421] with thee; they shall be male[^h2145] and female[^h5347].
###### 20
Of fowls[^h5775] after their kind[^h4327], and of cattle[^h929] after their kind[^h4327], of every creeping thing[^h7431] of the earth[^h127] after his kind[^h4327], two[^h8147] of every sort shall come[^h935] unto thee, to keep them alive[^h2421].
###### 21
And take[^h3947] thou unto thee of all food[^h3978] that is eaten[^h398], and thou shalt gather[^h622] it to thee; and it shall be for food[^h402] for thee, and for them.
###### 22
Thus did[^h6213] Noah[^h5146]; according to all that God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] him, so did[^h6213] he.

###### 1
And Jacob[^h3290] called[^h7121] unto his sons[^h1121], and said[^h559], Gather yourselves together[^h622], that I may tell[^h5046] you that which shall befall[^h7122] you in the last[^h319] days[^h3117].
###### 2
Gather yourselves together[^h6908], and hear[^h8085], ye sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290]; and hearken[^h8085] unto Israel[^h3478] your father[^h1].
###### 3
Reuben[^h7205], thou art my firstborn[^h1060], my might[^h3581], and the beginning[^h7225] of my strength[^h202], the excellency[^h3499] of dignity[^h7613], and the excellency[^h3499] of power[^h5794]:
###### 4
Unstable[^h6349] as water[^h4325], thou shalt not excel[^h3498]; because thou wentest up[^h5927] to thy father's[^h1] bed[^h4904]; then defiledst thou[^h2490] it: he went up[^h5927] to my couch[^h3326].  
###### 5
Simeon[^h8095] and Levi[^h3878] are brethren[^h251]; instruments[^h3627] of cruelty[^h2555] are in their habitations[^h4380]. 
###### 6
O my soul[^h5315], come[^h935] not thou into their secret[^h5475]; unto their assembly[^h6951], mine honour[^h3519], be not thou united[^h3161]: for in their anger[^h639] they slew[^h2026] a man[^h376], and in their selfwill[^h7522] they digged down[^h6131] a wall[^h7794]. 
###### 7
Cursed[^h779] be their anger[^h639], for it was fierce[^h5794]; and their wrath[^h5678], for it was cruel[^h7185]: I will divide[^h2505] them in Jacob[^h3290], and scatter[^h6327] them in Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
Judah[^h3063], thou art he whom thy brethren[^h251] shall praise[^h3034]: thy hand[^h3027] shall be in the neck[^h6203] of thine enemies[^h341]; thy father's[^h1] children[^h1121] shall bow down[^h7812] before thee.
###### 9
Judah[^h3063] is a lion's[^h738] whelp[^h1482]: from the prey[^h2964], my son[^h1121], thou art gone up[^h5927]: he stooped down[^h3766], he couched[^h7257] as a lion[^h738], and as an old lion[^h3833]; who shall rouse him up[^h6965]?
###### 10
The sceptre[^h7626] shall not depart[^h5493] from Judah[^h3063], nor a lawgiver[^h2710] from between his feet[^h7272], until[^h3588] Shiloh[^h7886] come[^h935]; and unto him shall the gathering[^h3349] of the people[^h5971] be.
###### 11
Binding[^h631] his foal[^h5895] unto the vine[^h1612], and his ass's[^h860] colt[^h1121] unto the choice vine[^h8321]; he washed[^h3526] his garments[^h3830] in wine[^h3196], and his clothes[^h5497] in the blood[^h1818] of grapes[^h6025]:
###### 12
His eyes[^h5869] shall be red[^h2447] with wine[^h3196], and his teeth[^h8127] white[^h3836] with milk[^h2461].
###### 13
Zebulun[^h2074] shall dwell[^h7931] at the haven[^h2348] of the sea[^h3220]; and he shall be for an haven[^h2348] of ships[^h591]; and his border[^h3411] shall be unto Zidon[^h6721].
###### 14
Issachar[^h3485] is a strong[^h1634] ass[^h2543] couching down[^h7257] between two burdens[^h4942]:
###### 15
And he saw[^h7200] that rest[^h4496] was good[^h2896], and the land[^h776] that it was pleasant[^h5276]; and bowed[^h5186] his shoulder[^h7926] to bear[^h5445], and became a servant[^h5647] unto tribute[^h4522].
###### 16
Dan[^h1835] shall judge[^h1777] his people[^h5971], as one[^h259] of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 17
Dan[^h1835] shall be a serpent[^h5175] by the way[^h1870], an adder[^h8207] in the path[^h734], that biteth[^h5391] the horse[^h5483] heels[^h6119], so that his rider[^h7392] shall fall[^h5307] backward[^h268]. 
###### 18
I have waited for[^h6960] thy salvation[^h3444], O LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
Gad[^h1410], a troop[^h1416] shall overcome[^h1464] him: but he shall overcome[^h1464] at the last[^h6119].
###### 20
Out of Asher[^h836] his bread[^h3899] shall be fat[^h8082], and he shall yield[^h5414] royal[^h4428] dainties[^h4574].
###### 21
Naphtali[^h5321] is a hind[^h355] let loose[^h7971]: he giveth[^h5414] goodly[^h8233] words[^h561].
###### 22
Joseph[^h3130] is a fruitful[^h6509] bough[^h1121], even a fruitful[^h6509] bough[^h1121] by a well[^h5869]; whose branches[^h1323] run[^h6805] over the wall[^h7791]: 
###### 23
The archers[^h1167] [^h2671] have sorely grieved him[^h4843], and shot[^h7232] at him, and hated him[^h7852]:
###### 24
But his bow[^h7198] abode[^h3427] in strength[^h386], and the arms[^h2220] of his hands[^h3027] were made strong[^h6339] by the hands[^h3027] of the mighty[^h46] God of Jacob[^h3290]; (from thence is the shepherd[^h7462], the stone[^h68] of Israel[^h3478]:)
###### 25
Even by the God[^h410] of thy father[^h1], who shall help[^h5826] thee; and by[^h854] the Almighty[^h7706], who shall bless[^h1288] thee with blessings[^h1293] of heaven[^h8064] above[^h5920], blessings[^h1293] of the deep[^h8415] that lieth[^h7257] under, blessings[^h1293] of the breasts[^h7699], and of the womb[^h7356]:
###### 26
The blessings[^h1293] of thy father[^h1] have prevailed[^h1396] above the blessings[^h1293] of my progenitors[^h2029] unto the utmost bound[^h8379] of the everlasting[^h5769] hills[^h1389]: they shall be on the head[^h7218] of Joseph[^h3130], and on the crown of the head[^h6936] of him that was separate[^h5139] from his brethren[^h251].
###### 27
Benjamin[^h1144] shall ravin[^h2963] as a wolf[^h2061]: in the morning[^h1242] he shall devour[^h398] the prey[^h5706], and at night[^h6153] he shall divide[^h2505] the spoil[^h7998].
###### 28
All these are the twelve[^h6240] [^h8147] tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478]: and this is it that their father[^h1] spake[^h1696] unto them, and blessed[^h1288] them; every[^h834] one[^h376] according to his blessing[^h1293] he blessed[^h1288] them.
###### 29
And he charged[^h6680] them, and said[^h559] unto them, I am to be gathered[^h622] unto my people[^h5971]: bury[^h6912] me with my fathers[^h1] in the cave[^h4631] that is in the field[^h7704] of Ephron[^h6085] the Hittite[^h2850],
###### 30
In the cave[^h4631] that is in the field[^h7704] of Machpelah[^h4375], which is before[^h6440] Mamre[^h4471], in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], which Abraham[^h85] bought[^h7069] with the field[^h7704] of Ephron[^h6085] the Hittite[^h2850] for a possession[^h272] of a buryingplace[^h6913].
###### 31
There they buried[^h6912] Abraham[^h85] and Sarah[^h8283] his wife[^h802]; there they buried[^h6912] Isaac[^h3327] and Rebekah[^h7259] his wife[^h802]; and there I buried[^h6912] Leah[^h3812].
###### 32
The purchase[^h4735] of the field[^h7704] and of the cave[^h4631] that is therein was from the children[^h1121] of Heth[^h2845].
###### 33
And when Jacob[^h3290] had made an end[^h3615] of commanding[^h6680] his sons[^h1121], he gathered up[^h622] his feet[^h7272] into the bed[^h4296], and yielded up the ghost[^h1478], and was gathered[^h622] unto his people[^h5971].

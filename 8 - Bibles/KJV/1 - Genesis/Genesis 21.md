###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] visited[^h6485] Sarah[^h8283] as he had said[^h559], and the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] unto Sarah[^h8283] as he had spoken[^h1696].
###### 2
For Sarah[^h8283] conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] Abraham[^h85] a son[^h1121] in his old age[^h2208], at the set time[^h4150] of which God[^h430] had spoken[^h1696] to him.
###### 3
And Abraham[^h85] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of his son[^h1121] that was born[^h3205] unto him, whom Sarah[^h8283] bare[^h3205] to him, Isaac[^h3327].
###### 4
And Abraham[^h85] circumcised[^h4135] his son[^h1121] Isaac[^h3327] being eight[^h8083] days[^h3117] old[^h1121], as God[^h430] had commanded[^h6680] him.
###### 5
And Abraham[^h85] was an hundred[^h3967] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], when his son[^h1121] Isaac[^h3327] was born[^h3205] unto him.
###### 6
And Sarah[^h8283] said[^h559], God[^h430] hath made[^h6213] me to laugh[^h6712], so that all that hear[^h8085] will laugh[^h6711] with me.
###### 7
And she said[^h559], Who would have said[^h4448] unto Abraham[^h85], that Sarah[^h8283] should have given children[^h1121] suck[^h3243]? for I have born[^h3205] him a son[^h1121] in his old age[^h2208].
###### 8
And the child[^h3206] grew[^h1431], and was weaned[^h1580]: and Abraham[^h85] made[^h6213] a great[^h1419] feast[^h4960] the same day[^h3117] that Isaac[^h3327] was weaned[^h1580].
###### 9
And Sarah[^h8283] saw[^h7200] the son[^h1121] of Hagar[^h1904] the Egyptian[^h4713], which she had born[^h3205] unto Abraham[^h85], mocking[^h6711].
###### 10
Wherefore she said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], Cast out[^h1644] this bondwoman[^h519] and her son[^h1121]: for the son[^h1121] of this bondwoman[^h519] shall not be heir[^h3423] with my son[^h1121], even with Isaac[^h3327].
###### 11
And the thing[^h1697] was very[^h3966] grievous[^h3415] in Abraham's[^h85] sight[^h5869] because[^h182] of his son[^h1121].
###### 12
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], Let it not be grievous[^h3415] in thy sight[^h5869] because of the lad[^h5288], and because of thy bondwoman[^h519]; in all that Sarah[^h8283] hath said[^h559] unto thee, hearken[^h8085] unto her voice[^h6963]; for in Isaac[^h3327] shall thy seed[^h2233] be called[^h7121].
###### 13
And also of the son[^h1121] of the bondwoman[^h519] will I make[^h7760] a nation[^h1471], because he is thy seed[^h2233].
###### 14
And Abraham[^h85] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and took[^h3947] bread[^h3899], and a bottle[^h2573] of water[^h4325], and gave[^h5414] it unto Hagar[^h1904], putting[^h7760] it on her shoulder[^h7926], and the child[^h3206], and sent her away[^h7971]: and she departed[^h3212], and wandered[^h8582] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Beersheba[^h884].
###### 15
And the water[^h4325] was spent[^h3615] in[^h4480] the bottle[^h2573], and she cast[^h7993] the child[^h3206] under one[^h259] of the shrubs[^h7880].
###### 16
And she went[^h3212], and sat her down[^h3427] over against[^h5048] him a good way off[^h7368], as it were a bowshot[^h2909] [^h7198]: for she said[^h559], Let me not see[^h7200] the death[^h4194] of the child[^h3206]. And she sat[^h3427] over against him, and lift up[^h5375] her voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 17
And God[^h430] heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the lad[^h5288]; and the angel[^h4397] of God[^h430] called[^h7121] to Hagar[^h1904] out of heaven[^h8064], and said[^h559] unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar[^h1904]? fear[^h3372] not; for God[^h430] hath heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the lad[^h5288] where he is.
###### 18
Arise[^h6965], lift up[^h5375] the lad[^h5288], and hold[^h2388] him in thine hand[^h3027]; for I will make[^h7760] him a great[^h1419] nation[^h1471].
###### 19
And God[^h430] opened[^h6491] her eyes[^h5869], and she saw[^h7200] a well[^h875] of water[^h4325]; and she went[^h3212], and filled[^h4390] the bottle[^h2573] with water[^h4325], and gave[^h8248] the lad[^h5288] drink[^h8248].
###### 20
And God[^h430] was with the lad[^h5288]; and he grew[^h1431], and dwelt[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057], and became an archer[^h7235] [^h7199].
###### 21
And he dwelt[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Paran[^h6290]: and his mother[^h517] took[^h3947] him a wife[^h802] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 22
And it came to pass at that time[^h6256], that Abimelech[^h40] and Phichol[^h6369] the chief captain[^h8269] of his host[^h6635] spake[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], saying[^h559], God[^h430] is with thee in all that thou doest[^h6213]:
###### 23
Now therefore swear[^h7650] unto me here[^h2008] by God[^h430] that thou wilt not deal falsely[^h8266] with me, nor with my son[^h5209], nor with my son's son[^h5220]: but according to the kindness[^h2617] that I have done[^h6213] unto thee, thou shalt do[^h6213] unto me, and to the land[^h776] wherein thou hast sojourned[^h1481]. 
###### 24
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559], I will swear[^h7650].
###### 25
And Abraham[^h85] reproved[^h3198] Abimelech[^h40] because[^h182] of a well[^h875] of water[^h4325], which Abimelech's[^h40] servants[^h5650] had violently taken away[^h1497].
###### 26
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559], I wot[^h3045] not who hath done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]: neither[^h3808] didst thou tell[^h5046] me, neither[^h3808] yet heard[^h8085] I of it, but[^h1115] to day[^h3117].
###### 27
And Abraham[^h85] took[^h3947] sheep[^h6629] and oxen[^h1241], and gave[^h5414] them unto Abimelech[^h40]; and both of them[^h8147] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285].
###### 28
And Abraham[^h85] set[^h5324] seven[^h7651] ewe lambs[^h3535] of the flock[^h6629] by themselves.
###### 29
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], What[^h2008] mean these seven[^h7651] ewe lambs[^h3535] which thou hast set[^h5324] by themselves?
###### 30
And he said[^h559], For these seven[^h7651] ewe lambs[^h3535] shalt thou take[^h3947] of my hand[^h3027], that[^h5668] they may be a witness[^h5713] unto me, that I have digged[^h2658] this well[^h875].
###### 31
Wherefore he called[^h7121] that place[^h4725] Beersheba[^h884]; because there they sware[^h7650] both of them[^h8147]. 
###### 32
Thus they made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] at Beersheba[^h884]: then Abimelech[^h40] rose up[^h6965], and Phichol[^h6369] the chief captain[^h8269] of his host[^h6635], and they returned[^h7725] into the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 33
And Abraham planted[^h5193] a grove[^h815] in Beersheba[^h884], and called[^h7121] there on the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], the everlasting[^h5769] God[^h410]. 
###### 34
And Abraham[^h85] sojourned[^h1481] in the Philistines'[^h6430] land[^h776] many[^h7227] days[^h3117].

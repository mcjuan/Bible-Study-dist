###### 1
And Dinah[^h1783] the daughter[^h1323] of Leah[^h3812], which she bare[^h3205] unto Jacob[^h3290], went out[^h3318] to see[^h7200] the daughters[^h1323] of the land[^h776].
###### 2
And when Shechem[^h7927] the son[^h1121] of Hamor[^h2544] the Hivite[^h2340], prince[^h5387] of the country[^h776], saw[^h7200] her, he took[^h3947] her, and lay[^h7901] with her, and defiled her[^h6031]. 
###### 3
And his soul[^h5315] clave[^h1692] unto Dinah[^h1783] the daughter[^h1323] of Jacob[^h3290], and he loved[^h157] the damsel[^h5291], and spake[^h1696] kindly[^h3820] unto the damsel[^h5291]. 
###### 4
And Shechem[^h7927] spake[^h559] unto his father[^h1] Hamor[^h2544], saying[^h559], Get[^h3947] me this damsel[^h3207] to wife[^h802].
###### 5
And Jacob[^h3290] heard[^h8085] that he had defiled[^h2930] Dinah[^h1783] his daughter[^h1323]: now his sons[^h1121] were with his cattle[^h4735] in the field[^h7704]: and Jacob[^h3290] held his peace[^h2790] until they were come[^h935].
###### 6
And Hamor[^h2544] the father[^h1] of Shechem[^h7927] went out[^h3318] unto Jacob[^h3290] to commune[^h1696] with[^h854] him.
###### 7
And the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] out of the field[^h7704] when they heard[^h8085] it: and the men[^h582] were grieved[^h6087], and they were very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734], because he had wrought[^h6213] folly[^h5039] in Israel[^h3478] in lying[^h7901] with Jacob's[^h3290] daughter[^h1323]; which thing ought not to be done[^h6213].
###### 8
And Hamor[^h2544] communed[^h1696] with them, saying[^h559], The soul[^h5315] of my son[^h1121] Shechem[^h7927] longeth[^h2836] for your daughter[^h1323]: I pray you give[^h5414] her him to wife[^h802].
###### 9
And make ye marriages[^h2859] with us, and give[^h5414] your daughters[^h1323] unto us, and take[^h3947] our daughters[^h1323] unto you.
###### 10
And ye shall dwell[^h3427] with us: and the land[^h776] shall be[^h1961] before you[^h6440]; dwell[^h3427] and trade[^h5503] ye therein, and get you possessions[^h270] therein.
###### 11
And Shechem[^h7927] said[^h559] unto her father[^h1] and unto her brethren[^h251], Let me find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in your eyes[^h5869], and what ye shall say[^h559] unto me I will give[^h5414].
###### 12
Ask[^h7235] me never so much[^h3966] dowry[^h4119] and gift[^h4976], and I will give[^h5414] according as ye shall say[^h559] unto me: but give[^h5414] me the damsel[^h5291] to wife[^h802].
###### 13
And the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] answered[^h6030] Shechem[^h7927] and Hamor[^h2544] his father[^h1] deceitfully[^h4820], and said[^h1696], because he had defiled[^h2930] Dinah[^h1783] their sister[^h269]:
###### 14
And they said[^h559] unto them, We cannot[^h3808] [^h3201] do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], to give[^h5414] our sister[^h269] to one[^h376] that is uncircumcised[^h6190]; for that were a reproach[^h2781] unto us:
###### 15
But in this[^h2063] will we consent[^h225] unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male[^h2145] of you be circumcised[^h4135];
###### 16
Then will we give[^h5414] our daughters[^h1323] unto you, and we will take[^h3947] your daughters[^h1323] to us, and we will dwell[^h3427] with you, and we will become one[^h259] people[^h5971].
###### 17
But if ye will not hearken[^h8085] unto us, to be circumcised[^h4135]; then will we take[^h3947] our daughter[^h1323], and we will be gone[^h1980].
###### 18
And their words[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] Hamor[^h2544], and Shechem[^h7927] Hamor's[^h2544] son[^h1121].
###### 19
And the young man[^h5288] deferred[^h309] not to do[^h6213] the thing[^h1697], because he had delight[^h2654] in Jacob's[^h3290] daughter[^h1323]: and he was more honourable[^h3513] than all the house[^h1004] of his father[^h1].
###### 20
And Hamor[^h2544] and Shechem[^h7927] his son[^h1121] came[^h935] unto the gate[^h8179] of their city[^h5892], and communed[^h1696] with the men[^h582] of their city[^h5892], saying[^h559],
###### 21
These men[^h582] are peaceable[^h8003] with[^h854] us; therefore let them dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776], and trade[^h5503] therein; for the land[^h776], behold, it is large[^h7342] enough[^h3027] for them[^h6440]; let us take[^h3947] their daughters[^h1323] to us for wives[^h802], and let us give[^h5414] them our daughters[^h1323].
###### 22
Only herein[^h2063] will the men[^h582] consent[^h225] unto us for to dwell[^h3427] with us, to be one[^h259] people[^h5971], if every male[^h2145] among us be circumcised[^h4135], as they are circumcised[^h4135].
###### 23
Shall not their cattle[^h4735] and their substance[^h7075] and every beast[^h929] of theirs be ours? only let us consent[^h225] unto them, and they will dwell[^h3427] with us.
###### 24
And unto Hamor[^h2544] and unto Shechem[^h7927] his son[^h1121] hearkened[^h8085] all that went out[^h3318] of the gate[^h8179] of his city[^h5892]; and every male[^h2145] was circumcised[^h4135], all that went out[^h3318] of the gate[^h8179] of his city[^h5892].
###### 25
And it came to pass on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], when they were sore[^h3510], that two[^h8147] of the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290], Simeon[^h8095] and Levi[^h3878], Dinah's[^h1783] brethren[^h251], took[^h3947] each man[^h376] his sword[^h2719], and came[^h935] upon the city[^h5892] boldly[^h983], and slew[^h2026] all the males[^h2145].
###### 26
And they slew[^h2026] Hamor[^h2544] and Shechem[^h7927] his son[^h1121] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and took[^h3947] Dinah[^h1783] out[^h3947] of Shechem's[^h7927] house[^h1004], and went out[^h3318]. 
###### 27
The sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] came[^h935] upon the slain[^h2491], and spoiled[^h962] the city[^h5892], because they had defiled[^h2930] their sister[^h269].
###### 28
They took[^h3947] their sheep[^h6629], and their oxen[^h1241], and their asses[^h2543], and that which was in the city[^h5892], and that which was in the field[^h7704],
###### 29
And all their wealth[^h2428], and all their little ones[^h2945], and their wives[^h802] took they captive[^h7617], and spoiled[^h962] even all that was in the house[^h1004].
###### 30
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] to Simeon[^h8095] and Levi[^h3878], Ye have troubled[^h5916] me to make me to stink[^h887] among the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776], among the Canaanites[^h3669] and the Perizzites[^h6522]: and I being few[^h4962] in number[^h4557], they shall gather themselves together[^h622] against me, and slay me[^h5221]; and I shall be destroyed[^h8045], I and my house[^h1004].
###### 31
And they said[^h559], Should he deal[^h6213] with our sister[^h269] as with an harlot[^h2181]?

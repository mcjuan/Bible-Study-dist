###### 1
Now Sarai[^h8297] Abram's[^h87] wife[^h802] bare[^h3205] him no[^h3808] children[^h3205]: and she had an handmaid[^h8198], an Egyptian[^h4713], whose name[^h8034] was Hagar[^h1904].
###### 2
And Sarai[^h8297] said[^h559] unto Abram[^h87], Behold now, the LORD[^h3068] hath restrained me[^h6113] from bearing[^h3205]: I pray thee, go in[^h935] unto my maid[^h8198]; it may[^h194] be that I may obtain children[^h1129] by her. And Abram[^h87] hearkened[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of Sarai[^h8297]. 
###### 3
And Sarai[^h8297] Abram's[^h87] wife[^h802] took[^h3947] Hagar[^h1904] her maid[^h8198] the Egyptian[^h4713], after[^h7093] Abram[^h87] had dwelt[^h3427] ten[^h6235] years[^h8141] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and gave[^h5414] her to her husband[^h376] Abram[^h87] to be his wife[^h802].
###### 4
And he went in[^h935] unto Hagar[^h1904], and she conceived[^h2029]: and when she saw[^h7200] that she had conceived[^h2029], her mistress[^h1404] was despised[^h7043] in her eyes[^h5869].
###### 5
And Sarai[^h8297] said[^h559] unto Abram[^h87], My wrong[^h2555] be upon thee: I have given[^h5414] my maid[^h8198] into thy bosom[^h2436]; and when she saw[^h7200] that she had conceived[^h2029], I was despised[^h7043] in her eyes[^h5869]: the LORD[^h3068] judge[^h8199] between me and thee.
###### 6
But Abram[^h87] said[^h559] unto Sarai[^h8297], Behold, thy maid[^h8198] is in thy hand[^h3027]; do[^h6213] to her as it pleaseth thee[^h2896] [^h5869]. And when Sarai[^h8297] dealt hardly with[^h6031] her, she fled[^h1272] from her face[^h6440].  
###### 7
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] found her[^h4672] by a fountain[^h5869] of water[^h4325] in the wilderness[^h4057], by the fountain[^h5869] in the way[^h1870] to Shur[^h7793].
###### 8
And he said[^h559], Hagar[^h1904], Sarai's[^h8297] maid[^h8198], whence[^h335] camest thou[^h935]? and whither wilt thou go[^h3212]? And she said[^h559], I flee[^h1272] from the face[^h6440] of my mistress[^h1404] Sarai[^h8297].
###### 9
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto her, Return[^h7725] to thy mistress[^h1404], and submit[^h6031] thyself under her hands[^h3027].
###### 10
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto her, I will multiply[^h7235] thy seed[^h2233] exceedingly[^h7235], that it shall not be numbered[^h5608] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 11
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto her, Behold[^h2009], thou art with child[^h2030], and shalt bear[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and shalt call[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Ishmael[^h3458]; because the LORD[^h3068] hath heard[^h8085] thy affliction[^h6040]. 
###### 12
And he will be a wild[^h6501] man[^h120]; his hand[^h3027] will be against every man, and every man's hand[^h3027] against him; and he shall dwell[^h7931] in the presence[^h6440] of all his brethren[^h251].
###### 13
And she called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] that spake[^h1696] unto her, Thou God[^h410] seest me[^h7210]: for she said[^h559], Have I also here[^h1988] looked[^h7200] after him[^h310] that seeth me[^h7210]?
###### 14
Wherefore the well[^h875] was called[^h7121] Beerlahairoi[^h883] [^h2416]; behold, it is between Kadesh[^h6946] and Bered[^h1260]. 
###### 15
And Hagar[^h1904] bare[^h3205] Abram[^h87] a son[^h1121]: and Abram[^h87] called[^h7121] his son's[^h1121] name[^h8034], which Hagar[^h1904] bare[^h3205], Ishmael[^h3458].
###### 16
And Abram[^h87] was fourscore[^h8084] [^h8141] and six[^h8337] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], when Hagar[^h1904] bare[^h3205] Ishmael[^h3458] to Abram[^h87].

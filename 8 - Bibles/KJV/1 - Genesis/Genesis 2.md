###### 1
Thus the heavens[^h8064] and the earth[^h776] were finished[^h3615], and all the host of them[^h6635].
###### 2
And on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] God[^h430] ended[^h3615] his work[^h4399] which he had made[^h6213]; and he rested[^h7673] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] from all his work[^h4399] which he had made[^h6213].
###### 3
And God[^h430] blessed[^h1288] the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], and sanctified[^h6942] it: because[^h3588] that in it he had rested[^h7673] from all his work[^h4399] which God[^h430] created[^h1254] and made[^h6213]. 
###### 4
These[^h428] are the generations[^h8435] of the heavens[^h8064] and of the earth[^h776] when they were created[^h1254], in the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] made[^h6213] the earth[^h776] and the heavens[^h8064],
###### 5
And every plant[^h7880] of the field[^h7704] before[^h2962] it was in the earth[^h776], and every herb[^h6212] of the field[^h7704] before[^h2962] it grew[^h6779]: for[^h3588] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] had not[^h3808] caused it to rain[^h4305] upon the earth[^h776], and there was not[^h369] a man[^h120] to till[^h5647] the ground[^h127].
###### 6
But there went up[^h5927] a mist[^h108] from[^h4480] the earth[^h776], and watered[^h8248] the whole face[^h6440] of the ground[^h127]. 
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] formed[^h3335] man[^h120] of the dust[^h6083] of[^h4480] the ground[^h127], and breathed[^h5301] into his nostrils[^h639] the breath[^h5397] of life[^h2416]; and man[^h120] became a living[^h2416] soul[^h5315]. 
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] planted[^h5193] a garden[^h1588] eastward[^h6924] in Eden[^h5731]; and there[^h8033] he put[^h7760] the man[^h120] whom[^h834] he had formed[^h3335].
###### 9
And out[^h4480] of the ground[^h127] made[^h6779] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] to grow[^h6779] every tree[^h6086] that is pleasant[^h2530] to the sight[^h4758], and good[^h2896] for food[^h3978]; the tree[^h6086] of life[^h2416] also in the midst[^h8432] of the garden[^h1588], and the tree[^h6086] of knowledge[^h1847] of good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451].
###### 10
And a river[^h5104] went out[^h3318] of Eden[^h5731] to water[^h8248] the garden[^h1588]; and from thence it was parted[^h6504], and became into four[^h702] heads[^h7218].
###### 11
The name[^h8034] of the first[^h259] is Pison[^h6376]: that[^h1931] is it which compasseth[^h5437] the whole land[^h776] of Havilah[^h2341], where[^h834] there is gold[^h2091];
###### 12
And the gold[^h2091] of that[^h1931] land[^h776] is good[^h2896]: there is bdellium[^h916] and the onyx[^h7718] stone[^h68].
###### 13
And the name[^h8034] of the second[^h8145] river[^h5104] is Gihon[^h1521]: the same is it that compasseth[^h5437] the whole land[^h776] of Ethiopia[^h3568]. 
###### 14
And the name[^h8034] of the third[^h7992] river[^h5104] is Hiddekel[^h2313]: that is it which goeth toward[^h1980] the east[^h6926] of Assyria[^h804]. And the fourth[^h7243] river[^h5104] is Euphrates[^h6578]. 
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] took[^h3947] the man[^h120], and put him[^h3240] into the garden[^h1588] of Eden[^h5731] to dress[^h5647] it and to keep[^h8104] it. 
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] the man[^h120], saying[^h559], Of every tree[^h6086] of the garden[^h1588] thou mayest freely[^h398] eat[^h398]: 
###### 17
But of the tree[^h6086] of the knowledge[^h1847] of good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451], thou shalt not eat[^h398] of it: for in the day[^h3117] that thou eatest[^h398] thereof thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]. 
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] said[^h559], It is not good[^h2896] that the man[^h120] should be[^h1961] alone; I will make[^h6213] him an help meet[^h5828] for him. 
###### 19
And out of the ground[^h127] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] formed[^h3335] every beast[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], and every fowl[^h5775] of the air[^h8064]; and brought[^h935] them unto Adam[^h120] to see[^h7200] what he would call[^h7121] them: and whatsoever Adam[^h120] called[^h7121] every living[^h2416] creature[^h5315], that[^h1931] was the name thereof[^h8034]. 
###### 20
And Adam[^h120] gave[^h7121] names[^h8034] to all cattle[^h929], and to the fowl[^h5775] of the air[^h8064], and to every beast[^h2416] of the field[^h7704]; but for Adam[^h120] there was not found[^h4672] an help meet[^h5828] for him. 
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] caused[^h5307] a deep sleep[^h8639] to fall[^h5307] upon Adam[^h121], and he slept[^h3462]: and he took[^h3947] one[^h259] of his ribs[^h6763], and closed up[^h5462] the flesh[^h1320] instead thereof;
###### 22
And the rib[^h6763], which the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] had taken[^h3947] from man[^h120], made[^h1129] he a woman[^h802], and brought[^h935] her unto the man[^h120]. 
###### 23
And Adam[^h120] said[^h559], This[^h2063] is now[^h6471] bone[^h6106] of my bones[^h6106], and flesh[^h1320] of my flesh[^h1320]: she[^h2063] shall be called[^h7121] Woman[^h802], because she[^h2063] was taken[^h3947] out of Man[^h376].  
###### 24
Therefore[^h3651] shall a man[^h376] leave[^h5800] his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517], and shall cleave[^h1692] unto his wife[^h802]: and they shall be one[^h259] flesh[^h1320].
###### 25
And they were both[^h8147] naked[^h6174], the man[^h120] and his wife[^h802], and were not ashamed[^h954].

###### 1
Then Joseph[^h3130] came[^h935] and told[^h5046] Pharaoh[^h6547], and said[^h559], My father[^h1] and my brethren[^h251], and their flocks[^h6629], and their herds[^h1241], and all that they have, are come out[^h935] of the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]; and, behold, they are in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657].
###### 2
And he took[^h3947] some[^h7097] of his brethren[^h251], even five[^h2568] men[^h582], and presented[^h3322] them unto[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 3
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], What is your occupation[^h4639]? And they said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], Thy servants[^h5650] are shepherds[^h7462] [^h6629], both we, and also our fathers[^h1].
###### 4
They said[^h559] moreover unto Pharaoh[^h6547], For to sojourn[^h1481] in the land[^h776] are we come[^h935]; for thy servants[^h5650] have no pasture[^h4829] for their flocks[^h6629]; for the famine[^h7458] is sore[^h3515] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants[^h5650] dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657].
###### 5
And Pharaoh[^h6547] spake[^h559] unto Joseph[^h3130], saying[^h559], Thy father[^h1] and thy brethren[^h251] are come[^h935] unto thee:
###### 6
The land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] is before thee[^h6440]; in the best[^h4315] of the land[^h776] make[^h3427] thy father[^h1] and brethren[^h251] to dwell[^h3427]; in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657] let them dwell[^h3427]: and if thou knowest[^h3045] [^h3426] any men[^h582] of activity[^h2428] among them, then make them[^h7760] rulers[^h8269] over my cattle[^h4735].
###### 7
And Joseph[^h3130] brought in[^h935] Jacob[^h3290] his father[^h1], and set him[^h5975] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547]: and Jacob[^h3290] blessed[^h1288] Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 8
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], How[^h4100] old[^h2416] [^h3117] [^h8141] art thou? 
###### 9
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], The days[^h3117] of the years[^h8141] of my pilgrimage[^h4033] are an hundred[^h3967] and thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141]: few[^h4592] and evil[^h7451] have the days[^h3117] of the years[^h8141] of my life[^h2416] been, and have not attained[^h5381] unto the days[^h3117] of the years[^h8141] of the life[^h2416] of my fathers[^h1] in the days[^h3117] of their pilgrimage[^h4033].
###### 10
And Jacob[^h3290] blessed[^h1288] Pharaoh[^h6547], and went out[^h3318] from before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 11
And Joseph[^h3130] placed[^h3427] his father[^h1] and his brethren[^h251], and gave[^h5414] them a possession[^h272] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in the best[^h4315] of the land[^h776], in the land[^h776] of Rameses[^h7486], as Pharaoh[^h6547] had commanded[^h6680].
###### 12
And Joseph[^h3130] nourished[^h3557] his father[^h1], and his brethren[^h251], and all his father's[^h1] household[^h1004], with bread[^h3899], according[^h6310] to their families[^h2945]. 
###### 13
And there was no bread[^h3899] in all the land[^h776]; for the famine[^h7458] was very[^h3966] sore[^h3515], so that the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] and all the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] fainted[^h3856] by reason[^h6440] of the famine[^h7458].
###### 14
And Joseph[^h3130] gathered up[^h3950] all the money[^h3701] that was found[^h4672] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], for the corn[^h7668] which they bought[^h7666]: and Joseph[^h3130] brought[^h935] the money[^h3701] into Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004].
###### 15
And when money[^h3701] failed[^h8552] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], all the Egyptians[^h4714] came[^h935] unto Joseph[^h3130], and said[^h559], Give[^h3051] us bread[^h3899]: for why should we die[^h4191] in thy presence? for the money[^h3701] faileth[^h656].
###### 16
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559], Give[^h3051] your cattle[^h4735]; and I will give[^h5414] you for your cattle[^h4735], if money[^h3701] fail[^h656].
###### 17
And they brought[^h935] their cattle[^h4735] unto Joseph[^h3130]: and Joseph[^h3130] gave[^h5414] them bread[^h3899] in exchange for horses[^h5483], and for the flocks[^h6629], and for the cattle[^h4735] of the herds[^h1241], and for the asses[^h2543]: and he fed[^h5095] them with bread[^h3899] for all their cattle[^h4735] for that year[^h8141]. 
###### 18
When that year[^h8141] was ended[^h8552], they came[^h935] unto him the second[^h8145] year[^h8141], and said[^h559] unto him, We will not hide[^h3582] it from my lord[^h113], how that our money[^h3701] is spent[^h8552]; my lord[^h113] also hath[^h413] our herds[^h4735] of cattle[^h929]; there is not ought left[^h7604] in the sight[^h6440] of my lord[^h113], but our bodies[^h1472], and our lands[^h127]:
###### 19
Wherefore shall we die[^h4191] before thine eyes[^h5869], both we and our land[^h127]? buy[^h7069] us and our land[^h127] for bread[^h3899], and we and our land[^h127] will be servants[^h5650] unto Pharaoh[^h6547]: and give[^h5414] us seed[^h2233], that we may live[^h2421], and not die[^h4191], that the land[^h127] be not desolate[^h3456].
###### 20
And Joseph[^h3130] bought[^h7069] all the land[^h127] of Egypt[^h4714] for Pharaoh[^h6547]; for the Egyptians[^h4714] sold[^h4376] every man[^h376] his field[^h7704], because the famine[^h7458] prevailed[^h2388] over them: so the land[^h776] became Pharaoh's[^h6547].
###### 21
And as for the people[^h5971], he removed[^h5674] them to cities[^h5892] from one end[^h7097] of the borders[^h1366] of Egypt[^h4714] even to the other end[^h7097] thereof.
###### 22
Only the land[^h127] of the priests[^h3548] bought he[^h7069] not; for the priests[^h3548] had a portion[^h2706] assigned them of Pharaoh[^h6547], and did eat[^h398] their portion[^h2706] which Pharaoh[^h6547] gave[^h5414] them: wherefore they sold[^h4376] not their lands[^h127]. 
###### 23
Then Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Behold, I have bought[^h7069] [^h853] you this day[^h3117] and your land[^h127] for Pharaoh[^h6547]: lo[^h1887], here is seed[^h2233] for you, and ye shall sow[^h2232] the land[^h127].
###### 24
And it shall come to pass in the increase[^h8393], that ye shall give[^h5414] the fifth[^h2549] part unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and four[^h702] parts[^h3027] shall be your own, for seed[^h2233] of the field[^h7704], and for your food[^h400], and for them of your households[^h1004], and for food[^h398] for your little ones[^h2945].
###### 25
And they said[^h559], Thou hast saved our lives[^h2421]: let us find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of my lord[^h113], and we will be Pharaoh's[^h6547] servants[^h5650].
###### 26
And Joseph[^h3130] made[^h7760] it a law[^h2706] over the land[^h127] of Egypt[^h4714] unto this day[^h3117], that Pharaoh[^h6547] should have the fifth[^h2569] part; except[^h7535] the land[^h127] of the priests[^h3548] only, which became not Pharaoh's[^h6547]. 
###### 27
And Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in the country[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657]; and they had possessions[^h270] therein, and grew[^h6509], and multiplied[^h7235] exceedingly[^h3966].
###### 28
And Jacob[^h3290] lived[^h2421] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] seventeen[^h6240] [^h7651] years[^h8141]: so the whole age[^h2416] [^h3117] of Jacob[^h3290] was an hundred[^h3967] forty[^h705] [^h8141] and seven[^h7651] years[^h8141]. 
###### 29
And the time[^h3117] drew nigh[^h7126] that Israel[^h3478] must die[^h4191]: and he called[^h7121] his son[^h1121] Joseph[^h3130], and said[^h559] unto him, If now I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], put[^h7760], I pray thee, thy hand[^h3027] under my thigh[^h3409], and deal[^h6213] kindly[^h2617] and truly[^h571] with me; bury[^h6912] me not, I pray thee, in Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 30
But I will lie[^h7901] with my fathers[^h1], and thou shalt carry[^h5375] me out of Egypt[^h4714], and bury[^h6912] me in their buryingplace[^h6900]. And he said[^h559], I will do[^h6213] as thou hast said[^h1697].
###### 31
And he said[^h559], Swear[^h7650] unto me. And he sware[^h7650] unto him. And Israel[^h3478] bowed[^h7812] himself upon the bed's[^h4296] head[^h7218].

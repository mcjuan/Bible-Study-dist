###### 1
And he commanded[^h6680] the steward of his house[^h1004], saying[^h559], Fill[^h4390] the men's[^h582] sacks[^h572] with food[^h400], as much as[^h834] they can[^h3201] carry[^h5375], and put[^h7760] every man's[^h376] money[^h3701] in his sack's[^h572] mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 2
And put[^h7760] my cup[^h1375], the silver[^h3701] cup[^h1375], in the sack's[^h572] mouth[^h6310] of the youngest[^h6996], and his corn[^h7668] money[^h3701]. And he did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] that Joseph[^h3130] had spoken[^h1696].
###### 3
As soon as the morning[^h1242] was light[^h215], the men[^h582] were sent away[^h7971], they and their asses[^h2543].
###### 4
And when they were gone out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892], and not yet far off[^h7368], Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto his steward[^h1004], Up[^h6965], follow[^h7291] after[^h310] the men[^h582]; and when thou dost overtake[^h5381] them, say[^h559] unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded[^h7999] evil[^h7451] for good[^h2896]?
###### 5
Is not this it in which my lord[^h113] drinketh[^h8354], and whereby indeed[^h5172] he divineth[^h5172]? ye have done evil[^h7489] in so doing[^h6213]. 
###### 6
And he overtook[^h5381] them, and he spake[^h1696] unto them these same[^h428] words[^h1697].
###### 7
And they said[^h559] unto him, Wherefore saith[^h1696] my lord[^h113] these words[^h1697]? God forbid[^h2486] that thy servants[^h5650] should do[^h6213] according to this thing[^h1697]:
###### 8
Behold, the money[^h3701], which we found[^h4672] in our sacks'[^h572] mouths[^h6310], we brought again[^h7725] unto thee out of the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]: how then should we steal[^h1589] out of thy lord's[^h113] house[^h1004] silver[^h3701] or gold[^h2091]?
###### 9
With whomsoever of thy servants[^h5650] it be found[^h4672], both let him die[^h4191], and we also will be my lord's[^h113] bondmen[^h5650].
###### 10
And he said[^h559], Now also let it be according unto your words[^h1697]:[^h3651] he with whom it is found[^h4672] shall be my servant[^h5650]; and ye shall be blameless[^h5355].
###### 11
Then they speedily[^h4116] took down[^h3381] every man[^h376] his sack[^h572] to the ground[^h776], and opened[^h6605] every man[^h376] his sack[^h572].
###### 12
And he searched[^h2664], and began[^h2490] at the eldest[^h1419], and left[^h3615] at the youngest[^h6996]: and the cup[^h1375] was found[^h4672] in Benjamin's[^h1144] sack[^h572].
###### 13
Then they rent[^h7167] their clothes[^h8071], and laded[^h6006] every man[^h376] his ass[^h2543], and returned[^h7725] to the city[^h5892].
###### 14
And Judah[^h3063] and his brethren[^h251] came[^h935] to Joseph's[^h3130] house[^h1004]; for he was yet there: and they fell[^h5307] before him[^h6440] on the ground[^h776].
###### 15
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto them, What deed[^h4639] is this that ye have done[^h6213]? wot ye[^h3045] not that such a man[^h376] as I can certainly[^h5172] divine[^h5172]? 
###### 16
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559], What shall we say[^h559] unto my lord[^h113]? what shall we speak[^h1696]? or how shall we clear ourselves[^h6663]? God[^h430] hath found out[^h4672] the iniquity[^h5771] of thy servants[^h5650]: behold, we are my lord's[^h113] servants[^h5650], both we, and he also[^h1571] with whom[^h834] [^h3027] the cup[^h1375] is found[^h4672].
###### 17
And he said[^h559], God forbid[^h2486] that I should do[^h6213] so[^h2063]: but the man[^h376] in whose hand[^h3027] the cup[^h1375] is found[^h4672], he shall be my servant[^h5650]; and as for you, get you up[^h5927] in peace[^h7965] unto your father[^h1].
###### 18
Then Judah[^h3063] came near[^h5066] unto him, and said[^h559], Oh[^h994] my lord[^h113], let thy servant[^h5650], I pray thee, speak[^h1696] a word[^h1697] in my lord's[^h113] ears[^h241], and let not thine anger[^h639] burn[^h2734] against thy servant[^h5650]: for thou art even as Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 19
My lord[^h113] asked[^h7592] his servants[^h5650], saying[^h559], Have[^h3426] ye a father[^h1], or a brother[^h251]?
###### 20
And we said[^h559] unto my lord[^h113], We have[^h3426] a father[^h1], an old man[^h2205], and a child[^h3206] of his old age[^h2208], a little one[^h6996]; and his brother[^h251] is dead[^h4191], and he alone is left[^h3498] of his mother[^h517], and his father[^h1] loveth[^h157] him.
###### 21
And thou saidst[^h559] unto thy servants[^h5650], Bring him down[^h3381] unto me, that I may set[^h7760] mine eyes[^h5869] upon him.
###### 22
And we said[^h559] unto my lord[^h113], The lad[^h5288] cannot[^h3201] leave[^h5800] his father[^h1]: for if he should leave[^h5800] his father[^h1], his father would die[^h4191].
###### 23
And thou saidst[^h559] unto thy servants[^h5650], Except[^h3808] your youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] come down[^h3381] with you, ye shall see[^h7200] [^h3254] my face[^h6440] no more[^h7200] [^h3254].
###### 24
And it came to pass when we came up[^h5927] unto thy servant[^h5650] my father[^h1], we told[^h5046] him the words[^h1697] of my lord[^h113].
###### 25
And our father[^h1] said[^h559], Go again[^h7725], and buy[^h7666] us a little[^h4592] food[^h400].
###### 26
And we said[^h559], We cannot[^h3201] go down[^h3381]: if our youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] be[^h3426] with us, then will we go down[^h3381]: for we may[^h3201] not see[^h7200] the man's[^h376] face[^h6440], except[^h369] our youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] be with us.
###### 27
And thy servant[^h5650] my father[^h1] said[^h559] unto us, Ye know[^h3045] that my wife[^h802] bare[^h3205] me two[^h8147] sons:
###### 28
And the one[^h259] went out[^h3318] from me, and I said[^h559], Surely[^h2963] he is torn in pieces[^h2963]; and I saw him[^h7200] not since[^h2008]:
###### 29
And if ye take[^h3947] this also from[^h5973] me[^h6440], and mischief[^h611] befall him[^h7136], ye shall bring down[^h3381] my gray hairs[^h7872] with sorrow[^h7451] to the grave[^h7585].
###### 30
Now therefore when I come[^h935] to thy servant[^h5650] my father[^h1], and the lad[^h5288] be not with us; seeing that his life[^h5315] is bound up[^h7194] in the lad's life[^h5315];
###### 31
It shall come to pass, when he seeth[^h7200] that the lad[^h5288] is not with us, that he will die[^h4191]: and thy servants[^h5650] shall bring down[^h3381] the gray hairs[^h7872] of thy servant[^h5650] our father[^h1] with sorrow[^h3015] to the grave[^h7585].
###### 32
For thy servant[^h5650] became surety[^h6148] for the lad[^h5288] unto[^h5973] my father[^h1], saying[^h559], If I bring[^h935] him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame[^h2398] to my father[^h1] for ever[^h3117].
###### 33
Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant[^h5650] abide[^h3427] instead of the lad[^h5288] a bondman[^h5650] to my lord[^h113]; and let the lad[^h5288] go up[^h5927] with his brethren[^h251].
###### 34
For how[^h349] shall I go up[^h5927] to my father[^h1], and the lad[^h5288] be not with me? lest peradventure I see[^h7200] the evil[^h7451] that shall come on[^h4672] my father[^h1].

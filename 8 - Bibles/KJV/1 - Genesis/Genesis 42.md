###### 1
Now when Jacob[^h3290] saw[^h7200] that there was[^h3426] corn[^h7668] in Egypt[^h4714], Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto his sons[^h1121], Why do ye look[^h7200] one upon another?
###### 2
And he said[^h559], Behold, I have heard[^h8085] that there is[^h3426] corn[^h7668] in Egypt[^h4714]: get you down[^h3381] thither, and buy[^h7666] for us from thence; that we may live[^h2421], and not die[^h4191].
###### 3
And Joseph's[^h3130] ten[^h6235] brethren[^h251] went down[^h3381] to buy[^h7666] corn[^h1250] in Egypt[^h4714].
###### 4
But Benjamin[^h1144], Joseph's[^h3130] brother[^h251], Jacob[^h3290] sent[^h7971] not with his brethren[^h251]; for he said[^h559], Lest peradventure[^h6435] mischief[^h611] befall him[^h7122].
###### 5
And the sons[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] to buy[^h7666] corn among[^h8432] those that came[^h935]: for the famine[^h7458] was in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667].
###### 6
And Joseph[^h3130] was the governor[^h7989] over the land[^h776], and he it was that sold[^h7666] to all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776]: and Joseph's[^h3130] brethren[^h251] came[^h935], and bowed down[^h7812] themselves before him with their faces[^h639] to the earth[^h776].
###### 7
And Joseph[^h3130] saw[^h7200] his brethren[^h251], and he knew[^h5234] them, but made himself strange[^h5234] unto them, and spake[^h1696] roughly[^h7186] unto them; and he said[^h559] unto them, Whence[^h370] come[^h935] ye? And they said[^h559], From the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] to buy[^h7666] food[^h400]. 
###### 8
And Joseph[^h3130] knew[^h5234] his brethren[^h251], but they knew[^h5234] not him.
###### 9
And Joseph[^h3130] remembered[^h2142] the dreams[^h2472] which he dreamed[^h2492] of them, and said[^h559] unto them, Ye are spies[^h7270]; to see[^h7200] the nakedness[^h6172] of the land[^h776] ye are come[^h935].
###### 10
And they said[^h559] unto him, Nay, my lord[^h113], but to buy[^h7666] food[^h400] are thy servants[^h5650] come[^h935].
###### 11
We[^h5168] are all one[^h259] man's[^h376] sons[^h1121]; we are true[^h3651] men, thy servants[^h5650] are no spies[^h7270].
###### 12
And he said[^h559] unto them, Nay, but to see[^h7200] the nakedness[^h6172] of the land[^h776] ye are come[^h935].
###### 13
And they said[^h559], Thy servants[^h5650] are twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] brethren[^h251], the sons[^h1121] of one[^h259] man[^h376] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]; and, behold, the youngest[^h6996] is this day[^h3117] with our father[^h1], and one[^h259] is not.
###### 14
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto them, That is it that I spake[^h1696] unto you, saying[^h559], Ye are spies[^h7270]:
###### 15
Hereby[^h2063] ye shall be proved[^h974]: By the life[^h2416] of Pharaoh[^h6547] ye shall not go forth[^h3318] hence, except your youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] come[^h935] hither.
###### 16
Send[^h7971] one[^h259] of you, and let him fetch[^h3947] your brother[^h251], and ye shall be kept in prison[^h631], that your words[^h1697] may be proved[^h974], whether there be any truth[^h571] in[^h854] you: or else[^h3808] by the life[^h2416] of Pharaoh[^h6547] surely ye are spies[^h7270]. 
###### 17
And he put them all together[^h622] into ward[^h4929] three[^h7969] days[^h3117]. 
###### 18
And Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559] unto them the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], This do[^h6213], and live[^h2421]; for I fear[^h3373] God[^h430]:
###### 19
If ye be true[^h3651] men, let one[^h259] of your brethren[^h251] be bound[^h631] in the house[^h1004] of your prison[^h4929]: go[^h3212] ye, carry[^h935] corn[^h7668] for the famine[^h7459] of your houses[^h1004]:
###### 20
But bring[^h935] your youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] unto me; so shall your words[^h1697] be verified[^h539], and ye shall not die[^h4191]. And they did[^h6213] so.
###### 21
And they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], We are verily[^h61] guilty[^h818] concerning our brother[^h251], in that[^h834] we saw[^h7200] the anguish[^h6869] of his soul[^h5315], when he besought[^h2603] us, and we would not hear[^h8085]; therefore is this distress[^h6869] come[^h935] upon us.
###### 22
And Reuben[^h7205] answered[^h6030] them, saying[^h559], Spake I[^h559] not unto you, saying[^h559], Do not sin[^h2398] against the child[^h3206]; and ye would not hear[^h8085]? therefore, behold, also his blood[^h1818] is required[^h1875].
###### 23
And they knew[^h3045] not that Joseph[^h3130] understood[^h8085] them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter[^h3887]. 
###### 24
And he turned himself about[^h5437] from them, and wept[^h1058]; and returned to them again[^h7725], and communed[^h1696] with them, and took[^h3947] from them Simeon[^h8095], and bound[^h631] him before their eyes[^h5869].
###### 25
Then Joseph[^h3130] commanded[^h6680] to fill[^h4390] their sacks[^h3627] with corn[^h1250], and to restore[^h7725] every man's[^h376] money[^h3701] into his sack[^h8242], and to give[^h5414] them provision[^h6720] for the way[^h1870]: and thus[^h3651] did he[^h6213] unto them.
###### 26
And they laded[^h5375] their asses[^h2543] with the corn[^h7668], and departed[^h3212] thence.
###### 27
And as one[^h259] of them opened[^h6605] his sack[^h8242] to give[^h5414] his ass[^h2543] provender[^h4554] in the inn[^h4411], he espied[^h7200] his money[^h3701]; for, behold, it was in his sack's[^h572] mouth[^h6310].
###### 28
And he said[^h559] unto his brethren[^h251], My money[^h3701] is restored[^h7725]; and, lo[^h2009], it is even in my sack[^h572]: and their heart[^h3820] failed[^h3318] them, and they were afraid[^h2729], saying[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], What is this that God[^h430] hath done[^h6213] unto us? 
###### 29
And they came[^h935] unto Jacob[^h3290] their father[^h1] unto the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and told[^h5046] him all that befell[^h7136] unto them; saying[^h559],
###### 30
The man[^h376], who is the lord[^h113] of the land[^h776], spake[^h1696] roughly[^h7186] to us, and took[^h5414] us for spies[^h7270] of the country[^h776]. 
###### 31
And we said[^h559] unto him, We are true[^h3651] men; we are no spies[^h7270]:
###### 32
We be twelve[^h6240] [^h8147] brethren[^h251], sons[^h1121] of our father[^h1]; one[^h259] is not, and the youngest[^h6996] is this day[^h3117] with our father[^h1] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667].
###### 33
And the man[^h376], the lord[^h113] of the country[^h776], said[^h559] unto us, Hereby shall I know[^h3045] that ye are true[^h3651] men; leave[^h3240] one[^h259] of your brethren[^h251] here with me, and take[^h3947] food for the famine[^h7459] of your households[^h1004], and be gone[^h3212]:
###### 34
And bring[^h935] your youngest[^h6996] brother[^h251] unto me: then shall I know[^h3045] that ye are no spies[^h7270], but that ye are true[^h3651] men: so will I deliver[^h5414] you your brother[^h251], and ye shall traffick[^h5503] in the land[^h776].
###### 35
And it came to pass as they emptied[^h7324] their sacks[^h8242], that, behold, every man's[^h376] bundle[^h6872] of money[^h3701] was in his sack[^h8242]: and when both they and their father[^h1] saw[^h7200] the bundles[^h6872] of money[^h3701], they were afraid[^h3372].
###### 36
And Jacob[^h3290] their father[^h1] said[^h559] unto them, Me have ye bereaved[^h7921] of my children: Joseph[^h3130] is not, and Simeon[^h8095] is not, and ye will take[^h3947] Benjamin[^h1144] away: all these things are against me.
###### 37
And Reuben[^h7205] spake[^h559] unto his father[^h1], saying[^h559], Slay[^h4191] my two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], if I bring[^h935] him not to thee: deliver[^h5414] him into my hand[^h3027], and I will bring him to thee again[^h7725].
###### 38
And he said[^h559], My son[^h1121] shall not go down[^h3381] with you; for his brother[^h251] is dead[^h4191], and he is left[^h7604] alone: if mischief[^h611] befall[^h7122] him by the way[^h1870] in the which ye go[^h3212], then shall ye bring down[^h3381] my gray hairs[^h7872] with sorrow[^h3015] to the grave[^h7585].

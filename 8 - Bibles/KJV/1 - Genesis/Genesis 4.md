###### 1
And Adam[^h120] knew[^h3045] [^h853] Eve[^h2332] his wife[^h802]; and she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] [^h853] Cain[^h7014], and said[^h559], I have gotten[^h7069] a man[^h376] from[^h854] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 2
And she again[^h3254] bare[^h3205] his brother[^h251] Abel[^h1893]. And Abel[^h1893] was a keeper[^h7462] of sheep[^h6629], but Cain[^h7014] was a tiller[^h5647] of the ground[^h127].  
###### 3
And in process[^h7093] of time[^h3117] it came to pass, that Cain[^h7014] brought[^h935] of the fruit[^h6529] of the ground[^h127] an offering[^h4503] unto the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 4
And Abel[^h1893], he[^h1931] also brought[^h935] of the firstlings[^h1062] of his flock[^h6629] and of the fat[^h2459] thereof. And the LORD[^h3068] had respect[^h8159] unto Abel[^h1893] and to his offering[^h4503]: 
###### 5
But unto Cain[^h7014] and to his offering[^h4503] he had not respect[^h8159]. And Cain[^h7014] was very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734], and his countenance[^h6440] fell[^h5307].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Cain[^h7014], Why art thou wroth[^h2734]? and why is thy countenance[^h6440] fallen[^h5307]?
###### 7
If[^h518] thou doest well[^h3190], shalt thou not be accepted[^h7613]? and if thou doest not well[^h3190], sin[^h2403] lieth[^h7257] at the door[^h6607]. And unto thee shall be his desire[^h8669], and thou shalt rule[^h4910] over him.  
###### 8
And Cain[^h7014] talked[^h559] with[^h413] Abel[^h1893] his brother[^h251]: and it came to pass, when they were in the field[^h7704], that Cain[^h7014] rose up[^h6965] against[^h413] Abel[^h1893] his brother[^h251], and slew him[^h2026].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Cain[^h7014], Where[^h335] is Abel[^h1893] thy brother[^h251]? And he said[^h559], I know[^h3045] not: Am I my brother's[^h251] keeper[^h8104]?
###### 10
And he said[^h559], What[^h4100] hast thou done[^h6213]? the voice[^h6963] of thy brother's[^h251] blood[^h1818] crieth[^h6817] unto me from the ground[^h127]. 
###### 11
And now art thou cursed[^h779] from the earth[^h127], which hath opened[^h6475] her mouth[^h6310] to receive[^h3947] thy brother's[^h251] blood[^h1818] from thy hand[^h3027];
###### 12
When[^h3588] thou tillest[^h5647] the ground[^h127], it shall not henceforth[^h3254] yield[^h5414] unto thee her strength[^h3581]; a fugitive[^h5128] and a vagabond[^h5110] shalt thou be in the earth[^h776].
###### 13
And Cain[^h7014] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], My punishment[^h5771] is greater[^h1419] than I can bear[^h5375]. 
###### 14
Behold, thou hast driven me out[^h1644] this day[^h3117] from the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127]; and from[^h5921] thy face[^h6440] shall I be hid[^h5641]; and I shall be a fugitive[^h5128] and a vagabond[^h5110] in the earth[^h776]; and it shall come to pass[^h1961], that every one that findeth me[^h4672] shall slay me[^h2026].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Therefore[^h3651] whosoever slayeth[^h2026] Cain[^h7014], vengeance shall be taken[^h5358] on him sevenfold[^h7659]. And the LORD[^h3068] set[^h7760] a mark[^h226] upon Cain[^h7014], lest[^h1115] any finding[^h4672] him should kill[^h5221] him.
###### 16
And Cain[^h7014] went out[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], and dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Nod[^h5113], on the east[^h6926] of Eden[^h5731].
###### 17
And Cain[^h7014] knew[^h3045] his wife[^h802]; and she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] Enoch[^h2585]: and he builded[^h1129] a city[^h5892], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892], after the name[^h8034] of his son[^h1121], Enoch[^h2585]. 
###### 18
And unto Enoch[^h2585] was born[^h3205] Irad[^h5897]: and Irad[^h5897] begat[^h3205] Mehujael[^h4232]: and Mehujael[^h4232] begat[^h3205] Methusael[^h4967]: and Methusael[^h4967] begat[^h3205] Lamech[^h3929]. 
###### 19
And Lamech[^h3929] took[^h3947] unto him two[^h8147] wives[^h802]: the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Adah[^h5711], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Zillah[^h6741].
###### 20
And Adah[^h5711] bare[^h3205] Jabal[^h2989]: he was the father[^h1] of such as dwell[^h3427] in tents[^h168], and of such as have cattle[^h4735].
###### 21
And his brother's[^h251] name[^h8034] was Jubal[^h3106]: he was the father[^h1] of all such as handle[^h8610] the harp[^h3658] and organ[^h5748].
###### 22
And Zillah[^h6741], she also bare[^h3205] Tubalcain[^h8423], an instructer[^h3913] of every artificer[^h2794] in brass[^h5178] and iron[^h1270]: and the sister[^h269] of Tubalcain[^h8423] was Naamah[^h5279]. 
###### 23
And Lamech[^h3929] said[^h559] unto his wives[^h802], Adah[^h5711] and Zillah[^h6741], Hear[^h8085] my voice[^h6963]; ye wives[^h802] of Lamech[^h3929], hearken[^h238] unto my speech[^h565]: for I have slain[^h2026] a man[^h376] to my wounding[^h6482], and a young man[^h3206] to my hurt[^h2250].  
###### 24
If[^h3588] Cain[^h7014] shall be avenged[^h5358] sevenfold[^h7659], truly Lamech[^h3929] seventy[^h7657] and sevenfold[^h7651].
###### 25
And Adam[^h120] knew[^h3045] his wife[^h802] again[^h5750]; and she bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Seth[^h8352]: For God[^h430], said she, hath appointed[^h7896] me another[^h312] seed[^h2233] instead[^h8478] of Abel[^h1893], whom[^h3588] Cain[^h7014] slew[^h2026]. 
###### 26
And to Seth[^h8352], to him[^h1931] also there was born[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Enos[^h583]: then began men[^h2490] to call[^h7121] upon the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].

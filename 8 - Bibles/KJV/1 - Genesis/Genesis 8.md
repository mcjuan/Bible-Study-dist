###### 1
And God[^h430] remembered[^h2142] Noah[^h5146], and every living thing[^h2416], and all the cattle[^h929] that was with him in the ark[^h8392]: and God[^h430] made[^h5674] a wind[^h7307] to pass[^h5674] over[^h5921] the earth[^h776], and the waters[^h4325] asswaged[^h7918];
###### 2
The fountains[^h4599] also of the deep[^h8415] and the windows[^h699] of heaven[^h8064] were stopped[^h5534], and the rain[^h1653] from heaven[^h8064] was restrained[^h3607];
###### 3
And the waters[^h4325] returned[^h7725] from off the earth[^h776] continually[^h1980] [^h7725]: and after the end[^h7097] of the hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] days[^h3117] the waters[^h4325] were abated[^h2637]. 
###### 4
And the ark[^h8392] rested[^h5117] in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320], on the seventeenth[^h6240] [^h7651] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320], upon the mountains[^h2022] of Ararat[^h780].
###### 5
And the waters[^h4325] decreased[^h2637] continually[^h1980] until[^h5704] the tenth[^h6224] month[^h2320]: in the tenth[^h6224] month, on the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], were the tops[^h7218] of the mountains[^h2022] seen[^h7200]. 
###### 6
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of forty[^h705] days[^h3117], that Noah[^h5146] opened[^h6605] the window[^h2474] of the ark[^h8392] which he had made[^h6213]:
###### 7
And he sent forth[^h7971] a raven[^h6158], which went forth[^h3318] to[^h3318] and fro[^h7725], until the waters[^h4325] were dried up[^h3001] from off the earth[^h776]. 
###### 8
Also he sent forth[^h7971] a dove[^h3123] from him, to see[^h7200] if the waters[^h4325] were abated[^h7043] from off the face[^h6440] of the ground[^h127];
###### 9
But the dove[^h3123] found[^h4672] no rest[^h4494] for the sole[^h3709] of her foot[^h7272], and she returned[^h7725] unto him into the ark[^h8392], for the waters[^h4325] were on the face[^h6440] of the whole earth[^h776]: then he put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and took her[^h3947], and pulled her in[^h935] unto him into the ark[^h8392]. 
###### 10
And he stayed[^h2342] yet other[^h312] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]; and again[^h3254] he sent forth[^h7971] the dove[^h3123] out of the ark[^h8392];
###### 11
And the dove[^h3123] came in[^h935] to him in the evening[^h6256] [^h6153]; and, lo, in her mouth[^h6310] was an olive[^h2132] leaf[^h5929] pluckt off[^h2965]: so Noah[^h5146] knew[^h3045] that the waters[^h4325] were abated[^h7043] from off the earth[^h776].
###### 12
And he stayed[^h3176] yet other[^h312] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]; and sent forth[^h7971] the dove[^h3123]; which returned[^h7725] not again[^h3254] unto him any more[^h5750].
###### 13
And it came to pass in the six[^h8337] hundredth[^h3967] and first year[^h8141], in the first[^h7223] month, the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], the waters[^h4325] were dried up[^h2717] from off the earth[^h776]: and Noah[^h5146] removed[^h5493] the covering[^h4372] of the ark[^h8392], and looked[^h7200], and, behold, the face[^h6440] of the ground[^h127] was dry[^h2717].
###### 14
And in the second[^h8145] month[^h2320], on the seven[^h7651] and twentieth[^h6242] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320], was the earth[^h776] dried[^h3001].
###### 15
And God[^h430] spake[^h1696] unto Noah[^h5146], saying[^h559],
###### 16
Go forth[^h3318] of the ark[^h8392], thou, and thy wife[^h802], and thy sons[^h1121], and thy sons'[^h1121] wives[^h802] with thee.
###### 17
Bring forth[^h3318] with thee every living thing[^h2416] that is with thee, of all flesh[^h1320], both of fowl[^h5775], and of cattle[^h929], and of every creeping thing[^h7431] that creepeth[^h7430] upon the earth[^h776]; that they may breed abundantly[^h8317] in the earth[^h776], and be fruitful[^h6509], and multiply[^h7235] upon the earth[^h776].
###### 18
And Noah[^h5146] went forth[^h3318], and his sons[^h1121], and his wife[^h802], and his sons'[^h1121] wives[^h802] with him:
###### 19
Every beast[^h2416], every creeping thing[^h7431], and every fowl[^h5775], and whatsoever[^h3605] creepeth[^h7430] upon the earth[^h776], after their kinds[^h4940], went forth[^h3318] out of the ark[^h8392]. 
###### 20
And Noah[^h5146] builded[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and took[^h3947] of every clean[^h2889] beast[^h929], and of every clean[^h2889] fowl[^h5775], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] on the altar[^h4196].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] smelled[^h7306] a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381]; and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] in[^h413] his heart[^h3820], I will not again[^h3254] curse[^h7043] the ground[^h127] any more for man's[^h120] sake[^h5668]; for the imagination[^h3336] of man's[^h120] heart[^h3820] is evil[^h7451] from his youth[^h5271]; neither will I again[^h3254] smite[^h5221] any more every thing living[^h2416], as I have done[^h6213].  
###### 22
While the earth[^h776] remaineth[^h3117], seedtime[^h2233] and harvest[^h7105], and cold[^h7120] and heat[^h2527], and summer[^h7019] and winter[^h2779], and day[^h3117] and night[^h3915] shall not cease[^h7673].

###### 1
And Abraham[^h85] journeyed[^h5265] from thence toward the south[^h5045] country[^h776], and dwelled[^h3427] between Kadesh[^h6946] and Shur[^h7793], and sojourned[^h1481] in Gerar[^h1642].
###### 2
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559] of[^h413] Sarah[^h8283] his wife[^h802], She is my sister[^h269]: and Abimelech[^h40] king[^h4428] of Gerar[^h1642] sent[^h7971], and took[^h3947] Sarah[^h8283].
###### 3
But God[^h430] came[^h935] to Abimelech[^h40] in a dream[^h2472] by night[^h3915], and said[^h559] to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man[^h4191], for the woman[^h802] which thou hast taken[^h3947]; for she is a man's[^h1167] wife[^h1166]. 
###### 4
But Abimelech[^h40] had not come near[^h7126] her: and he said[^h559], Lord[^h136], wilt thou slay[^h2026] also a righteous[^h6662] nation[^h1471]?
###### 5
Said[^h559] he not unto me, She[^h1931] is my sister[^h269]? and she[^h1931], even[^h1571] she[^h1931] herself said[^h559], He is my brother[^h251]: in the integrity[^h8537] of my heart[^h3824] and innocency[^h5356] of my hands[^h3709] have I done[^h6213] this. 
###### 6
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto him in a dream[^h2472], Yea[^h1571], I know[^h3045] that thou didst[^h6213] this in the integrity[^h8537] of thy heart[^h3824]; for I also withheld[^h2820] thee from sinning[^h2398] against me: therefore suffered[^h5414] I thee not to touch[^h5060] her.
###### 7
Now therefore restore[^h7725] the man[^h376] his wife[^h802]; for he is a prophet[^h5030], and he shall pray[^h6419] for thee[^h1157], and thou shalt live[^h2421]: and if thou restore[^h7725] her not, know[^h3045] thou that thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191], thou, and all that are thine.
###### 8
Therefore Abimelech[^h40] rose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and called[^h7121] all his servants[^h5650], and told[^h1696] all these things[^h1697] in their ears[^h241]: and the men[^h582] were sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372].
###### 9
Then Abimelech[^h40] called[^h7121] Abraham[^h85], and said[^h559] unto him, What hast thou done[^h6213] unto us? and what have I offended[^h2398] thee, that thou hast brought[^h935] on me and on my kingdom[^h4467] a great[^h1419] sin[^h2401]? thou hast done[^h6213] deeds[^h4639] unto me that ought not to be done[^h6213].
###### 10
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559] unto Abraham[^h85], What[^h4100] sawest thou[^h7200], that thou hast done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]?
###### 11
And Abraham[^h85] said[^h559], Because I thought[^h559], Surely[^h7535] the fear[^h3374] of God[^h430] is not in this place[^h4725]; and they will slay me[^h2026] for my wife's[^h802] sake[^h1697].
###### 12
And yet indeed[^h546] she is my sister[^h269]; she is the daughter[^h1323] of my father[^h1], but not the daughter[^h1323] of my mother[^h517]; and she became my wife[^h802].
###### 13
And it came to pass, when God[^h430] caused me to wander[^h8582] from my father's[^h1] house[^h1004], that I said[^h559] unto her, This is thy kindness[^h2617] which thou shalt shew[^h6213] unto me; at every place[^h4725] whither we shall come[^h935], say[^h559] of me, He is my brother[^h251].
###### 14
And Abimelech[^h40] took[^h3947] sheep[^h6629], and oxen[^h1241], and menservants[^h5650], and womenservants[^h8198], and gave[^h5414] them unto Abraham[^h85], and restored[^h7725] him Sarah[^h8283] his wife[^h802].
###### 15
And Abimelech[^h40] said[^h559], Behold, my land[^h776] is before thee[^h6440]: dwell[^h3427] where it pleaseth[^h2896] [^h5869] thee. 
###### 16
And unto Sarah[^h8283] he said[^h559], Behold, I have given[^h5414] thy brother[^h251] a thousand[^h505] pieces of silver[^h3701]: behold, he is to thee a covering[^h3682] of the eyes[^h5869], unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved[^h3198].
###### 17
So Abraham[^h85] prayed[^h6419] unto God[^h430]: and God[^h430] healed[^h7495] Abimelech[^h40], and his wife[^h802], and his maidservants[^h519]; and they bare[^h3205] children.
###### 18
For the LORD[^h3068] had fast[^h6113] closed up[^h6113] all the wombs[^h7358] of the house[^h1004] of Abimelech[^h40], because[^h1697] of Sarah[^h8283] Abraham's[^h85] wife[^h802].

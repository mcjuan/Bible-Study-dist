###### 1
And it came to pass[^h1961], that when Isaac[^h3327] was old[^h2204], and his eyes[^h5869] were dim[^h3543], so that he could not see[^h7200], he called[^h7121] Esau[^h6215] his eldest[^h1419] son[^h1121], and said[^h559] unto him, My son[^h1121]: and he said[^h559] unto him, Behold, here am I.
###### 2
And he said[^h559], Behold now, I am old[^h2204], I know[^h3045] not the day[^h3117] of my death[^h4194]:
###### 3
Now therefore take[^h5375], I pray thee, thy weapons[^h3627], thy quiver[^h8522] and thy bow[^h7198], and go out[^h3318] to the field[^h7704], and take[^h6679] me some venison[^h6718] [^h6720]; 
###### 4
And make[^h6213] me savoury meat[^h4303], such as[^h834] I love[^h157], and bring[^h935] it to me, that I may eat[^h398]; that my soul[^h5315] may bless[^h1288] thee before[^h2962] I die[^h4191].
###### 5
And Rebekah[^h7259] heard[^h8085] when Isaac[^h3327] spake[^h1696] to Esau[^h6215] his son[^h1121]. And Esau[^h6215] went[^h3212] to the field[^h7704] to hunt[^h6679] for venison[^h6718], and to bring[^h935] it.
###### 6
And Rebekah[^h7259] spake[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290] her son[^h1121], saying[^h559], Behold, I heard[^h8085] thy father[^h1] speak[^h1696] unto Esau[^h6215] thy brother[^h251], saying[^h559],
###### 7
Bring[^h935] me venison[^h6718], and make[^h6213] me savoury meat[^h4303], that I may eat[^h398], and bless[^h1288] thee before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] my death[^h4194].
###### 8
Now therefore, my son[^h1121], obey[^h8085] my voice[^h6963] according to that which[^h834] I command[^h6680] thee.
###### 9
Go[^h3212] now to the flock[^h6629], and fetch[^h3947] me from thence two[^h8147] good[^h2896] kids[^h1423] of the goats[^h5795]; and I will make[^h6213] them savoury meat[^h4303] for thy father[^h1], such as he loveth[^h157]:
###### 10
And thou shalt bring[^h935] it to thy father[^h1], that he may eat[^h398], and that[^h834] he may bless[^h1288] thee before[^h6440] his death[^h4194].
###### 11
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] to Rebekah[^h7259] his mother[^h517], Behold, Esau[^h6215] my brother[^h251] is a hairy[^h8163] man[^h376], and I am a smooth[^h2509] man[^h376]:
###### 12
My father[^h1] peradventure will feel[^h4959] me, and I shall seem[^h5869] to him as a deceiver[^h8591]; and I shall bring[^h935] a curse[^h7045] upon me, and not a blessing[^h1293].
###### 13
And his mother[^h517] said[^h559] unto him, Upon me be thy curse[^h7045], my son[^h1121]: only obey[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], and go[^h3212] fetch[^h3947] me them.
###### 14
And he went[^h3212], and fetched[^h3947], and brought[^h935] them to his mother[^h517]: and his mother[^h517] made[^h6213] savoury meat[^h4303], such as his father[^h1] loved[^h157].
###### 15
And Rebekah[^h7259] took[^h3947] goodly[^h2532] raiment[^h899] of her eldest[^h1419] son[^h1121] Esau[^h6215], which were with her in the house[^h1004], and put them upon[^h3847] Jacob[^h3290] her younger[^h6996] son[^h1121]: 
###### 16
And she put[^h3847] the skins[^h5785] of the kids[^h1423] of the goats[^h5795] upon his hands[^h3027], and upon the smooth[^h2513] of his neck[^h6677]:
###### 17
And she gave[^h5414] the savoury meat[^h4303] and the bread[^h3899], which she had prepared[^h6213], into the hand[^h3027] of her son[^h1121] Jacob[^h3290].
###### 18
And he came[^h935] unto his father[^h1], and said[^h559], My father[^h1]: and he said[^h559], Here am I; who art thou, my son[^h1121]?
###### 19
And Jacob[^h3290] said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], I am Esau[^h6215] thy firstborn[^h1060]; I have done[^h6213] according as thou badest[^h1696] me: arise[^h6965], I pray thee, sit[^h3427] and eat[^h398] of my venison[^h6718], that thy soul[^h5315] may bless[^h1288] me.
###### 20
And Isaac[^h3327] said[^h559] unto his son[^h1121], How is it that thou hast found[^h4672] it so quickly[^h4116], my son[^h1121]? And he said[^h559], Because the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] brought[^h7136] it to me[^h6440]. 
###### 21
And Isaac[^h3327] said[^h559] unto Jacob[^h3290], Come near[^h5066], I pray thee, that I may feel[^h4184] thee, my son[^h1121], whether thou be my very[^h2088] son[^h1121] Esau[^h6215] or not.
###### 22
And Jacob[^h3290] went near[^h5066] unto Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1]; and he felt[^h4959] him, and said[^h559], The voice[^h6963] is Jacob's[^h3290] voice[^h6963], but the hands[^h3027] are the hands[^h3027] of Esau[^h6215].
###### 23
And he discerned[^h5234] him not, because his hands[^h3027] were hairy[^h8163], as his brother[^h251] Esau's[^h6215] hands[^h3027]: so he blessed[^h1288] him.
###### 24
And he said[^h559], Art thou my very son[^h1121] Esau[^h6215]? And he said[^h559], I am.
###### 25
And he said[^h559], Bring it near[^h5066] to me, and I will eat[^h398] of my son's[^h1121] venison[^h6718], that my soul[^h5315] may bless[^h1288] thee. And he brought it near[^h5066] to him, and he did eat[^h398]: and he brought[^h935] him wine[^h3196], and he drank[^h8354].
###### 26
And his father[^h1] Isaac[^h3327] said[^h559] unto him, Come near[^h5066] now, and kiss[^h5401] me, my son[^h1121].
###### 27
And he came near[^h5066], and kissed[^h5401] him: and he smelled[^h7306] the smell[^h7381] of his raiment[^h899], and blessed[^h1288] him, and said[^h559], See[^h7200], the smell[^h7381] of my son[^h1121] is as the smell[^h7381] of a field[^h7704] which the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288]:
###### 28
Therefore God[^h430] give[^h5414] thee of the dew[^h2919] of heaven[^h8064], and the fatness[^h4924] of the earth[^h776], and plenty[^h7230] of corn[^h1715] and wine[^h8492]:
###### 29
Let people[^h5971] serve[^h5647] thee, and nations[^h3816] bow down[^h7812] to thee: be[^h1933] lord[^h1376] over thy brethren[^h251], and let thy mother's[^h517] sons[^h1121] bow down[^h7812] to thee: cursed[^h779] be every one that curseth[^h779] thee, and blessed[^h1288] be he that blesseth[^h1288] thee.
###### 30
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac[^h3327] had made an end[^h3615] of blessing[^h1288] Jacob[^h3290], and Jacob[^h3290] was yet[^h389] scarce[^h3318] gone out[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1], that Esau[^h6215] his brother[^h251] came in[^h935] from his hunting[^h6718].
###### 31
And he also had made[^h6213] savoury meat[^h4303], and brought it[^h935] unto his father[^h1], and said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], Let my father[^h1] arise[^h6965], and eat[^h398] of his son's[^h1121] venison[^h6718], that thy soul[^h5315] may bless[^h1288] me.
###### 32
And Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1] said[^h559] unto him, Who art thou? And he said[^h559], I am thy son[^h1121], thy firstborn[^h1060] Esau[^h6215].
###### 33
And Isaac[^h3327] trembled[^h2729] very[^h1419] exceedingly[^h3966] [^h2731], and said[^h559], Who? where[^h645] is he that hath taken[^h6679] venison[^h6718], and brought[^h935] it me, and I have eaten[^h398] of all before thou camest[^h935], and have blessed[^h1288] him? yea, and he shall be blessed[^h1288].  
###### 34
And when Esau[^h6215] heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of his father[^h1], he cried[^h6817] with a great[^h1419] and exceeding[^h3966] bitter[^h4751] cry[^h6818], and said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], Bless[^h1288] me, even me also, O my father[^h1].
###### 35
And he said[^h559], Thy brother[^h251] came[^h935] with subtilty[^h4820], and hath taken away[^h3947] thy blessing[^h1293].
###### 36
And he said[^h559], Is not he rightly[^h3588] named[^h7121] [^h8034] Jacob[^h3290]? for he hath supplanted me[^h6117] these[^h2088] two times[^h6471]: he took away[^h3947] my birthright[^h1062]; and, behold, now he hath taken away[^h3947] my blessing[^h1293]. And he said[^h559], Hast thou not reserved[^h680] a blessing[^h1293] for me? 
###### 37
And Isaac[^h3327] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto Esau[^h6215], Behold, I have made[^h7760] him thy lord[^h1376], and all his brethren[^h251] have I given[^h5414] to him for servants[^h5650]; and with corn[^h1715] and wine[^h8492] have I sustained[^h5564] him: and what shall I do[^h6213] now[^h645] unto thee, my son[^h1121]? 
###### 38
And Esau[^h6215] said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], Hast thou but one[^h259] blessing[^h1293], my father[^h1]? bless[^h1288] me, even me also, O my father[^h1]. And Esau[^h6215] lifted up[^h5375] his voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 39
And Isaac[^h3327] his father[^h1] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto him, Behold, thy dwelling[^h4186] shall be the fatness[^h4924] of the earth[^h776], and of the dew[^h2919] of heaven[^h8064] from above[^h5920]; 
###### 40
And by thy sword[^h2719] shalt thou live[^h2421], and shalt serve[^h5647] thy brother[^h251]; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion[^h7300], that thou shalt break[^h6561] his yoke[^h5923] from off thy neck[^h6677].
###### 41
And Esau[^h6215] hated[^h7852] Jacob[^h3290] because[^h5921] of the blessing[^h1293] wherewith[^h834] his father[^h1] blessed him[^h1288]: and Esau[^h6215] said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], The days[^h3117] of mourning[^h60] for my father[^h1] are at hand[^h7126]; then will I slay[^h2026] my brother[^h251] Jacob[^h3290].
###### 42
And these words[^h1697] of Esau[^h6215] her elder[^h1419] son[^h1121] were told[^h5046] to Rebekah[^h7259]: and she sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] Jacob[^h3290] her younger[^h6996] son[^h1121], and said[^h559] unto him, Behold, thy brother[^h251] Esau[^h6215], as touching thee, doth comfort[^h5162] himself, purposing to kill[^h2026] thee.
###### 43
Now therefore, my son[^h1121], obey[^h8085] my voice[^h6963]; and arise[^h6965], flee[^h1272] thou to Laban[^h3837] my brother[^h251] to Haran[^h2771];
###### 44
And tarry[^h3427] with him a few[^h259] days[^h3117], until[^h834] thy brother's[^h251] fury[^h2534] turn away[^h7725];
###### 45
Until thy brother's[^h251] anger[^h639] turn away[^h7725] from thee, and he forget[^h7911] that which thou hast done[^h6213] to him: then I will send[^h7971], and fetch[^h3947] thee from thence: why[^h4100] should I be deprived[^h7921] also of you both[^h8147] in one[^h259] day[^h3117]?
###### 46
And Rebekah[^h7259] said[^h559] to Isaac[^h3327], I am weary[^h6973] of my life[^h2416] because[^h6440] of the daughters[^h1323] of Heth[^h2845]: if Jacob[^h3290] take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] of the daughters[^h1323] of Heth[^h2845], such as these which are of the daughters[^h1323] of the land[^h776], what good[^h4100] shall my life[^h2416] do me?

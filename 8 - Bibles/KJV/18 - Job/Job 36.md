###### 1
Elihu[^h453] also proceeded[^h3254], and said[^h559],
###### 2
Suffer[^h3803] me a little[^h2191], and I will shew[^h2331] thee that I have yet to speak[^h4405] on God's[^h433] behalf. 
###### 3
I will fetch[^h5375] my knowledge[^h1843] from afar[^h7350], and will ascribe[^h5414] righteousness[^h6664] to my Maker[^h6466].
###### 4
For truly[^h551] my words[^h4405] shall not be false[^h8267]: he that is perfect[^h8549] in knowledge[^h1844] is with thee.
###### 5
Behold, God[^h410] is mighty[^h3524], and despiseth[^h3988] not any: he is mighty[^h3524] in strength[^h3581] and wisdom[^h3820]. 
###### 6
He preserveth not the life[^h2421] of the wicked[^h7563]: but giveth[^h5414] right[^h4941] to the poor[^h6041]. 
###### 7
He withdraweth[^h1639] not his eyes[^h5869] from the righteous[^h6662]: but with kings[^h4428] are they on the throne[^h3678]; yea, he doth establish[^h3427] them for ever[^h5331], and they are exalted[^h1361].
###### 8
And if they be bound[^h631] in fetters[^h2131], and be holden[^h3920] in cords[^h2256] of affliction[^h6040];
###### 9
Then he sheweth[^h5046] them their work[^h6467], and their transgressions[^h6588] that they have exceeded[^h1396].
###### 10
He openeth[^h1540] also their ear[^h241] to discipline[^h4148], and commandeth[^h559] that they return[^h7725] from iniquity[^h205].
###### 11
If they obey[^h8085] and serve[^h5647] him, they shall spend[^h3615] their days[^h3117] in prosperity[^h2896], and their years[^h8141] in pleasures[^h5273].
###### 12
But if they obey[^h8085] not, they shall perish[^h5674] by the sword[^h7973], and they shall die[^h1478] without knowledge[^h1847]. 
###### 13
But the hypocrites[^h2611] in heart[^h3820] heap up[^h7760] wrath[^h639]: they cry[^h7768] not when he bindeth[^h631] them.
###### 14
They[^h5315] die[^h4191] in youth[^h5290], and their life[^h2416] is among the unclean[^h6945].  
###### 15
He delivereth[^h2502] the poor[^h6041] in his affliction[^h6040], and openeth[^h1540] their ears[^h241] in oppression[^h3906]. 
###### 16
Even so would he have removed[^h5496] thee out of the strait[^h6310] [^h6862] into a broad place[^h7338], where[^h8478] there is no straitness[^h4164]; and that which should be set[^h5183] on thy table[^h7979] should be full[^h4390] of fatness[^h1880]. 
###### 17
But thou hast fulfilled[^h4390] the judgment[^h1779] of the wicked[^h7563]: judgment[^h1779] and justice[^h4941] take hold[^h8551] on thee. 
###### 18
Because there is wrath[^h2534], beware lest he take thee away[^h5496] with his stroke[^h5607]: then a great[^h7230] ransom[^h3724] cannot deliver[^h5186] thee. 
###### 19
Will he esteem[^h6186] thy riches[^h7769]? no, not gold[^h1222], nor all the forces[^h3981] of strength[^h3581].
###### 20
Desire[^h7602] not the night[^h3915], when people[^h5971] are cut off[^h5927] in their place.
###### 21
Take heed[^h8104], regard[^h6437] not iniquity[^h205]: for this hast thou chosen[^h977] rather than affliction[^h6040].
###### 22
Behold, God[^h410] exalteth[^h7682] by his power[^h3581]: who teacheth[^h3384] like him?
###### 23
Who hath enjoined[^h6485] him his way[^h1870]? or who can say[^h559], Thou hast wrought[^h6466] iniquity[^h5766]?
###### 24
Remember[^h2142] that thou magnify[^h7679] his work[^h6467], which men[^h582] behold[^h7891].
###### 25
Every man[^h120] may see[^h2372] it; man[^h582] may behold[^h5027] it afar off[^h7350].
###### 26
Behold, God[^h410] is great[^h7689], and we know[^h3045] him not, neither can the number[^h4557] of his years[^h8141] be searched out[^h2714].
###### 27
For he maketh small[^h1639] the drops[^h5198] of water[^h4325]: they pour down[^h2212] rain[^h4306] according to the vapour[^h108] thereof:
###### 28
Which the clouds[^h7834] do drop[^h5140] and distil[^h7491] upon man[^h120] abundantly[^h7227].
###### 29
Also can any understand[^h995] the spreadings[^h4666] of the clouds[^h5645], or the noise[^h8663] of his tabernacle[^h5521]?
###### 30
Behold, he spreadeth[^h6566] his light[^h216] upon it, and covereth[^h3680] the bottom[^h8328] of the sea[^h3220]. 
###### 31
For by them judgeth[^h1777] he the people[^h5971]; he giveth[^h5414] meat[^h400] in abundance[^h4342].
###### 32
With clouds[^h3709] he covereth[^h3680] the light[^h216]; and commandeth[^h6680] it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt[^h6293].
###### 33
The noise[^h7452] thereof sheweth[^h5046] concerning it, the cattle[^h4735] also concerning the vapour[^h5927].

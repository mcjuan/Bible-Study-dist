###### 1
Then answered[^h6030] Eliphaz[^h464] the Temanite[^h8489], and said[^h559],
###### 2
Should a wise man[^h2450] utter[^h6030] vain[^h7307] knowledge[^h1847], and fill[^h4390] his belly[^h990] with the east wind[^h6921]? 
###### 3
Should he reason[^h3198] with unprofitable[^h5532] talk[^h1697]? or with speeches[^h4405] wherewith he can do no good[^h3276]?
###### 4
Yea, thou castest off[^h6565] fear[^h3374], and restrainest[^h1639] prayer[^h7881] before[^h6440] God[^h410].  
###### 5
For thy mouth[^h6310] uttereth[^h502] thine iniquity[^h5771], and thou choosest[^h977] the tongue[^h3956] of the crafty[^h6175]. 
###### 6
Thine own mouth[^h6310] condemneth[^h7561] thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips[^h8193] testify[^h6030] against thee.
###### 7
Art thou the first[^h7223] [^h7223] man[^h120] that was born[^h3205]? or wast thou made[^h2342] before[^h6440] the hills[^h1389]?
###### 8
Hast thou heard[^h8085] the secret[^h5475] of God[^h433]? and dost thou restrain[^h1639] wisdom[^h2451] to thyself?
###### 9
What knowest[^h3045] thou, that we know[^h3045] not? what understandest[^h995] thou, which is not in us?
###### 10
With us are both the grayheaded[^h7867] and very aged[^h3453] men, much[^h3524] elder[^h3117] than thy father[^h1].
###### 11
Are the consolations[^h8575] of God[^h410] small[^h4592] with thee? is there any secret[^h328] thing[^h1697] with thee?
###### 12
Why doth thine heart[^h3820] carry thee away[^h3947]? and what do thy eyes[^h5869] wink at[^h7335],
###### 13
That thou turnest[^h7725] thy spirit[^h7307] against God[^h410], and lettest such words[^h4405] go out[^h3318] of thy mouth[^h6310]?
###### 14
What is man[^h582], that he should be clean[^h2135]? and he which is born[^h3205] of a woman[^h802], that he should be righteous[^h6663]?
###### 15
Behold, he putteth no trust[^h539] in his saints[^h6918]; yea, the heavens[^h8064] are not clean[^h2141] in his sight[^h5869].
###### 16
How much more abominable[^h8581] and filthy[^h444] is man[^h376], which drinketh[^h8354] iniquity[^h5766] [^h5766] like water[^h4325]?
###### 17
I will shew[^h2331] thee, hear[^h8085] me; and that which I have seen[^h2372] I will declare[^h5608];
###### 18
Which wise[^h2450] men have told[^h5046] from their fathers[^h1], and have not hid[^h3582] it:
###### 19
Unto whom alone the earth[^h776] was given[^h5414], and no stranger[^h2114] passed[^h5674] among[^h8432] them.
###### 20
The wicked[^h7563] man travaileth[^h2342] with pain all his days[^h3117], and the number[^h4557] of years[^h8141] is hidden[^h6845] to the oppressor[^h6184].
###### 21
A dreadful[^h6343] sound[^h6963] is in his ears[^h241]: in prosperity[^h7965] the destroyer[^h7703] shall come[^h935] upon him. 
###### 22
He believeth[^h539] not that he shall return[^h7725] out of darkness[^h2822], and he is waited[^h6822] for of the sword[^h2719].
###### 23
He wandereth abroad[^h5074] for bread[^h3899], saying, Where is it? he knoweth[^h3045] that the day[^h3117] of darkness[^h2822] is ready[^h3559] at his hand[^h3027].
###### 24
Trouble[^h6862] and anguish[^h4691] shall make him afraid[^h1204]; they shall prevail[^h8630] against him, as a king[^h4428] ready[^h6264] to the battle[^h3593].
###### 25
For he stretcheth out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] against God[^h410], and strengtheneth[^h1396] himself against the Almighty[^h7706].
###### 26
He runneth[^h7323] upon him, even on his neck[^h6677], upon the thick[^h5672] bosses[^h1354] of his bucklers[^h4043]:
###### 27
Because he covereth[^h3680] his face[^h6440] with his fatness[^h2459], and maketh[^h6213] collops of fat[^h6371] on his flanks[^h3689].
###### 28
And he dwelleth[^h7931] in desolate[^h3582] cities[^h5892], and in houses[^h1004] which no man inhabiteth[^h3427], which are ready[^h6257] to become heaps[^h1530].
###### 29
He shall not be rich[^h6238], neither shall his substance[^h2428] continue[^h6965], neither shall he prolong[^h5186] the perfection[^h4512] thereof upon the earth[^h776].
###### 30
He shall not depart[^h5493] out of darkness[^h2822]; the flame[^h7957] shall dry up[^h3001] his branches[^h3127], and by the breath[^h7307] of his mouth[^h6310] shall he go away[^h5493].
###### 31
Let not him that is deceived[^h8582] trust[^h539] in vanity[^h7723]: for vanity[^h7723] shall be his recompence[^h8545].
###### 32
It shall be accomplished[^h4390] before[^h3808] his time[^h3117], and his branch[^h3712] shall not be green[^h7488]. 
###### 33
He shall shake off[^h2554] his unripe grape[^h1154] as the vine[^h1612], and shall cast off[^h7993] his flower[^h5328] as the olive[^h2132].
###### 34
For the congregation[^h5712] of hypocrites[^h2611] shall be desolate[^h1565], and fire[^h784] shall consume[^h398] the tabernacles[^h168] of bribery[^h7810].
###### 35
They conceive[^h2029] mischief[^h5999], and bring forth[^h3205] vanity[^h205], and their belly[^h990] prepareth[^h3559] deceit[^h4820].

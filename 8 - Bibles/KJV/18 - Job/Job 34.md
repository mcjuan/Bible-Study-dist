###### 1
Furthermore Elihu[^h453] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
Hear[^h8085] my words[^h4405], O ye wise[^h2450] men; and give ear[^h238] unto me, ye that have knowledge[^h3045].
###### 3
For the ear[^h241] trieth[^h974] words[^h4405], as the mouth[^h2441] tasteth[^h2938] meat[^h398]. 
###### 4
Let us choose[^h977] to us judgment[^h4941]: let us know[^h3045] among ourselves what is good[^h2896].
###### 5
For Job[^h347] hath said[^h559], I am righteous[^h6663]: and God[^h410] hath taken away[^h5493] my judgment[^h4941].
###### 6
Should I lie[^h3576] against my right[^h4941]? my wound[^h2671] is incurable[^h605] without transgression[^h6588]. 
###### 7
What man[^h1397] is like Job[^h347], who drinketh up[^h8354] scorning[^h3933] like water[^h4325]?
###### 8
Which goeth[^h732] in company[^h2274] with the workers[^h6466] of iniquity[^h205], and walketh[^h3212] with wicked[^h7562] men[^h582].
###### 9
For he hath said[^h559], It profiteth[^h5532] a man[^h1397] nothing that he should delight[^h7521] himself with God[^h430].
###### 10
Therefore hearken[^h8085] unto me, ye men[^h582] of understanding[^h3824]: far be it[^h2486] from God[^h410], that he should do wickedness[^h7562]; and from the Almighty[^h7706], that he should commit iniquity[^h5766]. 
###### 11
For the work[^h6467] of a man[^h120] shall he render[^h7999] unto him, and cause every man[^h376] to find[^h4672] according to his ways[^h734].
###### 12
Yea, surely[^h551] God[^h410] will not do wickedly[^h7561], neither will the Almighty[^h7706] pervert[^h5791] judgment[^h4941].
###### 13
Who hath given him a charge[^h6485] over the earth[^h776]? or who hath disposed[^h7760] the whole world[^h8398]? 
###### 14
If he set[^h7760] his heart[^h3820] upon man, if he gather[^h622] unto himself his spirit[^h7307] and his breath[^h5397]; 
###### 15
All flesh[^h1320] shall perish[^h1478] together[^h3162], and man[^h120] shall turn again[^h7725] unto dust[^h6083].
###### 16
If now thou hast understanding[^h998], hear[^h8085] this: hearken[^h238] to the voice[^h6963] of my words[^h4405].
###### 17
Shall even he that hateth[^h8130] right[^h4941] govern[^h2280]? and wilt thou condemn[^h7561] him that is most[^h3524] just[^h6662]? 
###### 18
Is it fit to say[^h559] to a king[^h4428], Thou art wicked[^h1100]? and to princes[^h5081], Ye are ungodly[^h7563]?
###### 19
How much less to him that accepteth[^h5375] not the persons[^h6440] of princes[^h8269], nor regardeth[^h5234] the rich[^h7771] more than[^h6440] the poor[^h1800]? for they all are the work[^h4639] of his hands[^h3027].
###### 20
In a moment[^h7281] shall they die[^h4191], and the people[^h5971] shall be troubled[^h1607] at midnight[^h2676] [^h3915], and pass away[^h5674]: and the mighty[^h47] shall be taken away[^h5493] without hand[^h3027]. 
###### 21
For his eyes[^h5869] are upon the ways[^h1870] of man[^h376], and he seeth[^h7200] all his goings[^h6806].
###### 22
There is no darkness[^h2822], nor shadow of death[^h6757], where the workers[^h6466] of iniquity[^h205] may hide[^h5641] themselves.
###### 23
For he will not lay[^h7760] upon man[^h376] more than right; that he should enter[^h1980] into judgment[^h4941] with God[^h410]. 
###### 24
He shall break in pieces[^h7489] mighty men[^h3524] without number[^h2714], and set[^h5975] others[^h312] in their stead. 
###### 25
Therefore he knoweth[^h5234] their works[^h4566], and he overturneth[^h2015] them in the night[^h3915], so that they are destroyed[^h1792]. 
###### 26
He striketh[^h5606] them as[^h8478] wicked men[^h7563] in the open[^h4725] sight[^h7200] of others; 
###### 27
Because they turned back[^h5493] from him[^h310], and would not consider[^h7919] any of his ways[^h1870]: 
###### 28
So that they cause the cry[^h6818] of the poor[^h1800] to come[^h935] unto him, and he heareth[^h8085] the cry[^h6818] of the afflicted[^h6041].
###### 29
When he giveth quietness[^h8252], who then can make trouble[^h7561]? and when he hideth[^h5641] his face[^h6440], who then can behold[^h7789] him? whether it be done against a nation[^h1471], or against a man[^h120] only[^h3162]:
###### 30
That the hypocrite[^h120] [^h2611] reign[^h4427] not, lest the people[^h5971] be ensnared[^h4170].
###### 31
Surely it is meet to be said[^h559] unto God[^h410], I have borne[^h5375] chastisement, I will not offend[^h2254] any more:
###### 32
That which I see[^h2372] not[^h1107] teach[^h3384] thou me: if I have done[^h6466] iniquity[^h5766], I will do[^h3254] no more.
###### 33
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense[^h7999] it, whether thou refuse[^h3588] [^h3988], or whether thou choose[^h977]; and not I: therefore speak[^h1696] what thou knowest[^h3045]. 
###### 34
Let men[^h582] of understanding[^h3824] tell[^h559] me, and let a wise[^h2450] man[^h1397] hearken[^h8085] unto me. 
###### 35
Job[^h347] hath spoken[^h1696] without knowledge[^h1847], and his words[^h1697] were without wisdom[^h7919].
###### 36
My desire[^h15] [^h1] is that Job[^h347] may be tried[^h974] unto the end[^h5331] because of his answers[^h8666] for wicked[^h205] men[^h582]. 
###### 37
For he addeth[^h3254] rebellion[^h6588] unto his sin[^h2403], he clappeth[^h5606] his hands among us, and multiplieth[^h7235] his words[^h561] against God[^h410].

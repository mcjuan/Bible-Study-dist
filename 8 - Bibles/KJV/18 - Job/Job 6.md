###### 1
But Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
Oh that[^h3863] my grief[^h3708] were throughly[^h8254] weighed[^h8254], and my calamity[^h1942] [^h1962] laid[^h5375] in the balances[^h3976] together[^h3162]! 
###### 3
For now it would be heavier[^h3513] than the sand[^h2344] of the sea[^h3220]: therefore my words[^h1697] are swallowed up[^h3886]. 
###### 4
For the arrows[^h2671] of the Almighty[^h7706] are within[^h5978] me, the poison[^h2534] whereof drinketh up[^h8354] my spirit[^h7307]: the terrors[^h1161] of God[^h433] do set themselves in array[^h6186] against me.
###### 5
Doth the wild ass[^h6501] bray[^h5101] when he hath grass[^h1877]? or loweth[^h1600] the ox[^h7794] over his fodder[^h1098]? 
###### 6
Can that which is unsavoury[^h8602] be eaten[^h398] without salt[^h4417]? or is there[^h3426] any taste[^h2940] in the white[^h7388] of an egg[^h2495]?
###### 7
The things that my soul[^h5315] refused[^h3985] to touch[^h5060] are as my sorrowful[^h1741] meat[^h3899].
###### 8
Oh that I might have[^h935] my request[^h7596]; and that God[^h433] would grant[^h5414] me the thing that I long for[^h8615]! 
###### 9
Even that it would please[^h2974] God[^h433] to destroy[^h1792] me; that he would let loose[^h5425] his hand[^h3027], and cut me off[^h1214]!
###### 10
Then should I yet have comfort[^h5165]; yea, I would harden[^h5539] myself in sorrow[^h2427]: let him not spare[^h2550]; for I have not concealed[^h3582] the words[^h561] of the Holy One[^h6918].
###### 11
What is my strength[^h3581], that I should hope[^h3176]? and what is mine end[^h7093], that I should prolong[^h748] my life[^h5315]?
###### 12
Is my strength[^h3581] the strength[^h3581] of stones[^h68]? or is my flesh[^h1320] of brass[^h5153]? 
###### 13
Is not my help[^h5833] in me? and is wisdom[^h8454] driven quite[^h5080] from me?
###### 14
To him that is afflicted[^h4523] pity[^h2617] should be shewed from his friend[^h7453]; but he forsaketh[^h5800] the fear[^h3374] of the Almighty[^h7706]. 
###### 15
My brethren[^h251] have dealt deceitfully[^h898] as a brook[^h5158], and as the stream[^h650] of brooks[^h5158] they pass away[^h5674];
###### 16
Which are blackish[^h6937] by reason of the ice[^h7140], and wherein the snow[^h7950] is hid[^h5956]:
###### 17
What time[^h6256] they wax warm[^h2215], they vanish[^h6789]: when it is hot[^h2527], they are consumed out[^h1846] of their place[^h4725].   
###### 18
The paths[^h734] of their way[^h1870] are turned aside[^h3943]; they go[^h5927] to nothing[^h8414], and perish[^h6].
###### 19
The troops[^h734] of Tema[^h8485] looked[^h5027], the companies[^h1979] of Sheba[^h7614] waited[^h6960] for them.
###### 20
They were confounded[^h954] because they had hoped[^h982]; they came[^h935] thither, and were ashamed[^h2659].
###### 21
For now ye are nothing; ye see[^h7200] my casting down[^h2866], and are afraid[^h3372].  
###### 22
Did I say[^h559], Bring[^h3051] unto me? or, Give a reward[^h7809] for me of your substance[^h3581]?
###### 23
Or, Deliver[^h4422] me from the enemy's[^h6862] hand[^h3027]? or, Redeem[^h6299] me from the hand[^h3027] of the mighty[^h6184]?
###### 24
Teach[^h3384] me, and I will hold my tongue[^h2790]: and cause me to understand[^h995] wherein I have erred[^h7686].
###### 25
How forcible[^h4834] are right[^h3476] words[^h561]! but what doth your arguing[^h3198] reprove[^h3198]?
###### 26
Do ye imagine[^h2803] to reprove[^h3198] words[^h4405], and the speeches[^h561] of one that is desperate[^h2976], which are as wind[^h7307]?
###### 27
Yea, ye overwhelm[^h5307] the fatherless[^h3490], and ye dig[^h3738] a pit for your friend[^h7453]. 
###### 28
Now therefore be content[^h2974], look[^h6437] upon me; for it is evident[^h6440] unto you if I lie[^h3576]. 
###### 29
Return[^h7725], I pray you, let it not be iniquity[^h5766]; yea, return again[^h7725], my righteousness[^h6664] is in it. 
###### 30
Is there[^h3426] iniquity[^h5766] in my tongue[^h3956]? cannot my taste[^h2441] discern[^h995] perverse things[^h1942]?

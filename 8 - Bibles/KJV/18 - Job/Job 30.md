###### 1
But now they that are younger[^h6810] [^h3117] than I have me in derision[^h7832], whose fathers[^h1] I would have disdained[^h3988] to have set[^h7896] with the dogs[^h3611] of my flock[^h6629]. 
###### 2
Yea, whereto[^h4100] might the strength[^h3581] of their hands[^h3027] profit me, in whom old age[^h3624] was perished[^h6]?
###### 3
For want[^h2639] and famine[^h3720] they were solitary[^h1565]; fleeing[^h6207] into the wilderness[^h6723] in former time[^h570] desolate[^h7722] and waste[^h4875].  
###### 4
Who cut up[^h6998] mallows[^h4408] by the bushes[^h7880], and juniper[^h7574] roots[^h8328] for their meat[^h3899].
###### 5
They were driven forth[^h1644] from among[^h1460] men, (they cried[^h7321] after them as after a thief[^h1590];)
###### 6
To dwell[^h7931] in the clifts[^h6178] of the valleys[^h5158], in caves[^h2356] of the earth[^h6083], and in the rocks[^h3710]. 
###### 7
Among the bushes[^h7880] they brayed[^h5101]; under the nettles[^h2738] they were gathered together[^h5596].
###### 8
They were children[^h1121] of fools[^h5036], yea, children[^h1121] of base men[^h8034]: they were viler[^h5217] than the earth[^h776]. 
###### 9
And now am I their song[^h5058], yea, I am their byword[^h4405].
###### 10
They abhor[^h8581] me, they flee far[^h7368] from me, and spare[^h2820] not to spit[^h7536] in my face[^h6440]. 
###### 11
Because he hath loosed[^h6605] my cord[^h3499], and afflicted[^h6031] me, they have also let loose[^h7971] the bridle[^h7448] before[^h6440] me.
###### 12
Upon my right[^h3225] hand rise[^h6965] the youth[^h6526]; they push away[^h7971] my feet[^h7272], and they raise up[^h5549] against me the ways[^h734] of their destruction[^h343].
###### 13
They mar[^h5420] my path[^h5410], they set forward[^h3276] my calamity[^h1942] [^h1962], they have no helper[^h5826].
###### 14
They came[^h857] upon me as a wide[^h7342] breaking[^h6556] in of waters: in[^h8478] the desolation[^h7722] they rolled[^h1556] themselves upon me.
###### 15
Terrors[^h1091] are turned[^h2015] upon me: they pursue[^h7291] my soul[^h5082] as the wind[^h7307]: and my welfare[^h3444] passeth away[^h5674] as a cloud[^h5645]. 
###### 16
And now my soul[^h5315] is poured out[^h8210] upon me; the days[^h3117] of affliction[^h6040] have taken hold[^h270] upon me.
###### 17
My bones[^h6106] are pierced[^h5365] in me in the night season[^h3915]: and my sinews[^h6207] take no rest[^h7901].
###### 18
By the great[^h7230] force[^h3581] of my disease is my garment[^h3830] changed[^h2664]: it bindeth me about[^h247] as the collar[^h6310] of my coat[^h3801].
###### 19
He hath cast[^h3384] me into the mire[^h2563], and I am become like[^h4911] dust[^h6083] and ashes[^h665].
###### 20
I cry[^h7768] unto thee, and thou dost not hear[^h6030] me: I stand up[^h5975], and thou regardest[^h995] me not.
###### 21
Thou art become[^h2015] cruel[^h393] to me: with thy strong[^h6108] hand[^h3027] thou opposest[^h7852] thyself against me.  
###### 22
Thou liftest me up[^h5375] to the wind[^h7307]; thou causest me to ride[^h7392] upon it, and dissolvest[^h4127] my substance[^h8454] [^h7738]. 
###### 23
For I know[^h3045] that thou wilt bring[^h7725] me to death[^h4194], and to the house[^h1004] appointed[^h4150] for all living[^h2416].
###### 24
Howbeit he will not stretch out[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] to the grave[^h1164], though they cry[^h7769] in his destruction[^h6365]. 
###### 25
Did not I weep[^h1058] for him that was in trouble[^h7186] [^h3117]? was not my soul[^h5315] grieved[^h5701] for the poor[^h34]? 
###### 26
When I looked[^h6960] for good[^h2896], then evil[^h7451] came[^h935] unto me: and when I waited[^h3176] for light[^h216], there came[^h935] darkness[^h652].
###### 27
My bowels[^h4578] boiled[^h7570], and rested[^h1826] not: the days[^h3117] of affliction[^h6040] prevented[^h6923] me.
###### 28
I went[^h1980] mourning[^h6937] without the sun[^h2535]: I stood up[^h6965], and I cried[^h7768] in the congregation[^h6951].
###### 29
I am a brother[^h251] to dragons[^h8577], and a companion[^h7453] to owls[^h1323] [^h3284]. 
###### 30
My skin[^h5785] is black[^h7835] upon me, and my bones[^h6106] are burned[^h2787] with heat[^h2721].
###### 31
My harp[^h3658] also is turned to mourning[^h60], and my organ[^h5748] into the voice[^h6963] of them that weep[^h1058].

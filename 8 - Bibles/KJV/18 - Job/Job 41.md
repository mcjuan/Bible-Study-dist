###### 1
Canst thou draw out[^h4900] leviathan[^h3882] with an hook[^h2443]? or his tongue[^h3956] with a cord[^h2256] which thou lettest down[^h8257]?  
###### 2
Canst thou put[^h7760] an hook[^h100] into his nose[^h639]? or bore[^h5344] his jaw[^h3895] through with a thorn[^h2336]?
###### 3
Will he make many[^h7235] supplications[^h8469] unto thee? will he speak[^h1696] soft[^h7390] words unto thee?
###### 4
Will he make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with thee? wilt thou take[^h3947] him for a servant[^h5650] for ever[^h5769]?
###### 5
Wilt thou play[^h7832] with him as with a bird[^h6833]? or wilt thou bind[^h7194] him for thy maidens[^h5291]?
###### 6
Shall the companions[^h2271] make a banquet[^h3739] of him? shall they part[^h2673] him among the merchants[^h3669]?
###### 7
Canst thou fill[^h4390] his skin[^h5785] with barbed irons[^h7905]? or his head[^h7218] with fish[^h1709] spears[^h6767]?
###### 8
Lay[^h7760] thine hand[^h3709] upon him, remember[^h2142] the battle[^h4421], do no more[^h3254].
###### 9
Behold, the hope[^h8431] of him is in vain[^h3576]: shall not one be cast down[^h2904] even at the sight[^h4758] of him?
###### 10
None is so fierce[^h393] that dare stir him up[^h5782] [^h5782]: who then is able to stand[^h3320] before[^h6440] me?
###### 11
Who hath prevented[^h6923] me, that I should repay[^h7999] him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven[^h8064] is mine.
###### 12
I will not conceal[^h2790] his parts[^h907], nor his power[^h1369] [^h1697], nor his comely[^h2433] proportion[^h6187].
###### 13
Who can discover[^h1540] the face[^h6440] of his garment[^h3830]? or who can come[^h935] to him with his double[^h3718] bridle[^h7448]? 
###### 14
Who can open[^h6605] the doors[^h1817] of his face[^h6440]? his teeth[^h8127] are terrible[^h367] round about[^h5439].
###### 15
His scales[^h4043] [^h650] are his pride[^h1346], shut up together[^h5462] as with a close[^h6862] seal[^h2368]. 
###### 16
One[^h259] is so near[^h5066] to another[^h259], that no air[^h7307] can come[^h935] between them.
###### 17
They are joined[^h1692] one[^h376] to another[^h251], they stick together[^h3920], that they cannot be sundered[^h6504].
###### 18
By his neesings[^h5846] a light[^h216] doth shine[^h1984], and his eyes[^h5869] are like the eyelids[^h6079] of the morning[^h7837].
###### 19
Out of his mouth[^h6310] go[^h1980] burning lamps[^h3940], and sparks[^h3590] of fire[^h784] leap out[^h4422].
###### 20
Out of his nostrils[^h5156] goeth[^h3318] smoke[^h6227], as out of a seething[^h5301] pot[^h1731] or caldron[^h100].
###### 21
His breath[^h5315] kindleth[^h3857] coals[^h1513], and a flame[^h3851] goeth out[^h3318] of his mouth[^h6310].
###### 22
In his neck[^h6677] remaineth[^h3885] strength[^h5797], and sorrow[^h1670] is turned into joy[^h1750] before[^h6440] him. 
###### 23
The flakes[^h4651] of his flesh[^h1320] are joined together[^h1692]: they are firm[^h3332] in themselves; they cannot be moved[^h4131]. 
###### 24
His heart[^h3820] is as firm[^h3332] as a stone[^h68]; yea, as hard[^h3332] as a piece[^h6400] of the nether[^h8482] millstone.
###### 25
When he raiseth up[^h7613] himself, the mighty[^h352] are afraid[^h1481]: by reason of breakings[^h7667] they purify[^h2398] themselves.
###### 26
The sword[^h2719] of him that layeth[^h5381] at him cannot hold[^h6965]: the spear[^h2595], the dart[^h4551], nor the habergeon[^h8302]. 
###### 27
He esteemeth[^h2803] iron[^h1270] as straw[^h8401], and brass[^h5154] as rotten[^h7539] wood[^h6086].
###### 28
The arrow[^h1121] [^h7198] cannot make him flee[^h1272]: slingstones[^h68] [^h7050] are turned[^h2015] with him into stubble[^h7179].
###### 29
Darts[^h8455] are counted[^h2803] as stubble[^h7179]: he laugheth[^h7832] at the shaking[^h7494] of a spear[^h3591].
###### 30
Sharp[^h2303] stones[^h2789] are under him: he spreadeth[^h7502] sharp pointed things[^h2742] upon the mire[^h2916]. 
###### 31
He maketh the deep[^h4688] to boil[^h7570] like a pot[^h5518]: he maketh[^h7760] the sea[^h3220] like a pot of ointment[^h4841].
###### 32
He maketh a path[^h5410] to shine[^h215] after[^h310] him; one would think[^h2803] the deep[^h8415] to be hoary[^h7872].
###### 33
Upon earth[^h6083] there is not his like[^h4915], who is made[^h6213] without[^h1097] fear[^h2844]. 
###### 34
He beholdeth[^h7200] all high[^h1364] things: he is a king[^h4428] over all the children[^h1121] of pride[^h7830].

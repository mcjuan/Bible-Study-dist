###### 1
Moreover the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] Job[^h347], and said[^h559],
###### 2
Shall he that contendeth[^h7378] with the Almighty[^h7706] instruct[^h3250] him? he that reproveth[^h3198] God[^h433], let him answer[^h6030] it.
###### 3
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559],
###### 4
Behold, I am vile[^h7043]; what shall I answer[^h7725] thee? I will lay[^h7760] mine hand[^h3027] upon[^h3926] my mouth[^h6310].
###### 5
Once[^h259] have I spoken[^h1696]; but I will not answer[^h6030]: yea, twice[^h8147]; but I will proceed no further[^h3254].
###### 6
Then answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068] unto Job[^h347] out of the whirlwind[^h5591], and said[^h559],
###### 7
Gird up[^h247] thy loins[^h2504] now like a man[^h1397]: I will demand[^h7592] of thee, and declare[^h3045] thou unto me.
###### 8
Wilt thou also disannul[^h6565] my judgment[^h4941]? wilt thou condemn[^h7561] me, that thou mayest be righteous[^h6663]?
###### 9
Hast thou an arm[^h2220] like God[^h410]? or canst thou thunder[^h7481] with a voice[^h6963] like him?
###### 10
Deck[^h5710] thyself now with majesty[^h1347] and excellency[^h1363]; and array[^h3847] thyself with glory[^h1935] and beauty[^h1926].
###### 11
Cast abroad[^h6327] the rage[^h5678] of thy wrath[^h639]: and behold[^h7200] every one that is proud[^h1343], and abase[^h8213] him.
###### 12
Look[^h7200] on every one that is proud[^h1343], and bring him low[^h3665]; and tread down[^h1915] the wicked[^h7563] in their place.
###### 13
Hide[^h2934] them in the dust[^h6083] together[^h3162]; and bind[^h2280] their faces[^h6440] in secret[^h2934].
###### 14
Then will I also confess[^h3034] unto thee that thine own right hand[^h3225] can save[^h3467] thee.
###### 15
Behold now behemoth[^h930], which I made[^h6213] with thee; he eateth[^h398] grass[^h2682] as an ox[^h1241]. 
###### 16
Lo now, his strength[^h3581] is in his loins[^h4975], and his force[^h202] is in the navel[^h8306] of his belly[^h990].
###### 17
He moveth[^h2654] his tail[^h2180] like a cedar[^h730]: the sinews[^h1517] of his stones[^h6344] are wrapped together[^h8276]. 
###### 18
His bones[^h6106] are as strong[^h650] pieces of brass[^h5154]; his bones[^h1634] are like bars[^h4300] of iron[^h1270].
###### 19
He is the chief[^h7225] of the ways[^h1870] of God[^h410]: he that made[^h6213] him can make[^h5066] his sword[^h2719] to approach[^h5066] unto him.
###### 20
Surely the mountains[^h2022] bring him forth[^h5375] food[^h944], where all the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] play[^h7832].
###### 21
He lieth[^h7901] under the shady trees[^h6628], in the covert[^h5643] of the reed[^h7070], and fens[^h1207].
###### 22
The shady trees[^h6628] cover[^h5526] him with their shadow[^h6752]; the willows[^h6155] of the brook[^h5158] compass him about[^h5437].
###### 23
Behold, he drinketh up[^h6231] a river[^h5104], and hasteth[^h2648] not: he trusteth[^h982] that he can draw up[^h1518] Jordan[^h3383] into his mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 24
He taketh[^h3947] it with his eyes[^h5869]: his nose[^h639] pierceth through[^h5344] snares[^h4170].

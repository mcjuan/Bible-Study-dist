###### 1
Then answered[^h6030] Zophar[^h6691] the Naamathite[^h5284], and said[^h559],
###### 2
Therefore do my thoughts[^h5587] cause me to answer[^h7725], and for this I make haste[^h2363]. 
###### 3
I have heard[^h8085] the check[^h4148] of my reproach[^h3639], and the spirit[^h7307] of my understanding[^h998] causeth me to answer[^h6030].
###### 4
Knowest[^h3045] thou not this of old[^h5703], since man[^h120] was placed[^h7760] upon earth[^h776],
###### 5
That the triumphing[^h7445] of the wicked[^h7563] is short[^h7138], and the joy[^h8057] of the hypocrite[^h2611] but for a moment[^h7281]? 
###### 6
Though his excellency[^h7863] mount up[^h5927] to the heavens[^h8064], and his head[^h7218] reach[^h5060] unto the clouds[^h5645]; 
###### 7
Yet he shall perish[^h6] for ever[^h5331] like his own dung[^h1561]: they which have seen[^h7200] him shall say[^h559], Where[^h335] is he?
###### 8
He shall fly away[^h5774] as a dream[^h2472], and shall not be found[^h4672]: yea, he shall be chased away[^h5074] as a vision[^h2384] of the night[^h3915].
###### 9
The eye[^h5869] also which saw[^h7805] him shall see him no more[^h3254]; neither shall his place[^h4725] any more behold[^h7789] him.
###### 10
His children[^h1121] shall seek to please[^h7521] the poor[^h1800], and his hands[^h3027] shall restore[^h7725] their goods[^h202]. 
###### 11
His bones[^h6106] are full[^h4390] of the sin of his youth[^h5934], which shall lie down[^h7901] with him in the dust[^h6083].
###### 12
Though wickedness[^h7451] be sweet[^h4985] in his mouth[^h6310], though he hide[^h3582] it under his tongue[^h3956];
###### 13
Though he spare[^h2550] it, and forsake[^h5800] it not; but keep it still[^h4513] within[^h8432] his mouth[^h2441]: 
###### 14
Yet his meat[^h3899] in his bowels[^h4578] is turned[^h2015], it is the gall[^h4846] of asps[^h6620] within[^h7130] him.
###### 15
He hath swallowed down[^h1104] riches[^h2428], and he shall vomit them up again[^h6958]: God[^h410] shall cast them out[^h3423] of his belly[^h990].
###### 16
He shall suck[^h3243] the poison[^h7219] of asps[^h6620]: the viper's[^h660] tongue[^h3956] shall slay[^h2026] him.
###### 17
He shall not see[^h7200] the rivers[^h6390], the floods[^h5104], the brooks[^h5158] of honey[^h1706] and butter[^h2529]. 
###### 18
That which he laboured[^h3022] for shall he restore[^h7725], and shall not swallow it down[^h1104]: according to his substance[^h2428] shall the restitution[^h8545] be, and he shall not rejoice[^h5965] therein. 
###### 19
Because he hath oppressed[^h7533] and hath forsaken[^h5800] the poor[^h1800]; because he hath violently taken away[^h1497] an house[^h1004] which he builded[^h1129] not; 
###### 20
Surely he shall not feel[^h3045] quietness[^h7961] in his belly[^h990], he shall not save[^h4422] of that which he desired[^h2530]. 
###### 21
There shall none of his meat[^h400] be left[^h8300]; therefore shall no man look[^h2342] for his goods[^h2898]. 
###### 22
In the fulness[^h4390] [^h4390] of his sufficiency[^h5607] he shall be in straits[^h3334]: every hand[^h3027] of the wicked[^h6001] shall come[^h935] upon him. 
###### 23
When he is about to fill[^h4390] his belly[^h990], God shall cast[^h7971] the fury[^h2740] of his wrath[^h639] upon him, and shall rain[^h4305] it upon him while he is eating[^h3894].
###### 24
He shall flee[^h1272] from the iron[^h1270] weapon[^h5402], and the bow[^h7198] of steel[^h5154] shall strike him through[^h2498].
###### 25
It is drawn[^h8025], and cometh out[^h3318] of the body[^h1465]; yea, the glittering sword[^h1300] cometh out[^h1980] of his gall[^h4846]: terrors[^h367] are upon him.
###### 26
All darkness[^h2822] shall be hid[^h2934] in his secret places[^h6845]: a fire[^h784] not blown[^h5301] shall consume[^h398] him; it shall go ill[^h3415] with him that is left[^h8300] in his tabernacle[^h168].
###### 27
The heaven[^h8064] shall reveal[^h1540] his iniquity[^h5771]; and the earth[^h776] shall rise up[^h6965] against him.
###### 28
The increase[^h2981] of his house[^h1004] shall depart[^h1540], and his goods shall flow away[^h5064] in the day[^h3117] of his wrath[^h639].
###### 29
This is the portion[^h2506] of a wicked[^h7563] man[^h120] from God[^h430], and the heritage[^h5159] appointed[^h561] unto him by God[^h410].

###### 1
Moreover Job[^h347] continued[^h3254] [^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], 
###### 2
Oh that[^h5414] I were as in months[^h3391] past[^h6924], as in the days[^h3117] when God[^h433] preserved[^h8104] me;
###### 3
When his candle[^h5216] shined[^h1984] upon my head[^h7218], and when by his light[^h216] I walked[^h3212] through darkness[^h2822]; 
###### 4
As I was in the days[^h3117] of my youth[^h2779], when the secret[^h5475] of God[^h433] was upon my tabernacle[^h168];
###### 5
When the Almighty[^h7706] was yet with me, when my children[^h5288] were about[^h5439] me;
###### 6
When I washed[^h7364] my steps[^h1978] with butter[^h2529], and the rock[^h6697] poured me out[^h6694] rivers[^h6388] of oil[^h8081]; 
###### 7
When I went out[^h3318] to the gate[^h8179] through the city[^h7176], when I prepared[^h3559] my seat[^h4186] in the street[^h7339]!
###### 8
The young men[^h5288] saw[^h7200] me, and hid[^h2244] themselves: and the aged[^h3453] arose[^h6965], and stood up[^h5975].
###### 9
The princes[^h8269] refrained[^h6113] talking[^h4405], and laid[^h7760] their hand[^h3709] on their mouth[^h6310].
###### 10
The nobles[^h5057] held[^h2244] their peace[^h6963], and their tongue[^h3956] cleaved[^h1692] to the roof of their mouth[^h2441]. 
###### 11
When the ear[^h241] heard[^h8085] me, then it blessed[^h833] me; and when the eye[^h5869] saw[^h7200] me, it gave witness[^h5749] to me:
###### 12
Because I delivered[^h4422] the poor[^h6041] that cried[^h7768], and the fatherless[^h3490], and him that had none to help[^h5826] him.
###### 13
The blessing[^h1293] of him that was ready to perish[^h6] came[^h935] upon me: and I caused the widow's[^h490] heart[^h3820] to sing for joy[^h7442].
###### 14
I put[^h3847] on righteousness[^h6664], and it clothed[^h3847] me: my judgment[^h4941] was as a robe[^h4598] and a diadem[^h6797].
###### 15
I was eyes[^h5869] to the blind[^h5787], and feet[^h7272] was I to the lame[^h6455].
###### 16
I was a father[^h1] to the poor[^h34]: and the cause[^h7379] which I knew[^h3045] not I searched out[^h2713].
###### 17
And I brake[^h7665] the jaws[^h4973] of the wicked[^h5767], and plucked[^h7993] the spoil[^h2964] out of his teeth[^h8127].  
###### 18
Then I said[^h559], I shall die[^h1478] in my nest[^h7064], and I shall multiply[^h7235] my days[^h3117] as the sand[^h2344].
###### 19
My root[^h8328] was spread out[^h6605] by the waters[^h4325], and the dew[^h2919] lay all night[^h3885] upon my branch[^h7105]. 
###### 20
My glory[^h3519] was fresh[^h2319] in me[^h5978], and my bow[^h7198] was renewed[^h2498] in my hand[^h3027].  
###### 21
Unto me men gave ear[^h8085], and waited[^h3176], and kept silence[^h1826] at[^h3926] my counsel[^h6098].
###### 22
After[^h310] my words[^h1697] they spake not again[^h8138]; and my speech[^h4405] dropped[^h5197] upon them.
###### 23
And they waited[^h3176] for me as for the rain[^h4306]; and they opened[^h6473] their mouth[^h6310] wide as for the latter rain[^h4456].
###### 24
If I laughed[^h7832] on them, they believed[^h539] it not; and the light[^h216] of my countenance[^h6440] they cast not down[^h5307].
###### 25
I chose[^h977] out their way[^h1870], and sat[^h3427] chief[^h7218], and dwelt[^h7931] as a king[^h4428] in the army[^h1416], as one that comforteth[^h5162] the mourners[^h57].

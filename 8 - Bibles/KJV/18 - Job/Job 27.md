###### 1
Moreover Job[^h347] continued[^h3254] [^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], 
###### 2
As God[^h410] liveth[^h2416], who hath taken away[^h5493] my judgment[^h4941]; and the Almighty[^h7706], who hath vexed[^h4843] my soul[^h5315]; 
###### 3
All the while[^h5750] my breath[^h5397] is in me, and the spirit[^h7307] of God[^h433] is in my nostrils[^h639]; 
###### 4
My lips[^h8193] shall not speak[^h1696] wickedness[^h5766], nor my tongue[^h3956] utter[^h1897] deceit[^h7423].
###### 5
God forbid[^h2486] that I should justify[^h6663] you: till I die[^h1478] I will not remove[^h5493] mine integrity[^h8538] from me.
###### 6
My righteousness[^h6666] I hold[^h2388] fast, and will not let it go[^h7503]: my heart[^h3824] shall not reproach[^h2778] me so long as I live[^h3117]. 
###### 7
Let mine enemy[^h341] be as the wicked[^h7563], and he that riseth up[^h6965] against me as the unrighteous[^h5767].
###### 8
For what is the hope[^h8615] of the hypocrite[^h2611], though he hath gained[^h1214], when God[^h433] taketh away[^h7953] his soul[^h5315]?
###### 9
Will God[^h410] hear[^h8085] his cry[^h6818] when trouble[^h6869] cometh[^h935] upon him?
###### 10
Will he delight[^h6026] himself in the Almighty[^h7706]? will he always[^h6256] call[^h7121] upon God[^h433]?
###### 11
I will teach[^h3384] you by the hand[^h3027] of God[^h410]: that which is with the Almighty[^h7706] will I not conceal[^h3582]. 
###### 12
Behold, all ye yourselves have seen[^h2372] it; why then are ye thus altogether[^h1892] vain[^h1891]?
###### 13
This is the portion[^h2506] of a wicked[^h7563] man[^h120] with God[^h410], and the heritage[^h5159] of oppressors[^h6184], which they shall receive[^h3947] of the Almighty[^h7706].
###### 14
If his children[^h1121] be multiplied[^h7235], it is for[^h3926] the sword[^h2719]: and his offspring[^h6631] shall not be satisfied[^h7646] with bread[^h3899].
###### 15
Those that remain[^h8300] of him shall be buried[^h6912] in death[^h4194]: and his widows[^h490] shall not weep[^h1058].
###### 16
Though he heap up[^h6651] silver[^h3701] as the dust[^h6083], and prepare[^h3559] raiment[^h4403] as the clay[^h2563];
###### 17
He may prepare[^h3559] it, but the just[^h6662] shall put it on[^h3847], and the innocent[^h5355] shall divide[^h2505] the silver[^h3701].
###### 18
He buildeth[^h1129] his house[^h1004] as a moth[^h6211], and as a booth[^h5521] that the keeper[^h5341] maketh[^h6213].
###### 19
The rich[^h6223] man shall lie down[^h7901], but he shall not be gathered[^h622]: he openeth[^h6491] his eyes[^h5869], and he is not.
###### 20
Terrors[^h1091] take hold[^h5381] on him as waters[^h4325], a tempest[^h5492] stealeth him away[^h1589] in the night[^h3915].
###### 21
The east[^h6921] wind carrieth him away[^h5375], and he departeth[^h3212]: and as a storm hurleth[^h8175] him out of his place[^h4725].
###### 22
For God shall cast[^h7993] upon him, and not spare[^h2550]: he would fain[^h1272] flee[^h1272] out of his hand[^h3027]. 
###### 23
Men shall clap[^h5606] their hands[^h3709] at him, and shall hiss[^h8319] him out of his place[^h4725].

###### 1
I made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with mine eyes[^h5869]; why then should I think[^h995] upon a maid[^h1330]?
###### 2
For what portion[^h2506] of God[^h433] is there from above[^h4605]? and what inheritance[^h5159] of the Almighty[^h7706] from on high[^h4791]?
###### 3
Is not destruction[^h343] to the wicked[^h5767]? and a strange[^h5235] punishment to the workers[^h6466] of iniquity[^h205]?
###### 4
Doth not he see[^h7200] my ways[^h1870], and count[^h5608] all my steps[^h6806]?
###### 5
If I have walked[^h1980] with vanity[^h7723], or if my foot[^h7272] hath hasted[^h2363] to deceit[^h4820];
###### 6
Let me be weighed[^h8254] in an even[^h6664] balance[^h3976], that God[^h433] may know[^h3045] mine integrity[^h8538]. 
###### 7
If my step[^h838] hath turned out[^h5186] of the way[^h1870], and mine heart[^h3820] walked[^h1980] after[^h310] mine eyes[^h5869], and if any blot[^h3971] hath cleaved[^h1692] to mine hands[^h3709];
###### 8
Then let me sow[^h2232], and let another[^h312] eat[^h398]; yea, let my offspring[^h6631] be rooted out[^h8327].
###### 9
If mine heart[^h3820] have been deceived[^h6601] by a woman[^h802], or if I have laid wait[^h693] at my neighbour's[^h7453] door[^h6607];
###### 10
Then let my wife[^h802] grind[^h2912] unto another[^h312], and let others[^h312] bow down[^h3766] upon her.
###### 11
For this is an heinous crime[^h2154]; yea, it is an iniquity[^h5771] to be punished by the judges[^h6414].
###### 12
For it is a fire[^h784] that consumeth[^h398] to destruction[^h11], and would root out[^h8327] all mine increase[^h8393].
###### 13
If I did despise[^h3988] the cause[^h4941] of my manservant[^h5650] or of my maidservant[^h519], when they contended[^h7379] with me;
###### 14
What then shall I do[^h6213] when God[^h410] riseth up[^h6965]? and when he visiteth[^h6485], what shall I answer[^h7725] him?
###### 15
Did not he that made[^h6213] me in the womb[^h990] make[^h6213] him? and did not one[^h259] fashion[^h3559] us in the womb[^h7358]? 
###### 16
If I have withheld[^h4513] the poor[^h1800] from their desire[^h2656], or have caused the eyes[^h5869] of the widow[^h490] to fail[^h3615];
###### 17
Or have eaten[^h398] my morsel[^h6595] myself alone, and the fatherless[^h3490] hath not eaten[^h398] thereof;
###### 18
(For from my youth[^h5271] he was brought up[^h1431] with me, as with a father[^h1], and I have guided[^h5148] her from my mother's[^h517] womb[^h990];) 
###### 19
If I have seen[^h7200] any perish[^h6] for want of clothing[^h3830], or any poor[^h34] without covering[^h3682];
###### 20
If his loins[^h2504] have not blessed[^h1288] me, and if he were not warmed[^h2552] with the fleece[^h1488] of my sheep[^h3532];
###### 21
If I have lifted up[^h5130] my hand[^h3027] against the fatherless[^h3490], when I saw[^h7200] my help[^h5833] in the gate[^h8179]:
###### 22
Then let mine arm[^h3802] fall[^h5307] from my shoulder blade[^h7929], and mine arm[^h248] be broken[^h7665] from the bone[^h7070]. 
###### 23
For destruction[^h343] from God[^h410] was a terror[^h6343] to me, and by reason of his highness[^h7613] I could[^h3201] not endure.
###### 24
If I have made[^h7760] gold[^h2091] my hope[^h3689], or have said[^h559] to the fine gold[^h3800], Thou art my confidence[^h4009];
###### 25
If I rejoiced[^h8055] because my wealth[^h2428] was great[^h7227], and because mine hand[^h3027] had gotten[^h4672] much[^h3524]; 
###### 26
If I beheld[^h7200] the sun[^h216] when it shined[^h1984], or the moon[^h3394] walking[^h1980] in brightness[^h3368];  
###### 27
And my heart[^h3820] hath been secretly[^h5643] enticed[^h6601], or my mouth[^h6310] hath kissed[^h5401] my hand[^h3027]: 
###### 28
This also were an iniquity[^h5771] to be punished by the judge[^h6416]: for I should have denied[^h3584] the God[^h410] that is above[^h4605].
###### 29
If I rejoiced[^h8055] at the destruction[^h6365] of him that hated[^h8130] me, or lifted up[^h5782] myself when evil[^h7451] found[^h4672] him:
###### 30
Neither have I suffered[^h5414] my mouth[^h2441] to sin[^h2398] by wishing[^h7592] a curse[^h423] to his soul[^h5315]. 
###### 31
If the men[^h4962] of my tabernacle[^h168] said[^h559] not, Oh that we had[^h5414] of his flesh[^h1320]! we cannot be satisfied[^h7646].
###### 32
The stranger[^h1616] did not lodge[^h3885] in the street[^h2351]: but I opened[^h6605] my doors[^h1817] to the traveller[^h734]. 
###### 33
If I covered[^h3680] my transgressions[^h6588] as Adam[^h121], by hiding[^h2934] mine iniquity[^h5771] in my bosom[^h2243]: 
###### 34
Did I fear[^h6206] a great[^h7227] multitude[^h1995], or did the contempt[^h937] of families[^h4940] terrify[^h2865] me, that I kept silence[^h1826], and went not out[^h3318] of the door[^h6607]?
###### 35
Oh that[^h5414] one would hear[^h8085] me! behold, my desire[^h8420] is, that the Almighty[^h7706] would answer[^h6030] me, and that mine adversary[^h376] [^h7379] had written[^h3789] a book[^h5612]. 
###### 36
Surely I would take[^h5375] it upon my shoulder[^h7926], and bind[^h6029] it as a crown[^h5850] to me.
###### 37
I would declare[^h5046] unto him the number[^h4557] of my steps[^h6806]; as a prince[^h5057] would I go near[^h7126] unto him.
###### 38
If my land[^h127] cry[^h2199] against me, or that the furrows[^h8525] likewise[^h3162] thereof complain[^h1058]; 
###### 39
If I have eaten[^h398] the fruits[^h3581] thereof without money[^h3701], or have caused the owners[^h1167] thereof to lose[^h5301] their life[^h5315]:  
###### 40
Let thistles[^h2336] grow[^h3318] instead of wheat[^h2406], and cockle[^h890] instead of barley[^h8184]. The words[^h1697] of Job[^h347] are ended[^h8552].

###### 1
Why, seeing times[^h6256] are not hidden[^h6845] from the Almighty[^h7706], do they that know[^h3045] him not see[^h2372] his days[^h3117]?
###### 2
Some remove[^h5381] the landmarks[^h1367]; they violently take away[^h1497] flocks[^h5739], and feed[^h7462] thereof. 
###### 3
They drive away[^h5090] the ass[^h2543] of the fatherless[^h3490], they take[^h2254] the widow's[^h490] ox[^h7794] for a pledge[^h2254].
###### 4
They turn[^h5186] the needy[^h34] out of the way[^h1870]: the poor[^h6041] [^h6035] of the earth[^h776] hide[^h2244] themselves together[^h3162].
###### 5
Behold, as wild asses[^h6501] in the desert[^h4057], go they forth[^h3318] to their work[^h6467]; rising betimes[^h7836] for a prey[^h2964]: the wilderness[^h6160] yieldeth food[^h3899] for them and for their children[^h5288].
###### 6
They reap[^h7114] [^h7114] every one his corn[^h1098] in the field[^h7704]: and they gather[^h3953] the vintage[^h3754] of the wicked[^h7563].  
###### 7
They cause the naked[^h6174] to lodge[^h3885] without clothing[^h3830], that they have no covering[^h3682] in the cold[^h7135].
###### 8
They are wet[^h7372] with the showers[^h2230] of the mountains[^h2022], and embrace[^h2263] the rock[^h6697] for want of a shelter[^h4268].
###### 9
They pluck[^h1497] the fatherless[^h3490] from the breast[^h7699], and take a pledge[^h2254] of the poor[^h6041].
###### 10
They cause him to go[^h1980] naked[^h6174] without clothing[^h3830], and they take away[^h5375] the sheaf[^h6016] from the hungry[^h7457];
###### 11
Which make oil[^h6671] within[^h996] their walls[^h7791], and tread[^h1869] their winepresses[^h3342], and suffer thirst[^h6770].
###### 12
Men[^h4962] groan[^h5008] from out of the city[^h5892], and the soul[^h5315] of the wounded[^h2491] crieth out[^h7768]: yet God[^h433] layeth[^h7760] not folly[^h8604] to them.
###### 13
They are of those that rebel[^h4775] against the light[^h216]; they know[^h5234] not the ways[^h1870] thereof, nor abide[^h3427] in the paths[^h5410] thereof.
###### 14
The murderer[^h7523] rising[^h6965] with the light[^h216] killeth[^h6991] the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34], and in the night[^h3915] is as a thief[^h1590].
###### 15
The eye[^h5869] also of the adulterer[^h5003] waiteth[^h8104] for the twilight[^h5399], saying[^h559], No eye[^h5869] shall see[^h7789] me: and disguiseth[^h5643] [^h7760] his face[^h6440]. 
###### 16
In the dark[^h2822] they dig through[^h2864] houses[^h1004], which they had marked[^h2856] for themselves in the daytime[^h3119]: they know[^h3045] not the light[^h216].
###### 17
For the morning[^h1242] is to them even as[^h3162] the shadow of death[^h6757]: if one know[^h5234] them, they are in the terrors[^h1091] of the shadow of death[^h6757].
###### 18
He is swift[^h7031] as the waters[^h6440] [^h4325]; their portion[^h2513] is cursed[^h7043] in the earth[^h776]: he beholdeth[^h6437] not the way[^h1870] of the vineyards[^h3754].
###### 19
Drought[^h6723] and heat[^h2527] consume[^h1497] the snow[^h7950] waters[^h4325]: so doth the grave[^h7585] those which have sinned[^h2398]. 
###### 20
The womb[^h7358] shall forget[^h7911] him; the worm[^h7415] shall feed sweetly[^h4988] on him; he shall be no more remembered[^h2142]; and wickedness[^h5766] shall be broken[^h7665] as a tree[^h6086].
###### 21
He evil entreateth[^h7462] the barren[^h6135] that beareth[^h3205] not: and doeth not good[^h3190] to the widow[^h490].
###### 22
He draweth[^h4900] also the mighty[^h47] with his power[^h3581]: he riseth up[^h6965], and no man is sure[^h539] of life[^h2416]. 
###### 23
Though it be given[^h5414] him to be in safety[^h983], whereon he resteth[^h8172]; yet his eyes[^h5869] are upon their ways[^h1870].
###### 24
They are exalted[^h7426] for a little while[^h4592], but are gone and brought low[^h4355]; they are taken out[^h7092] of the way[^h1870] as all other, and cut off[^h5243] as the tops[^h7218] of the ears of corn[^h7641].  
###### 25
And if it be not so now[^h645], who will make[^h7760] me a liar[^h3576], and make[^h7760] my speech[^h4405] nothing worth[^h408]?

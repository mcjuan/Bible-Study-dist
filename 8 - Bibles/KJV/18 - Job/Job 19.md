###### 1
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
How long will ye vex[^h3013] my soul[^h5315], and break[^h1792] me in pieces with words[^h4405]?
###### 3
These ten[^h6235] times[^h6471] have ye reproached[^h3637] me: ye are not ashamed[^h954] that ye make yourselves strange[^h1970] to me. 
###### 4
And be it indeed[^h551] that I have erred[^h7686], mine error[^h4879] remaineth[^h3885] with myself.
###### 5
If indeed[^h551] ye will magnify[^h1431] yourselves against me, and plead[^h3198] against me my reproach[^h2781]:
###### 6
Know[^h3045] now[^h645] that God[^h433] hath overthrown[^h5791] me, and hath compassed[^h5362] me with his net[^h4686].
###### 7
Behold, I cry out[^h6817] of wrong[^h2555], but I am not heard[^h6030]: I cry aloud[^h7768], but there is no judgment[^h4941]. 
###### 8
He hath fenced up[^h1443] my way[^h734] that I cannot pass[^h5674], and he hath set[^h7760] darkness[^h2822] in my paths[^h5410].
###### 9
He hath stripped[^h6584] me of my glory[^h3519], and taken[^h5493] the crown[^h5850] from my head[^h7218].
###### 10
He hath destroyed[^h5422] me on every side[^h5439], and I am gone[^h3212]: and mine hope[^h8615] hath he removed[^h5265] like a tree[^h6086].
###### 11
He hath also kindled[^h2734] his wrath[^h639] against me, and he counteth[^h2803] me unto him as one of his enemies[^h6862].
###### 12
His troops[^h1416] come[^h935] together[^h3162], and raise up[^h5549] their way[^h1870] against me, and encamp[^h2583] round about[^h5439] my tabernacle[^h168].
###### 13
He hath put[^h7368] my brethren[^h251] far[^h7368] from me, and mine acquaintance[^h3045] are verily estranged[^h2114] from me.
###### 14
My kinsfolk[^h7138] have failed[^h2308], and my familiar friends[^h3045] have forgotten[^h7911] me.
###### 15
They that dwell[^h1481] in mine house[^h1004], and my maids[^h519], count[^h2803] me for a stranger[^h2114]: I am an alien[^h5237] in their sight[^h5869].
###### 16
I called[^h7121] my servant[^h5650], and he gave me no answer[^h6030]; I intreated[^h2603] him with[^h1119] my mouth[^h6310].
###### 17
My breath[^h7307] is strange[^h2114] to my wife[^h802], though I intreated[^h2589] for the children's[^h1121] sake of mine own body[^h990]. 
###### 18
Yea, young children[^h5759] despised[^h3988] me; I arose[^h6965], and they spake[^h1696] against me. 
###### 19
All my inward[^h5475] friends[^h4962] abhorred[^h8581] me: and they whom I loved[^h157] are turned[^h2015] against me. 
###### 20
My bone[^h6106] cleaveth[^h1692] to my skin[^h5785] and to my flesh[^h1320], and I am escaped[^h4422] with the skin[^h5785] of my teeth[^h8127]. 
###### 21
Have pity[^h2603] upon me, have pity[^h2603] upon me, O ye my friends[^h7453]; for the hand[^h3027] of God[^h433] hath touched[^h5060] me.
###### 22
Why do ye persecute[^h7291] me as God[^h410], and are not satisfied[^h7646] with my flesh[^h1320]?
###### 23
Oh that[^h5414] my words[^h4405] were now[^h645] written[^h3789]! oh that[^h5414] they were printed[^h2710] in a book[^h5612]! 
###### 24
That they were graven[^h2672] with an iron[^h1270] pen[^h5842] and lead[^h5777] in the rock[^h6697] for ever[^h5703]!
###### 25
For I know[^h3045] that my redeemer[^h1350] liveth[^h2416], and that he shall stand[^h6965] at the latter[^h314] day upon the earth[^h6083]:
###### 26
And though after[^h310] my skin[^h5785] worms destroy[^h5362] this body, yet in my flesh[^h1320] shall I see[^h2372] God[^h433]: 
###### 27
Whom I shall see[^h2372] for myself, and mine eyes[^h5869] shall behold[^h7200], and not another[^h2114]; though my reins[^h3629] be consumed[^h3615] within[^h2436] me.   
###### 28
But ye should say[^h559], Why persecute[^h7291] we him, seeing the root[^h8328] of the matter[^h1697] is found[^h4672] in me? 
###### 29
Be ye afraid[^h1481] of the sword[^h2719]: for wrath[^h2534] bringeth the punishments[^h5771] of[^h6440] the sword[^h2719], that ye may know[^h3045] there is a judgment[^h1779] [^h1779].

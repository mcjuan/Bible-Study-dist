###### 1
Again there was a day[^h3117] when the sons[^h1121] of God[^h430] came[^h935] to present[^h3320] themselves before the LORD[^h3068], and Satan[^h7854] came[^h935] also among[^h8432] them to present[^h3320] himself before the LORD[^h3068].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], From whence[^h335] comest[^h935] thou? And Satan[^h7854] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], From going to and fro[^h7751] in the earth[^h776], and from walking up and down[^h1980] in it.
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], Hast thou[^h7760] considered[^h3820] my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347], that there is none like him in the earth[^h776], a perfect[^h8535] and an upright[^h3477] man[^h376], one that feareth[^h3373] God[^h430], and escheweth[^h5493] evil[^h7451]? and still he holdeth fast[^h2388] his integrity[^h8538], although thou movedst[^h5496] me against him, to destroy[^h1104] him without cause[^h2600]. 
###### 4
And Satan[^h7854] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Skin[^h5785] for skin[^h5785], yea, all that a man[^h376] hath will he give[^h5414] for his life[^h5315].
###### 5
But[^h199] put forth[^h7971] thine hand[^h3027] now, and touch[^h5060] his bone[^h6106] and his flesh[^h1320], and he will curse[^h1288] thee to thy face[^h6440].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], Behold, he is in thine hand[^h3027]; but save[^h8104] his life[^h5315]. 
###### 7
So went[^h3318] Satan[^h7854] forth[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], and smote[^h5221] Job[^h347] with sore[^h7451] boils[^h7822] from the sole[^h3709] of his foot[^h7272] unto his crown[^h6936].
###### 8
And he took[^h3947] him a potsherd[^h2789] to scrape[^h1623] himself withal; and he sat down[^h3427] among[^h8432] the ashes[^h665].
###### 9
Then said[^h559] his wife[^h802] unto him, Dost thou still retain[^h2388] thine integrity[^h8538]? curse[^h1288] God[^h430], and die[^h4191].
###### 10
But he said[^h559] unto her, Thou speakest[^h1696] as one[^h259] of the foolish women[^h5036] speaketh[^h1696]. What[^h1571]? shall we receive[^h6901] good[^h2896] at the hand of God[^h430], and shall we not receive[^h6901] evil[^h7451]? In all this did not Job[^h347] sin[^h2398] with his lips[^h8193].
###### 11
Now when Job's[^h347] three[^h7969] friends[^h7453] heard[^h8085] of all this evil[^h7451] that was come[^h935] upon him, they came[^h935] every one[^h376] from his own place[^h4725]; Eliphaz[^h464] the Temanite[^h8489], and Bildad[^h1085] the Shuhite[^h7747], and Zophar[^h6691] the Naamathite[^h5284]: for they had made an appointment[^h3259] together[^h3162] to come[^h935] to mourn[^h5110] with him and to comfort[^h5162] him.
###### 12
And when they lifted up[^h5375] their eyes[^h5869] afar off[^h7350], and knew[^h5234] him not, they lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058]; and they rent[^h7167] every one[^h376] his mantle[^h4598], and sprinkled[^h2236] dust[^h6083] upon their heads[^h7218] toward heaven[^h8064].
###### 13
So they sat down[^h3427] with him upon the ground[^h776] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] and seven[^h7651] nights[^h3915], and none spake[^h1696] a word[^h1697] unto him: for they saw[^h7200] that his grief[^h3511] was very[^h3966] great[^h1431].

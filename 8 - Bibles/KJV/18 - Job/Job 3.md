###### 1
After[^h310] this opened[^h6605] Job[^h347] his mouth[^h6310], and cursed[^h7043] his day[^h3117].
###### 2
And Job[^h347] spake[^h6030], and said[^h559], 
###### 3
Let the day[^h3117] perish[^h6] wherein I was born[^h3205], and the night[^h3915] in which it was said[^h559], There is a man child[^h1397] conceived[^h2029].
###### 4
Let that day[^h3117] be darkness[^h2822]; let not God[^h433] regard[^h1875] it from above[^h4605], neither let the light[^h5105] shine[^h3313] upon it.
###### 5
Let darkness[^h2822] and the shadow of death[^h6757] stain[^h1350] it; let a cloud[^h6053] dwell[^h7931] upon it; let the blackness[^h3650] of the day[^h3117] terrify[^h1204] it.  
###### 6
As for that night[^h3915], let darkness[^h652] seize[^h3947] upon it; let it not be joined[^h2302] unto the days[^h3117] of the year[^h8141], let it not come[^h935] into the number[^h4557] of the months[^h3391]. 
###### 7
Lo, let that night[^h3915] be solitary[^h1565], let no joyful voice[^h7445] come[^h935] therein.
###### 8
Let them curse[^h5344] it that curse[^h779] the day[^h3117], who are ready[^h6264] to raise up[^h5782] their mourning[^h3882]. 
###### 9
Let the stars[^h3556] of the twilight[^h5399] thereof be dark[^h2821]; let it look[^h6960] for light[^h216], but have none; neither let it see[^h7200] the dawning[^h6079] of the day[^h7837]: 
###### 10
Because it shut not up[^h5462] the doors[^h1817] of my mother's womb[^h990], nor hid[^h5641] sorrow[^h5999] from mine eyes[^h5869].
###### 11
Why died[^h4191] I not from the womb[^h7358]? why did I not give up the ghost[^h1478] when I came out[^h3318] of the belly[^h990]?
###### 12
Why did the knees[^h1290] prevent[^h6923] me? or why the breasts[^h7699] that I should suck[^h3243]?
###### 13
For now should I have lain still[^h7901] and been quiet[^h8252], I should have slept[^h3462]: then had I been at rest[^h5117],
###### 14
With kings[^h4428] and counsellors[^h3289] of the earth[^h776], which built[^h1129] desolate places[^h2723] for themselves;
###### 15
Or with princes[^h8269] that had gold[^h2091], who filled[^h4390] their houses[^h1004] with silver[^h3701]:
###### 16
Or as an hidden[^h2934] untimely birth[^h5309] I had not been; as infants[^h5768] which never saw[^h7200] light[^h216].
###### 17
There the wicked[^h7563] cease[^h2308] from troubling[^h7267]; and there the weary[^h3019] [^h3581] be at rest[^h5117]. 
###### 18
There the prisoners[^h615] rest[^h7599] together[^h3162]; they hear[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the oppressor[^h5065].
###### 19
The small[^h6996] and great[^h1419] are there; and the servant[^h5650] is free[^h2670] from his master[^h113].
###### 20
Wherefore is light[^h216] given[^h5414] to him that is in misery[^h6001], and life[^h2416] unto the bitter[^h4751] in soul[^h5315];
###### 21
Which long[^h2442] for death[^h4194], but it cometh not; and dig[^h2658] for it more than for hid treasures[^h4301]; 
###### 22
Which rejoice[^h8056] exceedingly[^h1524], and are glad[^h7797], when they can find[^h4672] the grave[^h6913]?
###### 23
Why is light given to a man[^h1397] whose way[^h1870] is hid[^h5641], and whom God[^h433] hath hedged in[^h5526]?
###### 24
For my sighing[^h585] cometh[^h935] before[^h6440] I eat[^h3899], and my roarings[^h7581] are poured out[^h5413] like the waters[^h4325]. 
###### 25
For the thing which I greatly[^h6343] feared[^h6342] is come[^h857] upon me, and that which I was afraid[^h3025] of is come[^h935] unto me. 
###### 26
I was not in safety[^h7951], neither had I rest[^h8252], neither was I quiet[^h5117]; yet trouble[^h7267] came[^h935].

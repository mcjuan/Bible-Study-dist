###### 1
But Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
Hear[^h8085] diligently[^h8085] my speech[^h4405], and let this be your consolations[^h8575].
###### 3
Suffer[^h5375] me that I may speak[^h1696]; and after[^h310] that I have spoken[^h1696], mock on[^h3932].
###### 4
As for me, is my complaint[^h7879] to man[^h120]? and if it were so, why should not my spirit[^h7307] be troubled[^h7114]? 
###### 5
Mark[^h6437] me, and be astonished[^h8074], and lay[^h7760] your hand[^h3027] upon your mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 6
Even when I remember[^h2142] I am afraid[^h926], and trembling[^h6427] taketh hold on[^h270] my flesh[^h1320].
###### 7
Wherefore do the wicked[^h7563] live[^h2421], become old[^h6275], yea, are mighty[^h1396] in power[^h2428]?
###### 8
Their seed[^h2233] is established[^h3559] in their sight[^h6440] with them, and their offspring[^h6631] before their eyes[^h5869].
###### 9
Their houses[^h1004] are safe[^h7965] from fear[^h6343], neither is the rod[^h7626] of God[^h433] upon them. 
###### 10
Their bull[^h7794] gendereth[^h5674], and faileth[^h1602] not; their cow[^h6510] calveth[^h6403], and casteth not her calf[^h7921].
###### 11
They send forth[^h7971] their little ones[^h5759] like a flock[^h6629], and their children[^h3206] dance[^h7540].
###### 12
They take[^h5375] the timbrel[^h8596] and harp[^h3658], and rejoice[^h8055] at the sound[^h6963] of the organ[^h5748].
###### 13
They spend[^h3615] [^h1086] their days[^h3117] in wealth[^h2896], and in a moment[^h7281] go down[^h2865] [^h5181] to the grave[^h7585]. 
###### 14
Therefore they say[^h559] unto God[^h410], Depart[^h5493] from us; for we desire[^h2654] not the knowledge[^h1847] of thy ways[^h1870].
###### 15
What is the Almighty[^h7706], that we should serve[^h5647] him? and what profit[^h3276] should we have, if we pray[^h6293] unto him?
###### 16
Lo, their good[^h2898] is not in their hand[^h3027]: the counsel[^h6098] of the wicked[^h7563] is far[^h7368] from me.
###### 17
How oft is the candle[^h5216] of the wicked[^h7563] put out[^h1846]! and how oft cometh[^h935] their destruction[^h343] upon them! God distributeth[^h2505] sorrows[^h2256] in his anger[^h639]. 
###### 18
They are as stubble[^h8401] before[^h6440] the wind[^h7307], and as chaff[^h4671] that the storm[^h5492] carrieth away[^h1589]. 
###### 19
God[^h433] layeth up[^h6845] his iniquity[^h205] for his children[^h1121]: he rewardeth[^h7999] him, and he shall know[^h3045] it. 
###### 20
His eyes[^h5869] shall see[^h7200] his destruction[^h3589], and he shall drink[^h8354] of the wrath[^h2534] of the Almighty[^h7706].
###### 21
For what pleasure[^h2656] hath he in his house[^h1004] after[^h310] him, when the number[^h4557] of his months[^h2320] is cut off in the midst[^h2686]?
###### 22
Shall any teach[^h3925] God[^h410] knowledge[^h1847]? seeing he judgeth[^h8199] those that are high[^h7311].
###### 23
One dieth[^h4191] in his full[^h8537] strength[^h6106], being wholly at ease[^h7946] and quiet[^h7961]. 
###### 24
His breasts[^h5845] are full[^h4390] of milk[^h2461], and his bones[^h6106] are moistened[^h8248] with marrow[^h4221]. 
###### 25
And another dieth[^h4191] in the bitterness[^h4751] of his soul[^h5315], and never eateth[^h398] with pleasure[^h2896].
###### 26
They shall lie down[^h7901] alike[^h3162] in the dust[^h6083], and the worms[^h7415] shall cover[^h3680] them.
###### 27
Behold, I know[^h3045] your thoughts[^h4284], and the devices[^h4209] which ye wrongfully imagine[^h2554] against me.
###### 28
For ye say[^h559], Where is the house[^h1004] of the prince[^h5081]? and where are the dwelling[^h4908] places[^h168] of the wicked[^h7563]? 
###### 29
Have ye not asked[^h7592] them that go[^h5674] by the way[^h1870]? and do ye not know[^h5234] their tokens[^h226],
###### 30
That the wicked[^h7451] is reserved[^h2820] to the day[^h3117] of destruction[^h343]? they shall be brought forth[^h2986] to the day[^h3117] of wrath[^h5678]. 
###### 31
Who shall declare[^h5046] his way[^h1870] to his face[^h6440]? and who shall repay[^h7999] him what he hath done[^h6213]?
###### 32
Yet shall he be brought[^h2986] to the grave[^h6913], and shall remain[^h8245] in the tomb[^h1430].  
###### 33
The clods[^h7263] of the valley[^h5158] shall be sweet[^h4985] unto him, and every man[^h120] shall draw[^h4900] after[^h310] him, as there are innumerable[^h4557] before[^h6440] him.
###### 34
How then comfort[^h5162] ye me in vain[^h1892], seeing in your answers[^h8666] there remaineth[^h7604] falsehood[^h4604]?

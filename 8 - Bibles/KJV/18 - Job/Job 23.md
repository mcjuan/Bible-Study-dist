###### 1
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
Even to day[^h3117] is my complaint[^h7879] bitter[^h4805]: my stroke[^h3027] is heavier[^h3513] than my groaning[^h585]. 
###### 3
Oh that[^h5414] I knew[^h3045] where I might find[^h4672] him! that I might come[^h935] even to his seat[^h8499]!
###### 4
I would order[^h6186] my cause[^h4941] before[^h6440] him, and fill[^h4390] my mouth[^h6310] with arguments[^h8433].
###### 5
I would know[^h3045] the words[^h4405] which he would answer[^h6030] me, and understand[^h995] what he would say[^h559] unto me.
###### 6
Will he plead[^h7378] against[^h5978] me with his great[^h7230] power[^h3581]? No; but he would put[^h7760] strength in me.
###### 7
There the righteous[^h3477] might dispute[^h3198] with him; so should I be delivered[^h6403] for ever[^h5331] from my judge[^h8199].
###### 8
Behold, I go[^h1980] forward[^h6924], but he is not there; and backward[^h268], but I cannot perceive[^h995] him:
###### 9
On the left hand[^h8040], where he doth work[^h6213], but I cannot behold[^h2372] him: he hideth[^h5848] himself on the right hand[^h3225], that I cannot see[^h7200] him:
###### 10
But he knoweth[^h3045] the way[^h1870] that I take[^h5978]: when he hath tried[^h974] me, I shall come forth[^h3318] as gold[^h2091]. 
###### 11
My foot[^h7272] hath held[^h270] his steps[^h838], his way[^h1870] have I kept[^h8104], and not declined[^h5186].
###### 12
Neither have I gone back[^h4185] from the commandment[^h4687] of his lips[^h8193]; I have esteemed[^h6845] the words[^h561] of his mouth[^h6310] more than my necessary[^h2706] food.  
###### 13
But he is in one[^h259] mind, and who can turn[^h7725] him? and what his soul[^h5315] desireth[^h183], even that he doeth[^h6213].
###### 14
For he performeth[^h7999] the thing that is appointed[^h2706] for me: and many[^h7227] such[^h2007] things are with him.
###### 15
Therefore am I troubled[^h926] at his presence[^h6440]: when I consider[^h995], I am afraid[^h6342] of him.
###### 16
For God[^h410] maketh my heart[^h3820] soft[^h7401], and the Almighty[^h7706] troubleth[^h926] me:
###### 17
Because I was not cut off[^h6789] before[^h6440] the darkness[^h2822], neither hath he covered[^h3680] the darkness[^h652] from my face[^h6440].

###### 1
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559],
###### 2
I know[^h3045] that thou canst do[^h3201] every thing, and that no thought[^h4209] can be withholden[^h1219] from thee. 
###### 3
Who is he that hideth[^h5956] counsel[^h6098] without knowledge[^h1847]? therefore have I uttered[^h5046] that I understood[^h995] not; things too wonderful[^h6381] for me, which I knew[^h3045] not.
###### 4
Hear[^h8085], I beseech thee, and I will speak[^h1696]: I will demand[^h7592] of thee, and declare[^h3045] thou unto me.
###### 5
I have heard[^h8085] of thee by the hearing[^h8088] of the ear[^h241]: but now mine eye[^h5869] seeth[^h7200] thee.
###### 6
Wherefore I abhor[^h3988] myself, and repent[^h5162] in dust[^h6083] and ashes[^h665].
###### 7
And it was so, that after[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] these words[^h1697] unto Job[^h347], the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to Eliphaz[^h464] the Temanite[^h8489], My wrath[^h639] is kindled[^h2734] against thee, and against thy two[^h8147] friends[^h7453]: for ye have not spoken[^h1696] of me the thing that is right[^h3559], as my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347] hath.
###### 8
Therefore take[^h3947] unto you now seven[^h7651] bullocks[^h6499] and seven[^h7651] rams[^h352], and go[^h3212] to my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347], and offer up[^h5927] for yourselves a burnt offering[^h5930]; and my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347] shall pray[^h6419] for you: for him[^h6440] will I accept[^h5375]: lest I deal[^h6213] with you after your folly[^h5039], in that ye have not spoken[^h1696] of me the thing which is right[^h3559], like my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347]. 
###### 9
So Eliphaz[^h464] the Temanite[^h8489] and Bildad[^h1085] the Shuhite[^h7747] and Zophar[^h6691] the Naamathite[^h5284] went[^h3212], and did[^h6213] according as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h1696] them: the LORD[^h3068] also accepted[^h5375] Job[^h6440] [^h347]. 
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] turned[^h7725] the captivity[^h7622] [^h7622] of Job[^h347], when he prayed[^h6419] for his friends[^h7453]: also the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h3254] Job[^h347] twice as much[^h4932] as he had before. 
###### 11
Then came[^h935] there unto him all his brethren[^h251], and all his sisters[^h269], and all they that had been of his acquaintance[^h3045] before[^h6440], and did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] with him in his house[^h1004]: and they bemoaned[^h5110] him, and comforted[^h5162] him over all the evil[^h7451] that the LORD[^h3068] had brought[^h935] upon him: every man[^h376] also gave[^h5414] him a[^h259] piece of money[^h7192], and every one[^h376] an earring[^h5141] of gold[^h2091].
###### 12
So the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] the latter end[^h319] of Job[^h347] more than his beginning[^h7225]: for he had fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629], and six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] camels[^h1581], and a thousand[^h505] yoke[^h6776] of oxen[^h1241], and a thousand[^h505] she asses[^h860].
###### 13
He had also seven[^h7658] sons[^h1121] and three[^h7969] daughters[^h1323].
###### 14
And he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the first[^h259], Jemima[^h3224]; and the name[^h8034] of the second[^h8145], Kezia[^h7103]; and the name[^h8034] of the third[^h7992], Kerenhappuch[^h7163].
###### 15
And in all the land[^h776] were no women[^h802] found[^h4672] so fair[^h3303] as the daughters[^h1323] of Job[^h347]: and their father[^h1] gave[^h5414] them inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] their brethren[^h251].
###### 16
After[^h310] this lived[^h2421] Job[^h347] an hundred[^h3967] and forty[^h705] years[^h8141], and saw[^h7200] his sons[^h1121], and his sons'[^h1121] sons[^h1121], even four[^h702] generations[^h1755].
###### 17
So Job[^h347] died[^h4191], being old[^h2205] and full[^h7649] of days[^h3117].

###### 1
Then answered[^h6030] Bildad[^h1085] the Shuhite[^h7747], and said[^h559],
###### 2
How long[^h5704] will it be ere ye make[^h7760] an end[^h7078] of words[^h4405]? mark[^h995], and afterwards[^h310] we will speak[^h1696].
###### 3
Wherefore are we counted[^h2803] as beasts[^h929], and reputed vile[^h2933] in your sight[^h5869]?
###### 4
He teareth[^h2963] himself[^h5315] in his anger[^h639]: shall the earth[^h776] be forsaken[^h5800] for thee? and shall the rock[^h6697] be removed[^h6275] out of his place[^h4725]? 
###### 5
Yea, the light[^h216] of the wicked[^h7563] shall be put out[^h1846], and the spark[^h7632] of his fire[^h784] shall not shine[^h5050].
###### 6
The light[^h216] shall be dark[^h2821] in his tabernacle[^h168], and his candle[^h5216] shall be put out[^h1846] with him. 
###### 7
The steps[^h6806] of his strength[^h202] shall be straitened[^h3334], and his own counsel[^h6098] shall cast him down[^h7993].
###### 8
For he is cast[^h7971] into a net[^h7568] by his own feet[^h7272], and he walketh[^h1980] upon a snare[^h7639].
###### 9
The gin[^h6341] shall take[^h270] him by the heel[^h6119], and the robber[^h6782] shall prevail[^h2388] against him.
###### 10
The snare[^h2256] is laid[^h2934] for him in the ground[^h776], and a trap[^h4434] for him in the way[^h5410]. 
###### 11
Terrors[^h1091] shall make him afraid[^h1204] on every side[^h5439], and shall drive[^h6327] him to his feet[^h7272]. 
###### 12
His strength[^h202] shall be hungerbitten[^h7457], and destruction[^h343] shall be ready[^h3559] at his side[^h6763].
###### 13
It shall devour[^h398] the strength[^h905] of his skin[^h5785]: even the firstborn[^h1060] of death[^h4194] shall devour[^h398] his strength[^h905]. 
###### 14
His confidence[^h4009] shall be rooted out[^h5423] of his tabernacle[^h168], and it shall bring[^h6805] him to the king[^h4428] of terrors[^h1091].
###### 15
It shall dwell[^h7931] in his tabernacle[^h168], because it is none[^h1097] of his: brimstone[^h1614] shall be scattered[^h2219] upon his habitation[^h5116].
###### 16
His roots[^h8328] shall be dried up[^h3001] beneath, and above[^h4605] shall his branch[^h7105] be cut off[^h5243].
###### 17
His remembrance[^h2143] shall perish[^h6] from the earth[^h776], and he shall have no name[^h8034] in the street[^h6440] [^h2351].
###### 18
He shall be driven[^h1920] from light[^h216] into darkness[^h2822], and chased[^h5074] out of the world[^h8398]. 
###### 19
He shall neither have son[^h5209] nor nephew[^h5220] among his people[^h5971], nor any remaining[^h8300] in his dwellings[^h4033].
###### 20
They that come after[^h314] him shall be astonied[^h8074] at his day[^h3117], as they that went before[^h6931] were affrighted[^h270] [^h8178].  
###### 21
Surely such are the dwellings[^h4908] of the wicked[^h5767], and this is the place[^h4725] of him that knoweth[^h3045] not God[^h410].

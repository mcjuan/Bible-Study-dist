###### 1
My breath[^h7307] is corrupt[^h2254], my days[^h3117] are extinct[^h2193], the graves[^h6913] are ready for me. 
###### 2
Are there not mockers[^h2049] with me? and doth not mine eye[^h5869] continue[^h3885] in their provocation[^h4784]? 
###### 3
Lay down[^h7760] now, put me in a surety[^h6148] with thee; who is he that will strike[^h8628] hands[^h3027] with me?
###### 4
For thou hast hid[^h6845] their heart[^h3820] from understanding[^h7922]: therefore shalt thou not exalt[^h7311] them.
###### 5
He that speaketh[^h5046] flattery[^h2506] to his friends[^h7453], even the eyes[^h5869] of his children[^h1121] shall fail[^h3615].
###### 6
He hath made[^h3322] me also a byword[^h4914] of the people[^h5971]; and aforetime[^h6440] I was as a tabret[^h8611]. 
###### 7
Mine eye[^h5869] also is dim[^h3543] by reason of sorrow[^h3708], and all my members[^h3338] are as a shadow[^h6738]. 
###### 8
Upright[^h3477] men shall be astonied[^h8074] at this, and the innocent[^h5355] shall stir up[^h5782] himself against the hypocrite[^h2611].
###### 9
The righteous[^h6662] also shall hold[^h270] on his way[^h1870], and he that hath clean[^h2890] hands[^h3027] shall be[^h3254] stronger and stronger[^h555]. 
###### 10
But[^h199] as for you all, do ye return[^h7725], and come now[^h935]: for I cannot find[^h4672] one wise[^h2450] man among you.
###### 11
My days[^h3117] are past[^h5674], my purposes[^h2154] are broken off[^h5423], even the thoughts[^h4180] of my heart[^h3824]. 
###### 12
They change[^h7760] the night[^h3915] into day[^h3117]: the light[^h216] is short[^h7138] because[^h6440] of darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 13
If I wait[^h6960], the grave[^h7585] is mine house[^h1004]: I have made[^h7502] my bed[^h3326] in the darkness[^h2822].
###### 14
I have said[^h7121] to corruption[^h7845], Thou art my father[^h1]: to the worm[^h7415], Thou art my mother[^h517], and my sister[^h269]. 
###### 15
And where is now[^h645] my hope[^h8615]? as for my hope[^h8615], who shall see[^h7789] it?
###### 16
They shall go down[^h3381] to the bars[^h905] of the pit[^h7585], when our rest[^h5183] together[^h3162] is in the dust[^h6083].

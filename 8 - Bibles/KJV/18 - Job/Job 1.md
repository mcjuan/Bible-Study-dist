###### 1
There was a man[^h376] in the land[^h776] of Uz[^h5780], whose name[^h8034] was Job[^h347]; and that man[^h376] was perfect[^h8535] and upright[^h3477], and one that feared[^h3373] God[^h430], and eschewed[^h5493] evil[^h7451].
###### 2
And there were born[^h3205] unto him seven[^h7651] sons[^h1121] and three[^h7969] daughters[^h1323].
###### 3
His substance[^h4735] also was seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629], and three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] camels[^h1581], and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] yoke[^h6776] of oxen[^h1241], and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] she asses[^h860], and a very[^h3966] great[^h7227] household[^h5657]; so that this man[^h376] was the greatest[^h1419] of all the men[^h1121] of the east[^h6924].   
###### 4
And his sons[^h1121] went[^h1980] and feasted[^h4960] [^h6213] in their houses[^h1004], every one[^h376] his day[^h3117]; and sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] for their three[^h7969] sisters[^h269] to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354] with them.
###### 5
And it was so, when the days[^h3117] of their feasting[^h4960] were gone about[^h5362], that Job[^h347] sent[^h7971] and sanctified[^h6942] them, and rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] according to the number[^h4557] of them all: for Job[^h347] said[^h559], It may be[^h194] that my sons[^h1121] have sinned[^h2398], and cursed[^h1288] God[^h430] in their hearts[^h3824]. Thus did[^h6213] Job[^h347] continually[^h3117]. 
###### 6
Now there was a day[^h3117] when the sons[^h1121] of God[^h430] came[^h935] to present[^h3320] themselves before the LORD[^h3068], and Satan[^h7854] came[^h935] also among[^h8432] them.  
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], Whence[^h370] comest[^h935] thou? Then Satan[^h7854] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], From going to and fro[^h7751] in the earth[^h776], and from walking up and down[^h1980] in it.
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], Hast thou considered[^h7760] [^h3820] my servant[^h5650] Job[^h347], that there is none like him in the earth[^h776], a perfect[^h8535] and an upright[^h3477] man[^h376], one that feareth[^h3373] God[^h430], and escheweth[^h5493] evil[^h7451]? 
###### 9
Then Satan[^h7854] answered[^h6030] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Doth Job[^h347] fear[^h3372] God[^h430] for nought[^h2600]?
###### 10
Hast not thou made an hedge[^h7753] about him, and about[^h1157] his house[^h1004], and about all that he hath on every side[^h5439]? thou hast blessed[^h1288] the work[^h4639] of his hands[^h3027], and his substance[^h4735] is increased[^h6555] in the land[^h776]. 
###### 11
But[^h199] put forth[^h7971] thine hand[^h3027] now, and touch[^h5060] all that he hath, and he will curse[^h1288] [^h3808] thee to thy face[^h6440]. 
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Satan[^h7854], Behold, all that he hath is in thy power[^h3027]; only upon himself put not forth[^h7971] thine hand[^h3027]. So Satan[^h7854] went forth[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 13
And there was a day[^h3117] when his sons[^h1121] and his daughters[^h1323] were eating[^h398] and drinking[^h8354] wine[^h3196] in their eldest[^h1060] brother's[^h251] house[^h1004]:
###### 14
And there came[^h935] a messenger[^h4397] unto Job[^h347], and said[^h559], The oxen[^h1241] were plowing[^h2790], and the asses[^h860] feeding[^h7462] beside[^h3027] them:
###### 15
And the Sabeans[^h7614] fell[^h5307] upon them, and took them away[^h3947]; yea, they have slain[^h5221] the servants[^h5288] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; and I only am escaped[^h4422] alone to tell[^h5046] thee.
###### 16
While he was yet speaking[^h1696], there came[^h935] also another, and said[^h559], The fire[^h784] of God[^h430] is fallen[^h5307] from heaven[^h8064], and hath burned up[^h1197] the sheep[^h6629], and the servants[^h5288], and consumed[^h398] them; and I only am escaped[^h4422] alone to tell[^h5046] thee. 
###### 17
While he was yet speaking[^h1696], there came[^h935] also another, and said[^h559], The Chaldeans[^h3778] made out[^h7760] three[^h7969] bands[^h7218], and fell[^h6584] upon the camels[^h1581], and have carried them away[^h3947], yea, and slain[^h5221] the servants[^h5288] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; and I only am escaped[^h4422] alone to tell[^h5046] thee. 
###### 18
While he was yet speaking[^h1696], there came[^h935] also another, and said[^h559], Thy sons[^h1121] and thy daughters[^h1323] were eating[^h398] and drinking[^h8354] wine[^h3196] in their eldest[^h1060] brother's[^h251] house[^h1004]:
###### 19
And, behold, there came[^h935] a great[^h1419] wind[^h7307] from[^h5676] the wilderness[^h4057], and smote[^h5060] the four[^h702] corners[^h6438] of the house[^h1004], and it fell[^h5307] upon the young men[^h5288], and they are dead[^h4191]; and I only am escaped[^h4422] alone to tell[^h5046] thee. 
###### 20
Then Job[^h347] arose[^h6965], and rent[^h7167] his mantle[^h4598], and shaved[^h1494] his head[^h7218], and fell down[^h5307] upon the ground[^h776], and worshipped[^h7812], 
###### 21
And said[^h559], Naked[^h6174] came I out[^h3318] of my mother's[^h517] womb[^h990], and naked[^h6174] shall I return[^h7725] thither: the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414], and the LORD[^h3068] hath taken away[^h3947]; blessed[^h1288] be the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
In all this Job[^h347] sinned[^h2398] not, nor charged[^h5414] God[^h430] foolishly[^h8604].

###### 1
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
I have heard[^h8085] many such things[^h7227]: miserable[^h5999] comforters[^h5162] are ye all. 
###### 3
Shall vain[^h7307] words[^h1697] have an end[^h7093]? or what emboldeneth[^h4834] thee that thou answerest[^h6030]? 
###### 4
I also could speak[^h1696] as ye do: if[^h3863] your soul[^h5315] were[^h3426] in my soul's[^h5315] stead, I could heap up[^h2266] words[^h4405] against you, and shake[^h5128] mine head[^h7218] at[^h1119] you.
###### 5
But I would strengthen[^h553] you with[^h1119] my mouth[^h6310], and the moving[^h5205] of my lips[^h8193] should asswage[^h2820] your grief.
###### 6
Though I speak[^h1696], my grief[^h3511] is not asswaged[^h2820]: and though I forbear[^h2308], what am I eased[^h1980]? 
###### 7
But now he hath made me weary[^h3811]: thou hast made desolate[^h8074] all my company[^h5712].
###### 8
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles[^h7059], which is a witness[^h5707] against me: and my leanness[^h3585] rising up[^h6965] in me beareth witness[^h6030] to my face[^h6440].
###### 9
He teareth[^h2963] me in his wrath[^h639], who hateth[^h7852] me: he gnasheth[^h2786] upon me with his teeth[^h8127]; mine enemy[^h6862] sharpeneth[^h3913] his eyes[^h5869] upon me.
###### 10
They have gaped[^h6473] upon me with their mouth[^h6310]; they have smitten[^h5221] me upon the cheek[^h3895] reproachfully[^h2781]; they have gathered[^h4390] themselves together[^h3162] against me.
###### 11
God[^h410] hath delivered[^h5462] me to the ungodly[^h5760], and turned me over[^h3399] into the hands[^h3027] of the wicked[^h7563]. 
###### 12
I was at ease[^h7961], but he hath broken me asunder[^h6565]: he hath also taken[^h270] me by my neck[^h6203], and shaken me to pieces[^h6327], and set me up[^h6965] for his mark[^h4307].
###### 13
His archers[^h7228] compass me round about[^h5437], he cleaveth[^h6398] my reins[^h3629] asunder[^h6398], and doth not spare[^h2550]; he poureth out[^h8210] my gall[^h4845] upon the ground[^h776].
###### 14
He breaketh[^h6555] me with breach[^h6556] upon[^h6440] breach[^h6556], he runneth[^h7323] upon me like a giant[^h1368].
###### 15
I have sewed[^h8609] sackcloth[^h8242] upon my skin[^h1539], and defiled[^h5953] my horn[^h7161] in the dust[^h6083].
###### 16
My face[^h6440] is foul[^h2560] with weeping[^h1065], and on my eyelids[^h6079] is the shadow of death[^h6757];
###### 17
Not for any injustice[^h2555] in mine hands[^h3709]: also my prayer[^h8605] is pure[^h2134].
###### 18
O earth[^h776], cover[^h3680] not thou my blood[^h1818], and let my cry[^h2201] have no place[^h4725].
###### 19
Also now, behold, my witness[^h5707] is in heaven[^h8064], and my record[^h7717] is on high[^h4791]. 
###### 20
My friends[^h7453] scorn[^h3887] me: but mine eye[^h5869] poureth out[^h1811] tears unto God[^h433]. 
###### 21
O that one might plead[^h3198] for a man[^h1397] with God[^h433], as a man[^h120] pleadeth for his neighbour[^h1121] [^h7453]! 
###### 22
When a few[^h4557] years[^h8141] are come[^h857], then I shall go[^h1980] the way[^h734] whence I shall not return[^h7725].

###### 1
So these three[^h7969] men[^h582] ceased[^h7673] to answer[^h6030] Job[^h347], because he was righteous[^h6662] in his own eyes[^h5869]. 
###### 2
Then was kindled[^h2734] the wrath[^h639] of Elihu[^h453] the son[^h1121] of Barachel[^h1292] the Buzite[^h940], of the kindred[^h4940] of Ram[^h7410]: against Job[^h347] was his wrath[^h639] kindled[^h2734], because he justified[^h6663] himself[^h5315] rather than God[^h430]. 
###### 3
Also against his three[^h7969] friends[^h7453] was his wrath[^h639] kindled[^h2734], because they had found[^h4672] no answer[^h4617], and yet had condemned[^h7561] Job[^h347].
###### 4
Now Elihu[^h453] had waited[^h2442] till Job[^h347] had spoken[^h1697], because they were elder[^h2205] [^h3117] than he.  
###### 5
When Elihu[^h453] saw[^h7200] that there was no answer[^h4617] in the mouth[^h6310] of these three[^h7969] men[^h582], then his wrath[^h639] was kindled[^h2734].
###### 6
And Elihu[^h453] the son[^h1121] of Barachel[^h1292] the Buzite[^h940] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], I am young[^h6810] [^h3117], and ye are very old[^h3453]; wherefore I was afraid[^h2119], and durst[^h3372] not shew[^h2331] you mine opinion[^h1843].  
###### 7
I said[^h559], Days[^h3117] should speak[^h1696], and multitude[^h7230] of years[^h8141] should teach[^h3045] wisdom[^h2451].
###### 8
But[^h403] there is a spirit[^h7307] in man[^h582]: and the inspiration[^h5397] of the Almighty[^h7706] giveth them understanding[^h995].
###### 9
Great men[^h7227] are not always wise[^h2449]: neither do the aged[^h2205] understand[^h995] judgment[^h4941].
###### 10
Therefore I said[^h559], Hearken[^h8085] to me; I also will shew[^h2331] mine opinion[^h1843].
###### 11
Behold, I waited[^h3176] for your words[^h1697]; I gave ear[^h238] to your reasons[^h8394], whilst ye searched out[^h2713] what to say[^h4405].  
###### 12
Yea, I attended[^h995] unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced[^h3198] Job[^h347], or that answered[^h6030] his words[^h561]:
###### 13
Lest ye should say[^h559], We have found out[^h4672] wisdom[^h2451]: God[^h410] thrusteth him down[^h5086], not man[^h376].
###### 14
Now he hath not directed[^h6186] his words[^h4405] against me: neither will I answer[^h7725] him with your speeches[^h561]. 
###### 15
They were amazed[^h2865], they answered[^h6030] no more: they left off[^h6275] speaking[^h4405]. 
###### 16
When I had waited[^h3176], (for they spake[^h1696] not, but stood still[^h5975], and answered[^h6030] no more;)
###### 17
I said, I will answer[^h6030] also my part[^h2506], I also will shew[^h2331] mine opinion[^h1843].
###### 18
For I am full[^h4390] of matter[^h4405], the spirit[^h7307] within[^h990] me constraineth[^h6693] me.  
###### 19
Behold, my belly[^h990] is as wine[^h3196] which hath no vent[^h6605]; it is ready to burst[^h1234] like new[^h2319] bottles[^h178]. 
###### 20
I will speak[^h1696], that I may be refreshed[^h7304]: I will open[^h6605] my lips[^h8193] and answer[^h6030]. 
###### 21
Let me not, I pray you, accept[^h5375] any man's[^h376] person[^h6440], neither let me give flattering titles[^h3655] unto man[^h120].
###### 22
For I know[^h3045] not to give flattering titles[^h3655]; in so doing my maker[^h6213] would soon[^h4592] take me away[^h5375].

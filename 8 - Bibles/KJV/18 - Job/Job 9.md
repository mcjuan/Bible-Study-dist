###### 1
Then Job[^h347] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559],
###### 2
I know[^h3045] it is so of a truth[^h551]: but how should man[^h582] be just[^h6663] with God[^h410]? 
###### 3
If he will[^h2654] contend[^h7378] with him, he cannot answer[^h6030] him one[^h259] of a thousand[^h505].
###### 4
He is wise[^h2450] in heart[^h3824], and mighty[^h533] in strength[^h3581]: who hath hardened[^h7185] himself against him, and hath prospered[^h7999]?
###### 5
Which removeth[^h6275] the mountains[^h2022], and they know[^h3045] not: which overturneth[^h2015] them in his anger[^h639].
###### 6
Which shaketh[^h7264] the earth[^h776] out of her place[^h4725], and the pillars[^h5982] thereof tremble[^h6426].
###### 7
Which commandeth[^h559] the sun[^h2775], and it riseth[^h2224] not; and sealeth up[^h2856] the stars[^h3556].
###### 8
Which alone spreadeth out[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064], and treadeth[^h1869] upon the waves[^h1116] of the sea[^h3220]. 
###### 9
Which maketh[^h6213] Arcturus[^h5906], Orion[^h3685], and Pleiades[^h3598], and the chambers[^h2315] of the south[^h8486]. 
###### 10
Which doeth[^h6213] great things[^h1419] past[^h369] finding out[^h2714]; yea, and wonders[^h6381] without number[^h4557].
###### 11
Lo, he goeth[^h5674] by me, and I see[^h7200] him not: he passeth on[^h2498] also, but I perceive[^h995] him not.
###### 12
Behold, he taketh away[^h2862], who can hinder[^h7725] him? who will say[^h559] unto him, What doest[^h6213] thou? 
###### 13
If God[^h433] will not withdraw[^h7725] his anger[^h639], the proud[^h7293] helpers[^h5826] do stoop[^h7817] under him. 
###### 14
How much less shall I answer[^h6030] him, and choose out[^h977] my words[^h1697] to reason with him?
###### 15
Whom, though I were righteous[^h6663], yet would I not answer[^h6030], but I would make supplication[^h2603] to my judge[^h8199].
###### 16
If I had called[^h7121], and he had answered[^h6030] me; yet would I not believe[^h539] that he had hearkened[^h238] unto my voice[^h6963].
###### 17
For he breaketh[^h7779] me with a tempest[^h8183], and multiplieth[^h7235] my wounds[^h6482] without cause[^h2600].
###### 18
He will not suffer[^h5414] me to take[^h7725] my breath[^h7307], but filleth[^h7646] me with bitterness[^h4472].
###### 19
If I speak of strength[^h3581], lo, he is strong[^h533]: and if of judgment[^h4941], who shall set[^h3259] me a time to plead?
###### 20
If I justify[^h6663] myself, mine own mouth[^h6310] shall condemn[^h7561] me: if I say, I am perfect[^h8535], it shall also prove me perverse[^h6140].
###### 21
Though I were perfect[^h8535], yet would I not know[^h3045] my soul[^h5315]: I would despise[^h3988] my life[^h2416].
###### 22
This is one[^h259] thing, therefore I said[^h559] it, He destroyeth[^h3615] the perfect[^h8535] and the wicked[^h7563].
###### 23
If the scourge[^h7752] slay[^h4191] suddenly[^h6597], he will laugh[^h3932] at the trial[^h4531] of the innocent[^h5355].
###### 24
The earth[^h776] is given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the wicked[^h7563]: he covereth[^h3680] the faces[^h6440] of the judges[^h8199] thereof; if not, where[^h645], and who is he?
###### 25
Now my days[^h3117] are swifter[^h7043] than a post[^h7323]: they flee away[^h1272], they see[^h7200] no good[^h2896].
###### 26
They are passed away[^h2498] as[^h5973] the swift[^h16] ships[^h591]: as the eagle[^h5404] that hasteth[^h2907] to the prey[^h400]. 
###### 27
If I say[^h559], I will forget[^h7911] my complaint[^h7879], I will leave off[^h5800] my heaviness[^h6440], and comfort[^h1082] myself:
###### 28
I am afraid[^h3025] of all my sorrows[^h6094], I know[^h3045] that thou wilt not hold me innocent[^h5352].
###### 29
If I be wicked[^h7561], why then labour[^h3021] I in vain[^h1892]?
###### 30
If I wash[^h7364] myself with[^h7950] snow water[^h4325] [^h1119], and make my hands[^h3709] never[^h1252] [^h1253] so clean[^h2141];
###### 31
Yet[^h227] shalt thou plunge[^h2881] me in the ditch[^h7845], and mine own clothes[^h8008] shall abhor[^h8581] me. 
###### 32
For he is not a man[^h376], as I am, that I should answer[^h6030] him, and we should come[^h935] together[^h3162] in judgment[^h4941].
###### 33
Neither is[^h3426] there any daysman[^h3198] betwixt us, that might lay[^h7896] his hand[^h3027] upon us both[^h8147].  
###### 34
Let him take[^h5493] his rod[^h7626] away[^h5493] from me, and let not his fear[^h367] terrify[^h1204] me:
###### 35
Then would I speak[^h1696], and not fear[^h3372] him; but it is not so with me.

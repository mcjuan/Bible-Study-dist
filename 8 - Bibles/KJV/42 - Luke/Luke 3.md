Now[^g1161] in[^g1722] the fifteenth[^g4003] year[^g2094] of the reign[^g2231] of Tiberius[^g5086] Caesar[^g2541], Pontius[^g4194] Pilate[^g4091] being governor[^g2230] of Judaea[^g2449], and[^g2532] Herod[^g2264] being tetrarch[^g5075] of Galilee[^g1056], and[^g1161] his[^g846] brother[^g80] Philip[^g5376] tetrarch[^g5075] of Ituraea[^g2484] and[^g2532] of the region[^g5561] of Trachonitis[^g5139], and[^g2532] Lysanias[^g3078] the tetrarch[^g5075] of Abilene[^g9], 
###### 2
Annas[^g452] and[^g2532] Caiaphas[^g2533] being[^g1909] the high priests[^g749], the word[^g4487] of God[^g2316] came[^g1096] unto[^g1909] John[^g2491] the son[^g5207] of Zacharias[^g2197] in[^g1722] the wilderness[^g2048].
###### 3
And[^g2532] he came[^g2064] into[^g1519] all[^g3956] the country about[^g4066] Jordan[^g2446], preaching[^g2784] the baptism[^g908] of repentance[^g3341] for[^g1519] the remission[^g859] of sins[^g266];
###### 4
As[^g5613] it is written[^g1125] in[^g1722] the book[^g976] of the words[^g3056] of Esaias[^g2268] the prophet[^g4396], saying[^g3004], The voice[^g5456] of one crying[^g994] in[^g1722] the wilderness[^g2048], Prepare ye[^g2090] the way[^g3598] of the Lord[^g2962], make[^g4160] his[^g846] paths[^g5147] straight[^g2117].
###### 5
Every[^g3956] valley[^g5327] shall be[^g2071] filled[^g4137], and[^g2532] every[^g3956] mountain[^g3735] and[^g2532] hill[^g1015] shall be brought low[^g5013]; and[^g2532] the crooked[^g4646] shall be made[^g1519] straight[^g2117], and[^g2532] the rough[^g5138] ways[^g3598] shall be made[^g1519] smooth[^g3006];
###### 6
And[^g2532] all[^g3956] flesh[^g4561] shall see[^g3700] the salvation[^g4992] of God[^g2316].
###### 7
Then[^g3767] said[^g3004] he to the multitude[^g3793] that came forth[^g1607] to be baptized[^g907] of[^g5259] him[^g846], O generation[^g1081] of vipers[^g2191], who[^g5101] hath warned[^g5263] you[^g5213] to flee[^g5343] from[^g575] the wrath[^g3709] to come[^g3195]?
###### 8
Bring forth[^g4160] therefore[^g3767] fruits[^g2590] worthy[^g514] of repentance[^g3341], and[^g2532] begin[^g756] not[^g3361] to say[^g3004] within[^g1722] yourselves[^g1438], We have[^g2192] Abraham[^g11] to our father[^g3962]: for[^g1063] I say[^g3004] unto you[^g5213], That[^g3754] God[^g2316] is able[^g1410] of[^g1537] these[^g5130] stones[^g3037] to raise up[^g1453] children[^g5043] unto Abraham[^g11]. 
###### 9
And[^g1161] now[^g2235] also[^g2532] the axe[^g513] is laid[^g2749] unto[^g4314] the root[^g4491] of the trees[^g1186]: every[^g3956] tree[^g1186] therefore[^g3767] which bringeth[^g4160] not[^g3361] forth[^g4160] good[^g2570] fruit[^g2590] is hewn down[^g1581], and[^g2532] cast[^g906] into[^g1519] the fire[^g4442].
###### 10
And[^g2532] the people[^g3793] asked[^g1905] him[^g846], saying[^g3004], What[^g5101] shall we do[^g4160] then[^g3767]?
###### 11
He answereth[^g611] and[^g1161] saith[^g3004] unto them[^g846], He that hath[^g2192] two[^g1417] coats[^g5509], let him impart[^g3330] to him that hath[^g2192] none[^g3361]; and[^g2532] he that hath[^g2192] meat[^g1033], let him do[^g4160] likewise[^g3668].
###### 12
Then[^g1161] came[^g2064] also[^g2532] publicans[^g5057] to be baptized[^g907], and[^g2532] said[^g2036] unto[^g4314] him[^g846], Master[^g1320], what[^g5101] shall we do[^g4160]?
###### 13
And[^g1161] he said[^g2036] unto[^g4314] them[^g846], Exact[^g4238] no[^g3367] more[^g4119] than[^g3844] that which is appointed[^g1299] you[^g5213].
###### 14
And[^g1161] the soldiers[^g4754] likewise[^g2532] demanded[^g1905] of him[^g846], saying[^g3004], And[^g2532] what[^g5101] shall we[^g2249] do[^g4160]? And[^g2532] he said[^g2036] unto[^g4314] them[^g846], Do violence[^g1286] to no man[^g3367], neither[^g3366] accuse any falsely[^g4811]; and[^g2532] be content[^g714] with your[^g5216] wages[^g3800].  
###### 15
And[^g1161] as the people[^g2992] were in expectation[^g4328], and[^g2532] all men[^g3956] mused[^g1260] in[^g1722] their[^g846] hearts[^g2588] of[^g4012] John[^g2491], whether[^g3379] he[^g846] were[^g1498] the Christ[^g5547], or not[^g3379];  
###### 16
John[^g2491] answered[^g611], saying[^g3004] unto them all[^g537], I[^g1473] indeed[^g3303] baptize[^g907] you[^g5209] with water[^g5204]; but[^g1161] one mightier than[^g2478] I[^g3450] cometh[^g2064], the latchet[^g2438] of whose[^g3739] [^g846] shoes[^g5266] I am[^g1510] not[^g3756] worthy[^g2425] to unloose[^g3089]: he[^g846] shall baptize[^g907] you[^g5209] with[^g1722] the Holy[^g40] Ghost[^g4151] and[^g2532] with fire[^g4442]:
###### 17
Whose[^g3739] fan[^g4425] is in[^g1722] his[^g846] hand[^g5495], and[^g2532] he will throughly purge[^g1245] his[^g846] floor[^g257], and[^g2532] will gather[^g4863] the wheat[^g4621] into[^g1519] his[^g846] garner[^g596]; but[^g1161] the chaff[^g892] he will burn[^g2618] with fire[^g4442] unquenchable[^g762].
###### 18
And[^g2532] [^g3767] many[^g4183] other[^g2087] things[^g4183] [^g3303] in his exhortation[^g3870] preached[^g2097] he unto the people[^g2992].
###### 19
But[^g1161] Herod[^g2264] the tetrarch[^g5076], being reproved[^g1651] by[^g5259] him[^g846] for[^g4012] Herodias[^g2266] his[^g846] brother[^g80] Philip's[^g5376] wife[^g1135], and[^g2532] for[^g4012] all[^g3956] the evils[^g4190] which[^g3739] Herod[^g2264] had done[^g4160],
###### 20
Added[^g4369] yet[^g2532] this[^g5124] above[^g1909] all[^g3956], that[^g2532] he shut up[^g2623] John[^g2491] in[^g1722] prison[^g5438].
###### 21
Now[^g1161] when all[^g537] the people[^g2992] were baptized[^g1722] [^g907], it came to pass[^g1096], that Jesus[^g2424] also[^g2532] being baptized[^g907], and[^g2532] praying[^g4336], the heaven[^g3772] was opened[^g455],
###### 22
And[^g2532] the Holy[^g40] Ghost[^g4151] descended[^g2597] in a bodily[^g4984] shape[^g1491] like[^g5616] a dove[^g4058] upon[^g1909] him[^g846], and[^g2532] a voice[^g5456] came[^g1096] from[^g1537] heaven[^g3772], which said[^g3004], Thou[^g4771] art[^g1488] my[^g3450] beloved[^g27] Son[^g5207]; in[^g1722] thee[^g4671] I am well pleased[^g2106].
###### 23
And[^g2532] Jesus[^g2424] himself[^g846] began[^g756] to be[^g2258] about[^g5616] thirty[^g5144] years of age[^g2094], being[^g5607] (as[^g5613] was supposed[^g3543]) the son[^g5207] of Joseph[^g2501], which was the son of Heli[^g2242],

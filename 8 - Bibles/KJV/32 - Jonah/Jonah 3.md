###### 1
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto Jonah[^h3124] the second[^h8145] time, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Arise[^h6965], go[^h3212] unto Nineveh[^h5210], that great[^h1419] city[^h5892], and preach[^h7121] unto it the preaching[^h7150] that I bid[^h1696] thee.
###### 3
So Jonah[^h3124] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] unto Nineveh[^h5210], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]. Now Nineveh[^h5210] was an exceeding[^h430] great[^h1419] city[^h5892] of three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h4109]. 
###### 4
And Jonah[^h3124] began[^h2490] to enter[^h935] into the city[^h5892] a[^h259] day's[^h3117] journey[^h4109], and he cried[^h7121], and said[^h559], Yet forty[^h705] days[^h3117], and Nineveh[^h5210] shall be overthrown[^h2015].
###### 5
So the people[^h582] of Nineveh[^h5210] believed[^h539] God[^h430], and proclaimed[^h7121] a fast[^h6685], and put[^h3847] on sackcloth[^h8242], from the greatest[^h1419] of them even to the least[^h6996] of them.
###### 6
For word[^h1697] came[^h5060] unto the king[^h4428] of Nineveh[^h5210], and he arose[^h6965] from his throne[^h3678], and he laid[^h5674] his robe[^h155] from him, and covered[^h3680] him with sackcloth[^h8242], and sat[^h3427] in ashes[^h665].
###### 7
And he caused it to be proclaimed[^h2199] and published[^h559] through Nineveh[^h5210] by the decree[^h2940] of the king[^h4428] and his nobles[^h1419], saying[^h559], Let neither man[^h120] nor beast[^h929], herd[^h1241] nor flock[^h6629], taste[^h2938] any thing[^h3972]: let them not feed[^h7462], nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325]:  
###### 8
But let man[^h120] and beast[^h929] be covered[^h3680] with sackcloth[^h8242], and cry[^h7121] mightily[^h2394] unto God[^h430]: yea, let them turn[^h7725] every one[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], and from the violence[^h2555] that is in their hands[^h3709].
###### 9
Who can tell[^h3045] if God[^h430] will turn[^h7725] and repent[^h5162], and turn away[^h7725] from his fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639], that we perish[^h6] not?
###### 10
And God[^h430] saw[^h7200] their works[^h4639], that they turned[^h7725] from their evil[^h7451] way[^h1870]; and God[^h430] repented[^h5162] of the evil[^h7451], that he had said[^h1696] that he would do[^h6213] unto them; and he did[^h6213] it not.

###### 1
Now the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto Jonah[^h3124] the son[^h1121] of Amittai[^h573], saying[^h559], 
###### 2
Arise[^h6965], go[^h3212] to Nineveh[^h5210], that great[^h1419] city[^h5892], and cry[^h7121] against it; for their wickedness[^h7451] is come up[^h5927] before[^h6440] me.
###### 3
But Jonah[^h3124] rose up[^h6965] to flee[^h1272] unto Tarshish[^h8659] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], and went down[^h3381] to Joppa[^h3305]; and he found[^h4672] a ship[^h591] going[^h935] to Tarshish[^h8659]: so he paid[^h5414] the fare[^h7939] thereof, and went down[^h3381] into it, to go[^h935] with them unto Tarshish[^h8659] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
But the LORD[^h3068] sent out[^h2904] a great[^h1419] wind[^h7307] into the sea[^h3220], and there was a mighty[^h1419] tempest[^h5591] in the sea[^h3220], so that the ship[^h591] was like[^h2803] to be broken[^h7665].  
###### 5
Then the mariners[^h4419] were afraid[^h3372], and cried[^h2199] every man[^h376] unto his god[^h430], and cast forth[^h2904] the wares[^h3627] that were in the ship[^h591] into the sea[^h3220], to lighten[^h7043] it of them. But Jonah[^h3124] was gone down[^h3381] into the sides[^h3411] of the ship[^h5600]; and he lay[^h7901], and was fast asleep[^h7290].
###### 6
So the shipmaster[^h7227] [^h2259] came[^h7126] to him, and said[^h559] unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper[^h7290]? arise[^h6965], call[^h7121] upon thy God[^h430], if so be that God[^h430] will think[^h6245] upon us, that we perish[^h6] not.
###### 7
And they said[^h559] every one[^h376] to his fellow[^h7453], Come[^h3212], and let us cast[^h5307] lots[^h1486], that we may know[^h3045] for whose cause[^h7945] this evil[^h7451] is upon us. So they cast[^h5307] lots[^h1486], and the lot[^h1486] fell[^h5307] upon Jonah[^h3124].
###### 8
Then said[^h559] they unto him, Tell[^h5046] us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil[^h7451] is upon us; What is thine occupation[^h4399]? and whence[^h370] comest[^h935] thou? what is thy country[^h776]? and of what people[^h5971] art thou?
###### 9
And he said[^h559] unto them, I am an Hebrew[^h5680]; and I fear[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of heaven[^h8064], which hath made[^h6213] the sea[^h3220] and the dry[^h3004] land. 
###### 10
Then were the men[^h582] exceedingly[^h1419] [^h3374] afraid[^h3372], and said[^h559] unto him, Why hast thou done[^h6213] this? For the men[^h582] knew[^h3045] that he fled[^h1272] from the presence[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], because he had told[^h5046] them. 
###### 11
Then said[^h559] they unto him, What shall we do[^h6213] unto thee, that the sea[^h3220] may be calm[^h8367] unto us? for the sea[^h3220] wrought[^h1980], and was tempestuous[^h5590].  
###### 12
And he said[^h559] unto them, Take me up[^h5375], and cast me forth[^h2904] into the sea[^h3220]; so shall the sea[^h3220] be calm[^h8367] unto you: for I know[^h3045] that for my sake[^h7945] this great[^h1419] tempest[^h5591] is upon you.
###### 13
Nevertheless the men[^h582] rowed hard[^h2864] to bring[^h7725] it to the land[^h3004]; but they could[^h3201] not: for the sea[^h3220] wrought[^h1980], and was tempestuous[^h5590] against them.  
###### 14
Wherefore they cried[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], We beseech thee[^h577], O LORD[^h3068], we beseech thee, let us not perish[^h6] for this man's[^h376] life[^h5315], and lay[^h5414] not upon us innocent[^h5355] [^h5355] blood[^h1818]: for thou, O LORD[^h3068], hast done[^h6213] as it pleased[^h2654] thee.
###### 15
So they took up[^h5375] Jonah[^h3124], and cast him forth[^h2904] into the sea[^h3220]: and the sea[^h3220] ceased[^h5975] from her raging[^h2197]. 
###### 16
Then the men[^h582] feared[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] exceedingly[^h1419] [^h3374], and offered[^h2076] a sacrifice[^h2077] unto the LORD[^h3068], and made[^h5087] vows[^h5088]. 
###### 17
Now the LORD[^h3068] had prepared[^h4487] a great[^h1419] fish[^h1709] to swallow up[^h1104] Jonah[^h3124]. And Jonah[^h3124] was in the belly[^h4578] of the fish[^h1709] three[^h7969] days[^h3117] and three[^h7969] nights[^h3915].

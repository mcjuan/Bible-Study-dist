###### 1
O that[^h5414] thou wert as my brother[^h251], that sucked[^h3243] the breasts[^h7699] of my mother[^h517]! when I should find[^h4672] thee without[^h2351], I would kiss[^h5401] thee; yea, I should not be despised[^h936]. 
###### 2
I would lead[^h5090] thee, and bring[^h935] thee into my mother's[^h517] house[^h1004], who would instruct[^h3925] me: I would cause thee to drink[^h8248] of spiced[^h7544] wine[^h3196] of the juice[^h6071] of my pomegranate[^h7416].
###### 3
His left hand[^h8040] should be under my head[^h7218], and his right hand[^h3225] should embrace[^h2263] me.
###### 4
I charge[^h7650] you, O daughters[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389], that ye stir not up[^h5782], nor awake[^h5782] my love[^h160], until he please[^h2654]. 
###### 5
Who is this that cometh up[^h5927] from the wilderness[^h4057], leaning[^h7514] upon her beloved[^h1730]? I raised[^h5782] thee up under the apple tree[^h8598]: there thy mother[^h517] brought thee forth[^h2254]: there she brought thee forth[^h2254] that bare[^h3205] thee.
###### 6
Set[^h7760] me as a seal[^h2368] upon thine heart[^h3820], as a seal[^h2368] upon thine arm[^h2220]: for love[^h160] is strong[^h5794] as death[^h4194]; jealousy[^h7068] is cruel[^h7186] as the grave[^h7585]: the coals[^h7565] thereof are coals[^h7565] of fire[^h784], which hath a most vehement flame[^h7957]. 
###### 7
Many[^h7227] waters[^h4325] cannot[^h3201] quench[^h3518] love[^h160], neither can the floods[^h5104] drown[^h7857] it: if a man[^h376] would give[^h5414] all the substance[^h1952] of his house[^h1004] for love[^h160], it would utterly[^h936] be contemned[^h936].
###### 8
We have a little[^h6996] sister[^h269], and she hath no breasts[^h7699]: what shall we do[^h6213] for our sister[^h269] in the day[^h3117] when she shall be spoken for[^h1696]?
###### 9
If she be a wall[^h2346], we will build[^h1129] upon her a palace[^h2918] of silver[^h3701]: and if she be a door[^h1817], we will inclose[^h6696] her with boards[^h3871] of cedar[^h730].
###### 10
I am a wall[^h2346], and my breasts[^h7699] like towers[^h4026]: then was I in his eyes[^h5869] as one that found[^h4672] favour[^h7965]. 
###### 11
Solomon[^h8010] had a vineyard[^h3754] at Baalhamon[^h1174]; he let out[^h5414] the vineyard[^h3754] unto keepers[^h5201]; every one[^h376] for the fruit[^h6529] thereof was to bring[^h935] a thousand[^h505] pieces of silver[^h3701].
###### 12
My vineyard[^h3754], which is mine, is before[^h6440] me: thou, O Solomon[^h8010], must have a thousand[^h505], and those that keep[^h5201] the fruit[^h6529] thereof two hundred[^h3967].
###### 13
Thou that dwellest[^h3427] in the gardens[^h1588], the companions[^h2270] hearken[^h7181] to thy voice[^h6963]: cause me to hear[^h8085] it.
###### 14
Make haste[^h1272], my beloved[^h1730], and be thou like[^h1819] to a roe[^h6643] or to a young[^h6082] hart[^h354] upon the mountains[^h2022] of spices[^h1314].

###### 1
I am come[^h935] into my garden[^h1588], my sister[^h269], my spouse[^h3618]: I have gathered[^h717] my myrrh[^h4753] with my spice[^h1313]; I have eaten[^h398] my honeycomb[^h3293] with my honey[^h1706]; I have drunk[^h8354] my wine[^h3196] with my milk[^h2461]: eat[^h398], O friends[^h7453]; drink[^h8354], yea, drink abundantly[^h7937], O beloved[^h1730]. 
###### 2
I sleep[^h3463], but my heart[^h3820] waketh[^h5782]: it is the voice[^h6963] of my beloved[^h1730] that knocketh[^h1849], saying, Open[^h6605] to me, my sister[^h269], my love[^h7474], my dove[^h3123], my undefiled[^h8535]: for my head[^h7218] is filled[^h4390] with dew[^h2919], and my locks[^h6977] with the drops[^h7447] of the night[^h3915].
###### 3
I have put off[^h6584] my coat[^h3801]; how[^h349] shall I put it on[^h3847]? I have washed[^h7364] my feet[^h7272]; how[^h349] shall I defile[^h2936] them?
###### 4
My beloved[^h1730] put in[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] by[^h4480] the hole[^h2356] of the door, and my bowels[^h4578] were moved[^h1993] for him. 
###### 5
I rose up[^h6965] to open[^h6605] to my beloved[^h1730]; and my hands[^h3027] dropped[^h5197] with myrrh[^h4753], and my fingers[^h676] with sweet smelling[^h5674] myrrh[^h4753], upon the handles[^h3709] of the lock[^h4514]. 
###### 6
I opened[^h6605] to my beloved[^h1730]; but my beloved[^h1730] had withdrawn[^h2559] himself, and was gone[^h5674]: my soul[^h5315] failed[^h3318] when he spake[^h1696]: I sought[^h1245] him, but I could not find[^h4672] him; I called[^h7121] him, but he gave me no answer[^h6030].
###### 7
The watchmen[^h8104] that went about[^h5437] the city[^h5892] found[^h4672] me, they smote[^h5221] me, they wounded[^h6481] me; the keepers[^h8104] of the walls[^h2346] took away[^h5375] my veil[^h7289] from me.
###### 8
I charge[^h7650] you, O daughters[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389], if ye find[^h4672] my beloved[^h1730], that ye tell[^h5046] him, that I am sick[^h2470] of love[^h160]. 
###### 9
What is thy beloved[^h1730] more than another beloved[^h1730], O thou fairest[^h3303] among women[^h802]? what is thy beloved[^h1730] more than another beloved[^h1730], that thou[^h3602] dost so charge[^h7650] us?
###### 10
My beloved[^h1730] is white[^h6703] and ruddy[^h122], the chiefest[^h1713] among ten thousand[^h7233]. 
###### 11
His head[^h7218] is as the most[^h3800] fine gold[^h6337], his locks[^h6977] are bushy[^h8534], and black[^h7838] as a raven[^h6158]. 
###### 12
His eyes[^h5869] are as the eyes of doves[^h3123] by the rivers[^h650] of waters[^h4325], washed[^h7364] with milk[^h2461], and fitly set[^h3427] [^h4402]. 
###### 13
His cheeks[^h3895] are as a bed[^h6170] of spices[^h1314], as sweet[^h4840] flowers[^h4026]: his lips[^h8193] like lilies[^h7799], dropping[^h5197] sweet smelling[^h5674] myrrh[^h4753]. 
###### 14
His hands[^h3027] are as gold[^h2091] rings[^h1550] set[^h4390] with the beryl[^h8658]: his belly[^h4578] is as bright[^h6247] ivory[^h8127] overlaid[^h5968] with sapphires[^h5601].
###### 15
His legs[^h7785] are as pillars[^h5982] of marble[^h8336], set[^h3245] upon sockets[^h134] of fine gold[^h6337]: his countenance[^h4758] is as Lebanon[^h3844], excellent[^h977] as the cedars[^h730].
###### 16
His mouth[^h2441] is most sweet[^h4477]: yea, he is altogether lovely[^h4261]. This is my beloved[^h1730], and this is my friend[^h7453], O daughters[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389].

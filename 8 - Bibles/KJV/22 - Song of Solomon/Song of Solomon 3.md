###### 1
By night[^h3915] on my bed[^h4904] I sought[^h1245] him whom my soul[^h5315] loveth[^h157]: I sought[^h1245] him, but I found[^h4672] him not.
###### 2
I will rise[^h6965] now, and go about[^h5437] the city[^h5892] in the streets[^h7784], and in the broad ways[^h7339] I will seek[^h1245] him whom my soul[^h5315] loveth[^h157]: I sought[^h1245] him, but I found[^h4672] him not.
###### 3
The watchmen[^h8104] that go about[^h5437] the city[^h5892] found[^h4672] me: to whom I said, Saw[^h7200] ye him whom my soul[^h5315] loveth[^h157]?
###### 4
It was but a little[^h4592] that I passed[^h5674] from them, but I found[^h4672] him whom my soul[^h5315] loveth[^h157]: I held[^h270] him, and would not let him go[^h7503], until I had brought[^h935] him into my mother's[^h517] house[^h1004], and into the chamber[^h2315] of her that conceived[^h2029] me.
###### 5
I charge[^h7650] you, O ye daughters[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389], by the roes[^h6643], and[^h176] by the hinds[^h355] of the field[^h7704], that ye stir not up[^h5782], nor awake[^h5782] my love[^h160], till he please[^h2654].
###### 6
Who is this that cometh[^h5927] out of the wilderness[^h4057] like pillars[^h8490] of smoke[^h6227], perfumed[^h6999] with myrrh[^h4753] and frankincense[^h3828], with all powders[^h81] of the merchant[^h7402]?
###### 7
Behold his bed[^h4296], which is Solomon's[^h8010]; threescore[^h8346] valiant[^h1368] men are about[^h5439] it, of the valiant[^h1368] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
They all hold[^h270] swords[^h2719], being expert[^h3925] in war[^h4421]: every man[^h376] hath his sword[^h2719] upon his thigh[^h3409] because of fear[^h6343] in the night[^h3915].
###### 9
King[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] himself a chariot[^h668] of the wood[^h6086] of Lebanon[^h3844]. 
###### 10
He made[^h6213] the pillars[^h5982] thereof of silver[^h3701], the bottom[^h7507] thereof of gold[^h2091], the covering[^h4817] of it of purple[^h713], the midst[^h8432] thereof being paved[^h7528] with love[^h160], for the daughters[^h1323] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 11
Go forth[^h3318], O ye daughters[^h1323] of Zion[^h6726], and behold[^h7200] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] with the crown[^h5850] wherewith his mother[^h517] crowned[^h5849] him in the day[^h3117] of his espousals[^h2861], and in the day[^h3117] of the gladness[^h8057] of his heart[^h3820].

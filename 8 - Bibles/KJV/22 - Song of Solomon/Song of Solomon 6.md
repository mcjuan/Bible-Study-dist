###### 1
Whither is thy beloved[^h1730] gone[^h1980], O thou fairest[^h3303] among women[^h802]? whither is thy beloved[^h1730] turned aside[^h6437]? that we may seek[^h1245] him with thee.
###### 2
My beloved[^h1730] is gone down[^h3381] into his garden[^h1588], to the beds[^h6170] of spices[^h1314], to feed[^h7462] in the gardens[^h1588], and to gather[^h3950] lilies[^h7799].
###### 3
I am my beloved's[^h1730], and my beloved[^h1730] is mine: he feedeth[^h7462] among the lilies[^h7799].
###### 4
Thou art beautiful[^h3303], O my love[^h7474], as Tirzah[^h8656], comely[^h5000] as Jerusalem[^h3389], terrible[^h366] as an army with banners[^h1713].
###### 5
Turn away[^h5437] thine eyes[^h5869] from me, for they[^h1992] have overcome[^h7292] me: thy hair[^h8181] is as a flock[^h5739] of goats[^h5795] that appear[^h1570] from Gilead[^h1568]. 
###### 6
Thy teeth[^h8127] are as a flock[^h5739] of sheep[^h7353] which go up[^h5927] from the washing[^h7367], whereof every one beareth twins[^h8382], and there is not one barren[^h7909] among them.
###### 7
As a piece[^h6400] of a pomegranate[^h7416] are thy temples[^h7541] within[^h1157] thy locks[^h6777].
###### 8
There are threescore[^h8346] queens[^h4436], and fourscore[^h8084] concubines[^h6370], and virgins[^h5959] without number[^h4557].
###### 9
My dove[^h3123], my undefiled[^h8535] is but one[^h259]; she is the only one[^h259] of her mother[^h517], she is the choice[^h1249] one of her that bare[^h3205] her. The daughters[^h1323] saw[^h7200] her, and blessed[^h833] her; yea, the queens[^h4436] and the concubines[^h6370], and they praised[^h1984] her.
###### 10
Who is she that looketh forth[^h8259] as the morning[^h7837], fair[^h3303] as the moon[^h3842], clear[^h1249] as the sun[^h2535], and terrible[^h366] as an army with banners[^h1713]?
###### 11
I went down[^h3381] into the garden[^h1594] of nuts[^h93] to see[^h7200] the fruits[^h3] of the valley[^h5158], and to see[^h7200] whether the vine[^h1612] flourished[^h6524], and the pomegranates[^h7416] budded[^h5132].
###### 12
Or ever I was aware[^h3045], my soul[^h5315] made[^h7760] me like the chariots[^h4818] of Amminadib[^h5993].  
###### 13
Return[^h7725], return[^h7725], O Shulamite[^h7759]; return[^h7725], return[^h7725], that we may look[^h2372] upon thee. What will ye see[^h2372] in the Shulamite[^h7759]? As it were the company[^h4246] of two armies[^h4264].

And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye be come[^h935] into the land[^h776] of your habitations[^h4186], which I give[^h5414] unto you,
###### 3
And will make[^h6213] an offering by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068], a burnt offering[^h5930], or a sacrifice[^h2077] in performing[^h6381] a vow[^h5088], or in a freewill offering[^h5071], or in your solemn feasts[^h4150], to make[^h6213] a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068], of the herd[^h1241], or of the flock[^h6629]: 
###### 4
Then shall he that offereth[^h7126] his offering[^h7133] unto the LORD[^h3068] bring[^h7126] a meat offering[^h4503] of a tenth deal[^h6241] of flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with the fourth[^h7243] part of an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081].
###### 5
And the fourth[^h7243] part of an hin[^h1969] of wine[^h3196] for a drink offering[^h5262] shalt thou prepare[^h6213] with the burnt offering[^h5930] or sacrifice[^h2077], for one[^h259] lamb[^h3532].
###### 6
Or for a ram[^h352], thou shalt prepare[^h6213] for a meat offering[^h4503] two[^h8147] tenth deals[^h6241] of flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with the third[^h7992] part of an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081].
###### 7
And for a drink offering[^h5262] thou shalt offer[^h7126] the third[^h7992] part of an hin[^h1969] of wine[^h3196], for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
And when thou preparest[^h6213] a bullock[^h1121] [^h1241] for a burnt offering[^h5930], or for a sacrifice[^h2077] in performing[^h6381] a vow[^h5088], or peace offerings[^h8002] unto the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 9
Then shall he bring[^h7126] with a bullock[^h1241] [^h1121] a meat offering[^h4503] of three[^h7969] tenth deals[^h6241] of flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with half[^h2677] an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081].
###### 10
And thou shalt bring[^h7126] for a drink offering[^h5262] half[^h2677] an hin[^h1969] of wine[^h3196], for an offering made by fire[^h801], of a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
Thus shall it be done[^h6213] for one[^h259] bullock[^h7794], or for one[^h259] ram[^h352], or for a lamb[^h3532] [^h7716], or a kid[^h5795].
###### 12
According to the number[^h4557] that ye shall prepare[^h6213], so[^h3602] shall ye do[^h6213] to every one[^h259] according to their number[^h4557].
###### 13
All that are born of the country[^h249] shall do[^h6213] these things after this manner, in offering[^h7126] an offering made by fire[^h801], of a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
And if a stranger[^h1616] sojourn[^h1481] with you, or whosoever be among[^h8432] you in your generations[^h1755], and will offer[^h6213] an offering made by fire[^h801], of a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068]; as ye do[^h6213], so he shall do[^h6213].
###### 15
One[^h259] ordinance[^h2708] shall be both for you of the congregation[^h6951], and also for the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] with you, an ordinance[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] in your generations[^h1755]: as ye are, so shall the stranger[^h1616] be before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
One[^h259] law[^h8451] and one[^h259] manner[^h4941] shall be for you, and for the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] with you.
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 18
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye come[^h935] into the land[^h776] whither I bring[^h935] you,
###### 19
Then it shall be, that, when ye eat[^h398] of the bread[^h3899] of the land[^h776], ye shall offer up[^h7311] an heave offering[^h8641] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
Ye shall offer up[^h7311] a cake[^h2471] of the first[^h7225] of your dough[^h6182] for an heave offering[^h8641]: as ye do the heave offering[^h8641] of the threshingfloor[^h1637], so shall ye heave[^h7311] it.
###### 21
Of the first[^h7225] of your dough[^h6182] ye shall give[^h5414] unto the LORD[^h3068] an heave offering[^h8641] in your generations[^h1755].
###### 22
And if ye have erred[^h7686], and not observed[^h6213] all these commandments[^h4687], which the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872],
###### 23
Even all that the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680] you by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872], from the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses, and henceforward[^h1973] among your generations[^h1755];
###### 24
Then it shall be, if ought be committed[^h6213] by ignorance[^h7684] without the knowledge[^h5869] of the congregation[^h5712], that all the congregation[^h5712] shall offer[^h6213] one[^h259] young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] for a burnt offering[^h5930], for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068], with his meat offering[^h4503], and his drink offering[^h5262], according to the manner[^h4941], and one[^h259] kid[^h8163] of the goats[^h5795] for a sin offering[^h2403].  
###### 25
And the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] them; for it is ignorance[^h7684]: and they shall bring[^h935] their offering[^h7133], a sacrifice made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068], and their sin offering[^h2403] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], for their ignorance[^h7684]:
###### 26
And it shall be forgiven[^h5545] all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] among[^h8432] them; seeing all the people[^h5971] were in ignorance[^h7684].
###### 27
And if any[^h259] soul[^h5315] sin[^h2398] through ignorance[^h7684], then he shall bring[^h7126] a she goat[^h5795] of the first[^h1323] year[^h8141] for a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 28
And the priest[^h3548] shall make an atonement[^h3722] for the soul[^h5315] that sinneth ignorantly[^h7683], when he sinneth[^h2398] by ignorance[^h7684] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to make an atonement[^h3722] for him; and it shall be forgiven[^h5545] him.
###### 29
Ye shall have one[^h259] law[^h8451] for him that sinneth[^h6213] through ignorance[^h7684], both for him that is born[^h249] among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and for the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] among[^h8432] them. 
###### 30
But the soul[^h5315] that doeth[^h6213] ought presumptuously[^h7311] [^h3027], whether he be born in the land[^h249], or a stranger[^h4480] [^h1616], the same reproacheth[^h1442] the LORD[^h3068]; and that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971]. 
###### 31
Because he hath despised[^h959] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and hath broken[^h6565] his commandment[^h4687], that soul[^h5315] shall utterly[^h3772] be cut off[^h3772]; his iniquity[^h5771] shall be upon him.
###### 32
And while the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were in the wilderness[^h4057], they found[^h4672] a man[^h376] that gathered[^h7197] sticks[^h6086] upon the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117].
###### 33
And they that found[^h4672] him gathering[^h7197] sticks[^h6086] brought[^h7126] him unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], and unto all the congregation[^h5712].
###### 34
And they put[^h3240] him in ward[^h4929], because it was not declared[^h6567] what should be done[^h6213] to him.
###### 35
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], The man[^h376] shall be surely[^h4191] put to death[^h4191]: all the congregation[^h5712] shall stone[^h7275] him with stones[^h68] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264].
###### 36
And all the congregation[^h5712] brought[^h3318] him without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264], and stoned[^h7275] him with stones[^h68], and he died[^h4191]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 37
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 38
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and bid[^h559] them that they make[^h6213] them fringes[^h6734] in the borders[^h3671] of their garments[^h899] throughout their generations[^h1755], and that they put[^h5414] upon the fringe[^h6734] of the borders[^h3671] a ribband[^h6616] of blue[^h8504]:
###### 39
And it shall be unto you for a fringe[^h6734], that ye may look[^h7200] upon it, and remember[^h2142] all the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068], and do[^h6213] them; and that ye seek[^h8446] not after[^h310] your own heart[^h3824] and your own eyes[^h5869], after[^h310] which ye use to go a whoring[^h2181]:
###### 40
That ye may remember[^h2142], and do[^h6213] all my commandments[^h4687], and be[^h1961] holy[^h6918] unto your God[^h430].
###### 41
I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which brought you out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], to be your God[^h430]: I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].

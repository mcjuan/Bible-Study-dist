###### 1
Then came[^h935] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], even the whole congregation[^h5712], into the desert[^h4057] of Zin[^h6790] in the first[^h7223] month[^h2320]: and the people[^h5971] abode[^h3427] in Kadesh[^h6946]; and Miriam[^h4813] died[^h4191] there, and was buried[^h6912] there.
###### 2
And there was no water[^h4325] for the congregation[^h5712]: and they gathered[^h6950] themselves together against Moses[^h4872] and against Aaron[^h175].
###### 3
And the people[^h5971] chode[^h7378] with Moses[^h4872], and spake[^h559], saying[^h559], Would God that[^h3863] we had died[^h1478] when our brethren[^h251] died[^h1478] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]!
###### 4
And why have ye brought up[^h935] the congregation[^h6951] of the LORD[^h3068] into this wilderness[^h4057], that we and our cattle[^h1165] should die[^h4191] there?
###### 5
And wherefore have ye made us to come up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], to bring[^h935] us in unto this evil[^h7451] place[^h4725]? it is no place[^h4725] of seed[^h2233], or of figs[^h8384], or of vines[^h1612], or of pomegranates[^h7416]; neither is there any water[^h4325] to drink[^h8354].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went[^h935] from the presence[^h6440] of the assembly[^h6951] unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and they fell[^h5307] upon their faces[^h6440]: and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto them.
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 8
Take[^h3947] the rod[^h4294], and gather[^h6950] thou the assembly[^h5712] together, thou, and Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251], and speak[^h1696] ye unto the rock[^h5553] before their eyes[^h5869]; and it shall give forth[^h5414] his water[^h4325], and thou shalt bring forth[^h3318] to them water[^h4325] out of the rock[^h5553]: so thou shalt give[^h8248] the congregation[^h5712] and their beasts[^h1165] drink[^h8248].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] the rod[^h4294] from before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], as he commanded[^h6680] him.
###### 10
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] gathered[^h6950] the congregation[^h6951] together before[^h6440] the rock[^h5553], and he said[^h559] unto them, Hear[^h8085] now, ye rebels[^h4784]; must we fetch[^h3318] you water[^h4325] out of this rock[^h5553]?
###### 11
And Moses[^h4872] lifted up[^h7311] his hand[^h3027], and with his rod[^h4294] he smote[^h5221] the rock[^h5553] twice[^h6471]: and the water[^h4325] came out[^h3318] abundantly[^h7227], and the congregation[^h5712] drank[^h8354], and their beasts[^h1165] also.
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], Because ye believed[^h539] me not, to sanctify[^h6942] me in the eyes[^h5869] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], therefore ye shall not bring[^h935] this congregation[^h6951] into the land[^h776] which I have given[^h5414] them.
###### 13
This is [^h1992] the water[^h4325] of Meribah[^h4809]; because the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] strove[^h7378] with the LORD[^h3068], and he was sanctified[^h6942] in them. 
###### 14
And Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] from Kadesh[^h6946] unto the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123], Thus saith[^h559] thy brother[^h251] Israel[^h3478], Thou knowest[^h3045] all the travail[^h8513] that hath befallen[^h4672] us: 
###### 15
How our fathers[^h1] went down[^h3381] into Egypt[^h4714], and we have dwelt[^h3427] in Egypt[^h4714] a long[^h7227] time[^h3117]; and the Egyptians[^h4714] vexed[^h7489] us, and our fathers[^h1]:
###### 16
And when we cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068], he heard[^h8085] our voice[^h6963], and sent[^h7971] an angel[^h4397], and hath brought us forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]: and, behold, we are in Kadesh[^h6946], a city[^h5892] in the uttermost[^h7097] of thy border[^h1366]:
###### 17
Let us pass[^h5674], I pray thee, through thy country[^h776]: we will not pass[^h5674] through the fields[^h7704], or through the vineyards[^h3754], neither will we drink[^h8354] of the water[^h4325] of the wells[^h875]: we will go[^h3212] by the king's[^h4428] high way[^h1870], we will not turn[^h5186] to the right hand[^h3225] nor to the left[^h8040], until we have passed[^h5674] thy borders[^h1366].
###### 18
And Edom[^h123] said[^h559] unto him, Thou shalt not pass[^h5674] by me, lest I come out[^h3318] against[^h7125] thee with the sword[^h2719].
###### 19
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto him, We will go[^h5927] by the high way[^h4546]: and if I and my cattle[^h4735] drink[^h8354] of thy water[^h4325], then I will pay[^h5414] [^h4377] for it: I will only, without doing any thing[^h1697] else, go through[^h5674] on my feet[^h7272].
###### 20
And he said[^h559], Thou shalt not go through[^h5674]. And Edom[^h123] came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] him with much[^h3515] people[^h5971], and with a strong[^h2389] hand[^h3027].
###### 21
Thus Edom[^h123] refused[^h3985] to give[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] passage[^h5674] through his border[^h1366]: wherefore Israel[^h3478] turned away[^h5186] from him.
###### 22
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], even the whole congregation[^h5712], journeyed[^h5265] from Kadesh[^h6946], and came[^h935] unto mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023].
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] in mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023], by the coast[^h1366] of the land[^h776] of Edom[^h123], saying[^h559],
###### 24
Aaron[^h175] shall be gathered[^h622] unto his people[^h5971]: for he shall not enter[^h935] into the land[^h776] which I have given[^h5414] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], because ye rebelled against[^h4784] my word[^h6310] at the water[^h4325] of Meribah[^h4809]. 
###### 25
Take[^h3947] Aaron[^h175] and Eleazar[^h499] his son[^h1121], and bring them up[^h5927] unto mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023]:
###### 26
And strip[^h6584] Aaron[^h175] of his garments[^h899], and put[^h3847] them upon Eleazar[^h499] his son[^h1121]: and Aaron[^h175] shall be gathered[^h622] unto his people, and shall die[^h4191] there.
###### 27
And Moses[^h4872] did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680]: and they went up[^h5927] into mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023] in the sight[^h5869] of all the congregation[^h5712].
###### 28
And Moses[^h4872] stripped[^h6584] Aaron[^h175] of his garments[^h899], and put[^h3847] them upon Eleazar[^h499] his son[^h1121]; and Aaron[^h175] died[^h4191] there in the top[^h7218] of the mount[^h2022]: and Moses[^h4872] and Eleazar[^h499] came down[^h3381] from the mount[^h2022].
###### 29
And when all the congregation[^h5712] saw[^h7200] that Aaron[^h175] was dead[^h1478], they mourned[^h1058] for Aaron[^h175] thirty[^h7970] days[^h3117], even all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].

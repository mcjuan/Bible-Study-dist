Whosoever toucheth[^h5060] the dead[^h4191] body[^h5315] of any man[^h120] that is dead[^h4191], and purifieth[^h2398] not himself, defileth[^h2930] the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068]; and that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from Israel[^h3478]: because the water[^h4325] of separation[^h5079] was not sprinkled[^h2236] upon him, he shall be unclean[^h2931]; his uncleanness[^h2932] is yet upon him.

And it shall be a perpetual[^h5769] statute[^h2708] unto them, that he that sprinkleth[^h5137] the water[^h4325] of separation[^h5079] shall wash[^h3526] his clothes[^h899]; and he that toucheth[^h5060] the water[^h4325] of separation[^h5079] shall be unclean[^h2930] until even[^h6153].

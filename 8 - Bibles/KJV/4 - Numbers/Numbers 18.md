###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Thou and thy sons[^h1121] and thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004] with thee shall bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of the sanctuary[^h4720]: and thou and thy sons[^h1121] with thee shall bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of your priesthood[^h3550].
###### 2
And thy brethren[^h251] also of the tribe[^h4294] of Levi[^h3878], the tribe[^h7626] of thy father[^h1], bring[^h7126] thou with thee, that they may be joined[^h3867] unto thee, and minister[^h8334] unto thee: but thou and thy sons[^h1121] with thee shall minister before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of witness[^h5715].
###### 3
And they shall keep[^h8104] thy charge[^h4931], and the charge[^h4931] of all the tabernacle[^h168]: only they shall not come nigh[^h7126] the vessels[^h3627] of the sanctuary[^h6944] and the altar[^h4196], that neither they, nor ye also, die[^h4191].
###### 4
And they shall be joined[^h3867] unto thee, and keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], for all the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h168]: and a stranger[^h2114] shall not come nigh[^h7126] unto you.
###### 5
And ye shall keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the sanctuary[^h6944], and the charge[^h4931] of the altar[^h4196]: that there be no wrath[^h7110] any more upon the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
And I, behold, I have taken[^h3947] your brethren[^h251] the Levites[^h3881] from among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: to you they are given[^h5414] as a gift[^h4979] for the LORD[^h3068], to do[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 7
Therefore thou and thy sons[^h1121] with thee shall keep[^h8104] your priest's office[^h3550] for every thing[^h1697] of the altar[^h4196], and within[^h1004] the vail[^h6532]; and ye shall serve[^h5647]: I have given[^h5414] your priest's office[^h3550] unto you as a service[^h5656] of gift[^h4979]: and the stranger[^h2114] that cometh nigh[^h7131] shall be put to death[^h4191].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], Behold, I also have given[^h5414] thee the charge[^h4931] of mine heave offerings[^h8641] of all the hallowed things[^h6944] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; unto thee have I given[^h5414] them by reason of the anointing[^h4888], and to thy sons[^h1121], by an ordinance[^h2706] for ever[^h5769].
###### 9
This shall be thine of the most[^h6944] holy things[^h6944], reserved from the fire[^h784]: every oblation[^h7133] of theirs, every meat offering[^h4503] of theirs, and every sin offering[^h2403] of theirs, and every trespass offering[^h817] of theirs, which they shall render[^h7725] unto me, shall be most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] for thee and for thy sons[^h1121].
###### 10
In the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place shalt thou eat[^h398] it; every male[^h2145] shall eat[^h398] it: it shall be holy[^h6944] unto thee.
###### 11
And this is thine; the heave offering[^h8641] of their gift[^h4976], with all the wave offerings[^h8573] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: I have given[^h5414] them unto thee, and to thy sons[^h1121] and to thy daughters[^h1323] with thee, by a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769]: every one that is clean[^h2889] in thy house[^h1004] shall eat[^h398] of it.
###### 12
All the best[^h2459] of the oil[^h3323], and all the best[^h2459] of the wine[^h8492], and of the wheat[^h1715], the firstfruits[^h7225] of them which they shall offer[^h5414] unto the LORD[^h3068], them have I given[^h5414] thee. 
###### 13
And whatsoever is first ripe[^h1061] in the land[^h776], which they shall bring[^h935] unto the LORD[^h3068], shall be thine; every one that is clean[^h2889] in thine house[^h1004] shall eat[^h398] of it.
###### 14
Every thing devoted[^h2764] in Israel[^h3478] shall be thine.
###### 15
Every thing that openeth[^h6363] the matrix[^h7358] in all flesh[^h1320], which they bring[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068], whether it be of men[^h120] or beasts[^h929], shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn[^h1060] of man[^h120] shalt thou surely[^h6299] redeem[^h6299], and the firstling[^h1060] of unclean[^h2931] beasts[^h929] shalt thou redeem[^h6299].
###### 16
And those that are to be redeemed[^h6299] from a month[^h2320] old[^h1121] shalt thou redeem[^h6299], according to thine estimation[^h6187], for the money[^h3701] of five[^h2568] shekels[^h8255], after the shekel[^h8255] of the sanctuary[^h6944], which is twenty[^h6242] gerahs[^h1626].
###### 17
But the firstling[^h1060] of a cow[^h7794], or the firstling[^h1060] of a sheep[^h3775], or the firstling[^h1060] of a goat[^h5795], thou shalt not redeem[^h6299]; they are holy[^h6944]: thou shalt sprinkle[^h2236] their blood[^h1818] upon the altar[^h4196], and shalt burn[^h6999] their fat[^h2459] for an offering made by fire[^h801], for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
And the flesh[^h1320] of them shall be thine, as the wave[^h8573] breast[^h2373] and as the right[^h3225] shoulder[^h7785] are thine.
###### 19
All the heave offerings[^h8641] of the holy things[^h6944], which the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] offer[^h7311] unto the LORD[^h3068], have I given[^h5414] thee, and thy sons[^h1121] and thy daughters[^h1323] with thee, by a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769]: it is a covenant[^h1285] of salt[^h4417] for ever[^h5769] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] unto thee and to thy seed[^h2233] with thee.
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Thou shalt have no inheritance[^h5157] in their land[^h776], neither shalt thou have any part[^h2506] among[^h8432] them: I am thy part[^h2506] and thine inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 21
And, behold, I have given[^h5414] the children[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] all the tenth[^h4643] in Israel[^h3478] for an inheritance[^h5159], for[^h2500] their service[^h5656] which they serve[^h5647], even the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 22
Neither must the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] henceforth[^h5750] come nigh[^h7126] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], lest they bear[^h5375] sin[^h2399], and die[^h4191]. 
###### 23
But the Levites[^h3881] shall do[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and they shall bear[^h5375] their iniquity[^h5771]: it shall be a statute[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] throughout your generations[^h1755], that among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] they have[^h5157] no inheritance[^h5159].
###### 24
But the tithes[^h4643] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which they offer[^h7311] as an heave offering[^h8641] unto the LORD[^h3068], I have given[^h5414] to the Levites[^h3881] to inherit[^h5159]: therefore I have said[^h559] unto them, Among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] they shall have[^h5157] no inheritance[^h5159].
###### 25
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 26
Thus speak[^h1696] unto the Levites[^h3881], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye take[^h3947] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] the tithes[^h4643] which I have given[^h5414] you from them for your inheritance[^h5159], then ye shall offer[^h7311] up an heave offering[^h8641] of it for the LORD[^h3068], even a tenth[^h4643] part of the tithe[^h4643].
###### 27
And this your heave offering[^h8641] shall be reckoned[^h2803] unto you, as though it were the corn[^h1715] of the threshingfloor[^h1637], and as the fulness[^h4395] of the winepress[^h3342].
###### 28
Thus ye also shall offer[^h7311] an heave offering[^h8641] unto the LORD[^h3068] of all your tithes[^h4643], which ye receive[^h3947] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; and ye shall give[^h5414] thereof the LORD'S[^h3068] heave offering[^h8641] to Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548].
###### 29
Out of all your gifts[^h4979] ye shall offer[^h7311] every heave offering[^h8641] of the LORD[^h3068], of all the best[^h2459] thereof, even the hallowed part[^h4720] thereof out of it. 
###### 30
Therefore thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, When ye have heaved[^h7311] the best[^h2459] thereof from it, then it shall be counted[^h2803] unto the Levites[^h3881] as the increase[^h8393] of the threshingfloor[^h1637], and as the increase[^h8393] of the winepress[^h3342]. 
###### 31
And ye shall eat[^h398] it in every place[^h4725], ye and your households[^h1004]: for it is your reward[^h7939] for[^h2500] your service[^h5656] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 32
And ye shall bear[^h5375] no sin[^h2399] by reason of it, when ye have heaved[^h7311] from it the best[^h2459] of it: neither shall ye pollute[^h2490] the holy things[^h6944] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], lest ye die[^h4191].

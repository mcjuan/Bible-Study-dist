###### 1
Then came[^h7126] the daughters[^h1323] of Zelophehad[^h6765], the son[^h1121] of Hepher[^h2660], the son[^h1121] of Gilead[^h1568], the son[^h1121] of Machir[^h4353], the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519], of the families[^h4940] of Manasseh[^h4519] the son[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130]: and these are the names[^h8034] of his daughters[^h1323]; Mahlah[^h4244], Noah[^h5270], and Hoglah[^h2295], and Milcah[^h4435], and Tirzah[^h8656].
###### 2
And they stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Moses[^h4872], and before[^h6440] Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and before[^h6440] the princes[^h5387] and all the congregation[^h5712], by the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], saying[^h559],
###### 3
Our father[^h1] died[^h4191] in the wilderness[^h4057], and he was not in[^h8432] the company[^h5712] of them that gathered themselves together[^h3259] against the LORD[^h3068] in the company[^h5712] of Korah[^h7141]; but died[^h4191] in his own sin[^h2399], and had no sons[^h1121].
###### 4
Why should the name[^h8034] of our father[^h1] be done away[^h1639] from among[^h8432] his family[^h4940], because he hath no son[^h1121]? Give[^h5414] unto us therefore a possession[^h272] among[^h8432] the brethren[^h251] of our father[^h1]. 
###### 5
And Moses[^h4872] brought[^h7126] their cause[^h4941] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 7
The daughters[^h1323] of Zelophehad[^h6765] speak[^h1696] right[^h3651]: thou shalt surely[^h5414] give[^h5414] them a possession[^h272] of an inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] their father's[^h1] brethren[^h251]; and thou shalt cause the inheritance[^h5159] of their father[^h1] to pass[^h5674] unto them.
###### 8
And thou shalt speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], If a man[^h376] die[^h4191], and have no son[^h1121], then ye shall cause his inheritance[^h5159] to pass[^h5674] unto his daughter[^h1323].
###### 9
And if he have no daughter[^h1323], then ye shall give[^h5414] his inheritance[^h5159] unto his brethren[^h251].
###### 10
And if he have no brethren[^h251], then ye shall give[^h5414] his inheritance[^h5159] unto his father's[^h1] brethren[^h251].
###### 11
And if his father[^h1] have no brethren[^h251], then ye shall give[^h5414] his inheritance[^h5159] unto his kinsman[^h7607] that is next[^h7138] to him of his family[^h4940], and he shall possess[^h3423] it: and it shall be unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] a statute[^h2708] of judgment[^h4941], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Get thee up[^h5927] into this mount[^h2022] Abarim[^h5682], and see[^h7200] the land[^h776] which I have given[^h5414] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 13
And when thou hast seen[^h7200] it, thou also shalt be gathered[^h622] unto thy people[^h5971], as Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251] was gathered[^h622].
###### 14
For ye rebelled[^h4784] against my commandment[^h6310] in the desert[^h4057] of Zin[^h6790], in the strife[^h4808] of the congregation[^h5712], to sanctify[^h6942] me at the water[^h4325] before their eyes[^h5869]: that is the water[^h4325] of Meribah[^h4809] in Kadesh[^h6946] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Zin[^h6790].
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 16
Let the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of the spirits[^h7307] of all flesh[^h1320], set[^h6485] a man[^h376] over the congregation[^h5712],
###### 17
Which may go out[^h3318] before[^h6440] them, and which may go in[^h935] before[^h6440] them, and which may lead them out[^h3318], and which may bring them in[^h935]; that the congregation[^h5712] of the LORD[^h3068] be not as sheep[^h6629] which have no shepherd[^h7462].
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Take[^h3947] thee Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], a man[^h376] in whom is the spirit[^h7307], and lay[^h5564] thine hand[^h3027] upon him;
###### 19
And set[^h5975] him before[^h6440] Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and before[^h6440] all the congregation[^h5712]; and give him a charge[^h6680] in their sight[^h5869].
###### 20
And thou shalt put[^h5414] some of thine honour[^h1935] upon him, that all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] may be obedient[^h8085].
###### 21
And he shall stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], who shall ask[^h7592] counsel for him after the judgment[^h4941] of Urim[^h224] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: at his word[^h6310] shall they go out[^h3318], and at his word[^h6310] they shall come in[^h935], both he, and all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] with him, even all the congregation[^h5712].
###### 22
And Moses[^h4872] did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] him: and he took[^h3947] Joshua[^h3091], and set[^h5975] him before[^h6440] Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and before[^h6440] all the congregation[^h5712]:
###### 23
And he laid[^h5564] his hands[^h3027] upon him, and gave him a charge[^h6680], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].

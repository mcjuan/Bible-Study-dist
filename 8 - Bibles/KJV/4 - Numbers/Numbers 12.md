###### 1
And Miriam[^h4813] and Aaron[^h175] spake[^h1696] against Moses[^h4872] because of[^h182] the Ethiopian[^h3571] woman[^h802] whom he had married[^h3947]: for he had married[^h3947] an Ethiopian[^h3571] woman[^h802].  
###### 2
And they said[^h559], Hath the LORD[^h3068] indeed spoken[^h1696] only by Moses[^h4872]? hath he not spoken[^h1696] also by us? And the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] it.
###### 3
(Now the man[^h376] Moses[^h4872] was very[^h3966] meek[^h6035] [^h6035], above all the men[^h120] which were upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127].)
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] suddenly[^h6597] unto Moses[^h4872], and unto Aaron[^h175], and unto Miriam[^h4813], Come out[^h3318] ye three[^h7969] unto the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]. And they three[^h7969] came out[^h3318].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] came down[^h3381] in the pillar[^h5982] of the cloud[^h6051], and stood[^h5975] in the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168], and called[^h7121] Aaron[^h175] and Miriam[^h4813]: and they both[^h8147] came forth[^h3318].
###### 6
And he said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] now my words[^h1697]: If there be a prophet[^h5030] among you, I the LORD[^h3068] will make myself known[^h3045] unto him in a vision[^h4759], and will speak[^h1696] unto him in a dream[^h2472].
###### 7
My servant[^h5650] Moses[^h4872] is not so, who is faithful[^h539] in all mine house[^h1004].
###### 8
With him will I speak[^h1696] mouth[^h6310] to mouth[^h6310], even apparently[^h4758], and not in dark speeches[^h2420]; and the similitude[^h8544] of the LORD[^h3068] shall he behold[^h5027]: wherefore then were ye not afraid[^h3372] to speak[^h1696] against my servant[^h5650] Moses[^h4872]?
###### 9
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against them; and he departed[^h3212].
###### 10
And the cloud[^h6051] departed[^h5493] from off the tabernacle[^h168]; and, behold, Miriam[^h4813] became leprous[^h6879], white as snow[^h7950]: and Aaron[^h175] looked[^h6437] upon Miriam[^h4813], and, behold, she was leprous[^h6879].
###### 11
And Aaron[^h175] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Alas[^h994], my lord[^h113], I beseech thee, lay[^h7896] not the sin[^h2403] upon us, wherein we have done foolishly[^h2973], and wherein we have sinned[^h2398].
###### 12
Let her not be as one dead[^h4994] [^h4191], of whom the flesh[^h1320] is half[^h2677] consumed[^h398] when he cometh out[^h3318] of his mother's[^h517] womb[^h7358].
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872] cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Heal[^h7495] her now, O God[^h410], I beseech thee.
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], If her father[^h1] had but[^h3417] spit[^h3417] in her face[^h6440], should she not be ashamed[^h3637] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]? let her be shut[^h5462] out[^h2351] from the camp[^h4264] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], and after[^h310] that let her be received[^h622] in again.
###### 15
And Miriam[^h4813] was shut[^h5462] out[^h2351] from the camp[^h4264] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]: and the people[^h5971] journeyed[^h5265] not till Miriam[^h4813] was brought[^h622] in again.
###### 16
And afterward[^h310] the people[^h5971] removed[^h5265] from Hazeroth[^h2698], and pitched[^h2583] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Paran[^h6290].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Command[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they put out[^h7971] of the camp[^h4264] every leper[^h6879], and every one that hath an issue[^h2100], and whosoever is defiled[^h2931] by the dead[^h5315]:
###### 3
Both male[^h2145] and female[^h5347] shall ye put out[^h7971], without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264] shall ye put[^h7971] them; that they defile[^h2930] not their camps[^h4264], in the midst[^h8432] whereof[^h834] I dwell[^h7931].
###### 4
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did so[^h6213], and put them out[^h7971] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264]: as the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], so did[^h6213] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 6
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], When a man[^h376] or woman[^h802] shall commit[^h6213] any sin[^h2403] that men[^h120] commit[^h4603], to do a trespass[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068], and that person[^h5315] be guilty[^h816];
###### 7
Then they shall confess[^h3034] their sin[^h2403] which they have done[^h6213]: and he shall recompense[^h7725] his trespass[^h817] with the principal[^h7218] thereof, and add[^h3254] unto it the fifth[^h2549] part thereof, and give[^h5414] it unto him against whom he hath trespassed[^h816].
###### 8
But if the man[^h376] have no kinsman[^h1350] to recompense[^h7725] the trespass[^h817] unto, let the trespass[^h817] be recompensed[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068], even to the priest[^h3548]; beside the ram[^h352] of the atonement[^h3725], whereby an atonement shall be made[^h3722] for him.
###### 9
And every offering[^h8641] of all the holy things[^h6944] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which they bring[^h7126] unto the priest[^h3548], shall be his. 
###### 10
And every man's[^h376] hallowed things[^h6944] shall be his: whatsoever any man[^h376] giveth[^h5414] the priest[^h3548], it shall be his.
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 12
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, If any[^h376] man's[^h376] wife[^h802] go aside[^h7847], and commit[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604] against him,
###### 13
And a man[^h376] lie[^h7901] with her carnally[^h7902] [^h2233], and it be hid[^h5956] from the eyes[^h5869] of her husband[^h376], and be kept close[^h5641], and she be defiled[^h2930], and there be no witness[^h5707] against her, neither she be taken[^h8610] with the manner;
###### 14
And the spirit[^h7307] of jealousy[^h7068] come[^h5674] upon him, and he be jealous[^h7065] of his wife[^h802], and she be defiled[^h2930]: or if the spirit[^h7307] of jealousy[^h7068] come[^h5674] upon him, and he be jealous[^h7065] of his wife[^h802], and she be not defiled[^h2930]:
###### 15
Then shall the man[^h376] bring[^h935] his wife[^h802] unto the priest[^h3548], and he shall bring[^h935] her offering[^h7133] for her, the tenth[^h6224] part of an ephah[^h374] of barley[^h8184] meal[^h7058]; he shall pour[^h3332] no oil[^h8081] upon it, nor put[^h5414] frankincense[^h3828] thereon; for it is an offering[^h4503] of jealousy[^h7068], an offering[^h4503] of memorial[^h2146], bringing[^h2142] iniquity[^h5771] to remembrance[^h2142].
###### 16
And the priest[^h3548] shall bring her near[^h7126], and set[^h5975] her before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 17
And the priest[^h3548] shall take[^h3947] holy[^h6918] water[^h4325] in an earthen[^h2789] vessel[^h3627]; and of the dust[^h6083] that is in the floor[^h7172] of the tabernacle[^h4908] the priest[^h3548] shall take[^h3947], and put[^h5414] it into the water[^h4325]:
###### 18
And the priest[^h3548] shall set[^h5975] the woman[^h802] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and uncover[^h6544] the woman's[^h802] head[^h7218], and put[^h5414] the offering[^h4503] of memorial[^h2146] in her hands[^h3709], which is the jealousy[^h7068] offering[^h4503]: and the priest[^h3548] shall have in his hand[^h3027] the bitter[^h4751] water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779]:
###### 19
And the priest[^h3548] shall charge her by an oath[^h7650], and say[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], If no man[^h376] have lain[^h7901] with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside[^h7847] to uncleanness[^h2932] with another instead of thy husband[^h376], be thou free[^h5352] from this bitter[^h4751] water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779]: 
###### 20
But if thou hast gone aside[^h7847] to another instead of thy husband[^h376], and if thou be defiled[^h2930], and some man[^h376] have[^h5414] lain[^h7903] with thee beside[^h1107] thine husband[^h376]:
###### 21
Then the priest[^h3548] shall charge[^h7650] the woman[^h802] with an oath[^h7621] of cursing[^h423], and the priest[^h3548] shall say[^h559] unto the woman[^h802], The LORD[^h3068] make[^h5414] thee a curse[^h423] and an oath[^h7621] among[^h8432] thy people[^h5971], when the LORD[^h3068] doth make[^h5414] thy thigh[^h3409] to rot[^h5307], and thy belly[^h990] to swell[^h6639]; 
###### 22
And this water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779] shall go[^h935] into thy bowels[^h4578], to make thy belly[^h990] to swell[^h6638], and thy thigh[^h3409] to rot[^h5307]: And the woman[^h802] shall say[^h559], Amen[^h543], amen[^h543].
###### 23
And the priest[^h3548] shall write[^h3789] these curses[^h423] in a book[^h5612], and he shall blot[^h4229] them out with the bitter[^h4751] water[^h4325]:
###### 24
And he shall cause the woman[^h802] to drink[^h8248] the bitter[^h4751] water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779]: and the water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779] shall enter[^h935] into her, and become bitter[^h4751].
###### 25
Then the priest[^h3548] shall take[^h3947] the jealousy[^h7068] offering[^h4503] out of the woman's[^h802] hand[^h3027], and shall wave[^h5130] the offering[^h4503] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and offer[^h7126] it upon the altar[^h4196]:
###### 26
And the priest[^h3548] shall take an handful[^h7061] of the offering[^h4503], even the memorial[^h234] thereof, and burn[^h6999] it upon the altar[^h4196], and afterward[^h310] shall cause the woman[^h802] to drink[^h8248] the water[^h4325].
###### 27
And when he hath made her to drink[^h8248] the water[^h4325], then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled[^h2930], and have done[^h4603] trespass[^h4604] against her husband[^h376], that the water[^h4325] that causeth the curse[^h779] shall enter[^h935] into her, and become bitter[^h4751], and her belly[^h990] shall swell[^h6638], and her thigh[^h3409] shall rot[^h5307]: and the woman[^h802] shall be a curse[^h423] among[^h7130] her people[^h5971].
###### 28
And if the woman[^h802] be not defiled[^h2930], but be clean[^h2889]; then she shall be free[^h5352], and shall conceive[^h2232] seed[^h2233].
###### 29
This is the law[^h8451] of jealousies[^h7068], when a wife[^h802] goeth aside[^h7847] to another instead of her husband[^h376], and is defiled[^h2930];
###### 30
Or when the spirit[^h7307] of jealousy[^h7068] cometh[^h5674] upon him[^h376], and he be jealous[^h7065] over his wife[^h802], and shall set[^h5975] the woman[^h802] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and the priest[^h3548] shall execute[^h6213] upon her all this law[^h8451].
###### 31
Then shall the man[^h376] be guiltless[^h5352] from iniquity[^h5771], and this[^h1931] woman[^h802] shall bear[^h5375] her iniquity[^h5771].

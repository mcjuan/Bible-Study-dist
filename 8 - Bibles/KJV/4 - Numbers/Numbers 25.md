###### 1
And Israel[^h3478] abode[^h3427] in Shittim[^h7851], and the people[^h5971] began[^h2490] to commit whoredom[^h2181] with the daughters[^h1323] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 2
And they called[^h7121] the people[^h5971] unto the sacrifices[^h2077] of their gods[^h430]: and the people[^h5971] did eat[^h398], and bowed down[^h7812] to their gods[^h430].
###### 3
And Israel[^h3478] joined[^h6775] himself unto Baalpeor[^h1187]: and the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Take[^h3947] all the heads[^h7218] of the people[^h5971], and hang them up[^h3363] before[^h5048] the LORD[^h3068] against the sun[^h8121], that the fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] may be turned away[^h7725] from Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the judges[^h8199] of Israel[^h3478], Slay[^h2026] ye every[^h376] one[^h376] his men[^h582] that were joined[^h6775] unto Baalpeor[^h1187].
###### 6
And, behold, one[^h376] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] and brought[^h7126] unto his brethren[^h251] a Midianitish woman[^h4084] in the sight[^h5869] of Moses[^h4872], and in the sight[^h5869] of all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], who were weeping[^h1058] before the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 7
And when Phinehas[^h6372], the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499], the son[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548], saw[^h7200] it, he rose up[^h6965] from among[^h8432] the congregation[^h5712], and took[^h3947] a javelin[^h7420] in his hand[^h3027];
###### 8
And he went[^h935] after[^h310] the man[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] into the tent[^h6898], and thrust[^h1856] both[^h8147] of them through, the man[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], and the woman[^h802] through[^h413] her belly[^h6897]. So the plague[^h4046] was stayed[^h6113] from the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 9
And those that died[^h4191] in the plague[^h4046] were twenty[^h6242] and four[^h702] thousand[^h505].
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 11
Phinehas[^h6372], the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499], the son[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548], hath turned[^h7725] my wrath[^h2534] away[^h7725] from the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], while he was zealous[^h7065] for my sake[^h7068] among[^h8432] them, that I consumed[^h3615] not the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in my jealousy[^h7068]. 
###### 12
Wherefore say[^h559], Behold, I give[^h5414] unto him my covenant[^h1285] of peace[^h7965]:
###### 13
And he shall have it, and his seed[^h2233] after[^h310] him, even the covenant[^h1285] of an everlasting[^h5769] priesthood[^h3550]; because[^h834] he was zealous[^h7065] for his God[^h430], and made an atonement[^h3722] for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
Now the name[^h8034] of the Israelite[^h376] that was slain[^h5221], even that was slain[^h5221] with the Midianitish woman[^h4084], was Zimri[^h2174], the son[^h1121] of Salu[^h5543], a prince[^h5387] of a chief[^h1] house[^h1004] among the Simeonites[^h8099]. 
###### 15
And the name[^h8034] of the Midianitish[^h4084] woman[^h802] that was slain[^h5221] was Cozbi[^h3579], the daughter[^h1323] of Zur[^h6698]; he was head[^h7218] over a people[^h523], and of a chief[^h1] house[^h1004] in Midian[^h4080].
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 17
Vex[^h6887] the Midianites[^h4084], and smite[^h5221] them:
###### 18
For they vex[^h6887] you with their wiles[^h5231], wherewith they have beguiled[^h5230] you in the matter[^h1697] of Peor[^h6465], and in the matter[^h1697] of Cozbi[^h3579], the daughter[^h1323] of a prince[^h5387] of Midian[^h4080], their sister[^h269], which was slain[^h5221] in the day[^h3117] of the plague[^h4046] for Peor's[^h6465] sake[^h1697].

###### 1
And when the people[^h5971] complained[^h596], it displeased[^h7451] [^h241] the LORD[^h3068]: and the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] it; and his anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734]; and the fire[^h784] of the LORD[^h3068] burnt[^h1197] among them, and consumed[^h398] them that were in the uttermost parts[^h7097] of the camp[^h4264].  
###### 2
And the people[^h5971] cried[^h6817] unto Moses[^h4872]; and when Moses[^h4872] prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], the fire[^h784] was quenched[^h8257]. 
###### 3
And he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the[^h1931] place[^h4725] Taberah[^h8404]: because the fire[^h784] of the LORD[^h3068] burnt[^h1197] among them. 
###### 4
And the mixt multitude[^h628] that was among[^h7130] them fell a lusting[^h183] [^h8378]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] also wept[^h1058] again[^h7725], and said[^h559], Who shall give us flesh[^h1320] to eat[^h398]?  
###### 5
We remember[^h2142] the fish[^h1710], which we did eat[^h398] in Egypt[^h4714] freely[^h2600]; the cucumbers[^h7180], and the melons[^h20], and the leeks[^h2682], and the onions[^h1211], and the garlick[^h7762]:
###### 6
But now our soul[^h5315] is dried away[^h3002]: there is nothing at all, beside[^h1115] this manna[^h4478], before our eyes[^h5869].
###### 7
And the manna[^h4478] was as coriander[^h1407] seed[^h2233], and the colour[^h5869] thereof as the colour[^h5869] of bdellium[^h916]. 
###### 8
And the people[^h5971] went about[^h7751], and gathered[^h3950] it, and ground[^h2912] it in mills[^h7347], or beat[^h1743] it in a mortar[^h4085], and baked[^h1310] it in pans[^h6517], and made[^h6213] cakes[^h5692] of it: and the taste[^h2940] of it was as the taste[^h2940] of fresh[^h3955] oil[^h8081].
###### 9
And when the dew[^h2919] fell[^h3381] upon the camp[^h4264] in the night[^h3915], the manna[^h4478] fell[^h3381] upon it.
###### 10
Then Moses[^h4872] heard[^h8085] the people[^h5971] weep[^h1058] throughout their families[^h4940], every man[^h376] in the door[^h6607] of his tent[^h168]: and the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] greatly[^h3966]; Moses[^h4872] also was displeased[^h7489] [^h5869].
###### 11
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], Wherefore hast thou afflicted[^h7489] thy servant[^h5650]? and wherefore have I not found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], that thou layest[^h7760] the burden[^h4853] of all this people[^h5971] upon me?
###### 12
Have I conceived[^h2029] all this people[^h5971]? have I begotten[^h3205] them, that thou shouldest say[^h559] unto me, Carry[^h5375] them in thy bosom[^h2436], as a nursing father[^h539] beareth[^h5375] the sucking child[^h3243], unto the land[^h127] which thou swarest[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1]?
###### 13
Whence[^h370] should I have flesh[^h1320] to give[^h5414] unto all this people[^h5971]? for they weep[^h1058] unto me, saying[^h559], Give[^h5414] us flesh[^h1320], that we may eat[^h398].
###### 14
I am not able[^h3201] to bear[^h5375] all this people[^h5971] alone[^h905], because it is too heavy[^h3515] for me.
###### 15
And if thou deal[^h6213] thus with me, kill[^h2026] me, I pray thee, out of hand[^h2026], if I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869]; and let me not see[^h7200] my wretchedness[^h7451].
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Gather[^h622] unto me seventy[^h7657] men[^h376] of the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], whom thou knowest[^h3045] to be the elders[^h2205] of the people[^h5971], and officers[^h7860] over them; and bring[^h3947] them unto the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], that they may stand[^h3320] there with thee.
###### 17
And I will come down[^h3381] and talk[^h1696] with thee there: and I will take[^h680] of the spirit[^h7307] which is upon thee, and will put[^h7760] it upon them; and they shall bear[^h5375] the burden[^h4853] of the people[^h5971] with thee, that thou bear[^h5375] it not thyself alone.
###### 18
And say[^h559] thou unto the people[^h5971], Sanctify[^h6942] yourselves against to morrow[^h4279], and ye shall eat[^h398] flesh[^h1320]: for ye have wept[^h1058] in the ears[^h241] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Who shall give us flesh[^h1320] to eat[^h398]? for it was well[^h2895] with us in Egypt[^h4714]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] will give[^h5414] you flesh[^h1320], and ye shall eat[^h398].
###### 19
Ye shall not eat[^h398] one[^h259] day[^h3117], nor two days[^h3117], nor five[^h2568] days[^h3117], neither ten[^h6235] days[^h3117], nor twenty[^h6242] days[^h3117];
###### 20
But even a whole month[^h2320] [^h3117], until it come out[^h3318] at your nostrils[^h639], and it be loathsome[^h2214] unto you: because[^h3282] that ye have despised[^h3988] the LORD[^h3068] which is among[^h7130] you, and have wept[^h1058] before[^h6440] him, saying[^h559], Why came we forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]? 
###### 21
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], The people[^h5971], among[^h7130] whom I am, are six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h7273]; and thou hast said[^h559], I will give[^h5414] them flesh[^h1320], that they may eat[^h398] a whole[^h3117] month[^h2320].
###### 22
Shall the flocks[^h6629] and the herds[^h1241] be slain[^h7819] for them, to suffice[^h4672] them? or shall all the fish[^h1709] of the sea[^h3220] be gathered together[^h622] for them, to suffice[^h4672] them?
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Is the LORD'S[^h3068] hand[^h3027] waxed short[^h7114]? thou shalt see[^h7200] now whether my word[^h1697] shall come to pass[^h7136] unto thee or not.
###### 24
And Moses[^h4872] went out[^h3318], and told[^h1696] the people[^h5971] the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and gathered[^h622] the seventy[^h7657] men[^h376] of the elders[^h2205] of the people[^h5971], and set[^h5975] them round about[^h5439] the tabernacle[^h168].
###### 25
And the LORD[^h3068] came down[^h3381] in a cloud[^h6051], and spake[^h1696] unto him, and took[^h680] of the spirit[^h7307] that was upon him, and gave[^h5414] it unto the seventy[^h7657] elders[^h2205] [^h376]: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit[^h7307] rested[^h5117] upon them, they prophesied[^h5012], and did not cease[^h3254].
###### 26
But there remained[^h7604] two[^h8147] of the men[^h582] in the camp[^h4264], the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Eldad[^h419], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Medad[^h4312]: and the spirit[^h7307] rested[^h5117] upon them; and they were of them that were written[^h3789], but went not out[^h3318] unto the tabernacle[^h168]: and they prophesied[^h5012] in the camp[^h4264].
###### 27
And there ran[^h7323] a young man[^h5288], and told[^h5046] Moses[^h4872], and said[^h559], Eldad[^h419] and Medad[^h4312] do prophesy[^h5012] in the camp[^h4264].
###### 28
And Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], the servant[^h8334] of Moses[^h4872], one of his young men[^h979], answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], My lord[^h113] Moses[^h4872], forbid[^h3607] them.
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto him, Enviest[^h7065] thou for my sake? would God that all the[^h5414] LORD'S[^h3068] people[^h5971] were prophets[^h5030], and that the LORD[^h3068] would put[^h5414] his spirit[^h7307] upon them!
###### 30
And Moses[^h4872] gat[^h622] him into the camp[^h4264], he and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 31
And there went forth[^h5265] a wind[^h7307] from the LORD[^h3068], and brought[^h1468] quails[^h7958] from the sea[^h3220], and let them fall[^h5203] by the camp[^h4264], as it were a day's[^h3117] journey[^h1870] on this side[^h3541], and as it were a day's[^h3117] journey[^h1870] on the other side[^h3541], round about[^h5439] the camp[^h4264], and as it were two cubits[^h520] high upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h776]. 
###### 32
And the people[^h5971] stood up[^h6965] all that day[^h3117], and all that night[^h3915], and all the next[^h4283] day[^h3117], and they gathered[^h622] the quails[^h7958]: he that gathered least[^h4591] gathered[^h622] ten[^h6235] homers[^h2563]: and they spread[^h7849] them all abroad[^h7849] for themselves round about[^h5439] the camp[^h4264].
###### 33
And while the flesh[^h1320] was yet[^h2962] between their teeth[^h8127], ere it was chewed[^h3772], the wrath[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against the people[^h5971], and the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5221] the people[^h5971] with a very[^h3966] great[^h7227] plague[^h4347].
###### 34
And he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] Kibrothhattaavah[^h6914]: because there they buried[^h6912] the people[^h5971] that lusted[^h183]. 
###### 35
And the people[^h5971] journeyed[^h5265] from Kibrothhattaavah[^h6914] unto Hazeroth[^h2698]; and abode at Hazeroth[^h2698].

###### 1
And when Balaam[^h1109] saw[^h7200] that it pleased[^h5869] [^h2895] the LORD[^h3068] to bless[^h1288] Israel[^h3478], he went[^h1980] not, as at other times[^h6471], to seek[^h7125] for enchantments[^h5173], but he set[^h7896] his face[^h6440] toward the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 2
And Balaam[^h1109] lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], and he saw[^h7200] Israel[^h3478] abiding[^h7931] in his tents according to their tribes[^h7626]; and the spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] came upon him.
###### 3
And he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Balaam[^h1109] the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160] hath said[^h5002], and the man[^h1397] whose eyes[^h5869] are open[^h8365] hath said[^h5002]: 
###### 4
He hath said[^h5002], which heard[^h8085] the words[^h561] of God[^h410], which saw[^h2372] the vision[^h4236] of the Almighty[^h7706], falling[^h5307] into a trance, but having his eyes[^h5869] open[^h1540]:
###### 5
How goodly[^h2895] are thy tents[^h168], O Jacob[^h3290], and thy tabernacles[^h4908], O Israel[^h3478]!
###### 6
As the valleys[^h5158] are they spread forth[^h5186], as gardens[^h1593] by the river's side[^h5104], as the trees of lign aloes[^h174] which the LORD[^h3068] hath planted[^h5193], and as cedar trees[^h730] beside the waters[^h4325].
###### 7
He shall pour[^h5140] the water[^h4325] out[^h5140] of his buckets[^h1805], and his seed[^h2233] shall be in many[^h7227] waters[^h4325], and his king[^h4428] shall be higher[^h7311] than Agag[^h90], and his kingdom[^h4438] shall be exalted[^h5375].
###### 8
God[^h410] brought him forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]; he hath as it were the strength[^h8443] of an unicorn[^h7214]: he shall eat up[^h398] the nations[^h1471] his enemies[^h6862], and shall break[^h1633] their bones[^h6106], and pierce[^h4272] them through with his arrows[^h2671].
###### 9
He couched[^h3766], he lay down[^h7901] as a lion[^h738], and as a great lion[^h3833]: who shall stir him up[^h6965]? Blessed[^h1288] is he that blesseth[^h1288] thee, and cursed[^h779] is he that curseth[^h779] thee.
###### 10
And Balak's[^h1111] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against Balaam[^h1109], and he smote[^h5606] his hands[^h3709] together[^h5606]: and Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], I called[^h7121] thee to curse[^h6895] mine enemies[^h341], and, behold, thou hast altogether[^h1288] blessed[^h1288] them these three[^h7969] times[^h6471].
###### 11
Therefore now flee[^h1272] thou to thy place[^h4725]: I thought[^h559] to promote[^h3513] thee unto great[^h3513] honour[^h3513]; but, lo, the LORD[^h3068] hath kept thee back[^h4513] from honour[^h3519].
###### 12
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Spake[^h1696] I not also to thy messengers[^h4397] which thou sentest[^h7971] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 13
If Balak[^h1111] would give[^h5414] me his house[^h1004] full[^h4393] of silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], I cannot[^h3201] go beyond[^h5674] the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], to do[^h6213] either good[^h2896] or bad[^h7451] of mine own mind[^h3820]; but what the LORD[^h3068] saith[^h1696], that will I speak[^h1696]?
###### 14
And now, behold, I go[^h1980] unto my people[^h5971]: come[^h3212] therefore, and I will advertise[^h3289] thee what this people[^h5971] shall do[^h6213] to thy people[^h5971] in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117].
###### 15
And he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Balaam[^h1109] the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160] hath said[^h5002], and the man[^h1397] whose eyes[^h5869] are open[^h8365] hath said[^h5002]:
###### 16
He hath said[^h5002], which heard[^h8085] the words[^h561] of God[^h410], and knew[^h3045] the knowledge[^h1847] of the most High[^h5945], which saw[^h2372] the vision[^h4236] of the Almighty[^h7706], falling[^h5307] into a trance, but having his eyes[^h5869] open[^h1540]:
###### 17
I shall see[^h7200] him, but not now: I shall behold[^h7789] him, but not nigh[^h7138]: there shall come[^h1869] a Star[^h3556] out of Jacob[^h3290], and a Sceptre[^h7626] shall rise[^h6965] out of Israel[^h3478], and shall smite[^h4272] the corners[^h6285] of Moab[^h4124], and destroy[^h6979] all the children[^h1121] of Sheth[^h8352] [^h8351]. 
###### 18
And Edom[^h123] shall be a possession[^h3424], Seir[^h8165] also shall be a possession[^h3424] for his enemies[^h341]; and Israel[^h3478] shall do[^h6213] valiantly[^h2428].
###### 19
Out of Jacob[^h3290] shall come he that shall have dominion[^h7287], and shall destroy[^h6] him that remaineth[^h8300] of the city[^h5892].
###### 20
And when he looked[^h7200] on Amalek[^h6002], he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Amalek[^h6002] was the first[^h7225] of the nations[^h1471]; but his latter[^h319] end shall be that he perish[^h8] for ever[^h5703].  
###### 21
And he looked[^h7200] on the Kenites[^h7017], and took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Strong[^h386] is thy dwellingplace[^h4186], and thou puttest[^h7760] thy nest[^h7064] in a rock[^h5553].
###### 22
Nevertheless the Kenite[^h7014] shall[^h518] be wasted[^h1197], until Asshur[^h804] shall carry thee away captive[^h7617].  
###### 23
And he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Alas[^h188], who shall live[^h2421] when God[^h410] doeth[^h7760] this!
###### 24
And ships[^h6716] shall come from the coast[^h3027] of Chittim[^h3794], and shall afflict[^h6031] Asshur[^h804], and shall afflict[^h6031] Eber[^h5677], and he also shall perish[^h8] for ever[^h5703].
###### 25
And Balaam[^h1109] rose up[^h6965], and went[^h3212] and returned[^h7725] to his place[^h4725]: and Balak[^h1111] also went[^h1980] his way[^h1870].

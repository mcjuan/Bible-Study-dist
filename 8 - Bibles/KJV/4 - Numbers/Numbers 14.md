###### 1
And all the congregation[^h5712] lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963], and cried[^h5414]; and the people[^h5971] wept[^h1058] that night[^h3915].
###### 2
And all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] murmured[^h3885] against Moses[^h4872] and against Aaron[^h175]: and the whole congregation[^h5712] said[^h559] unto them, Would God[^h3863] that we had died[^h4191] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]! or would God[^h3863] we had died[^h4191] in this wilderness[^h4057]!
###### 3
And wherefore hath the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h935] us unto this land[^h776], to fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], that our wives[^h802] and our children[^h2945] should be a prey[^h957]? were it not better[^h2896] for us to return[^h7725] into Egypt[^h4714]?
###### 4
And they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], Let us make[^h5414] a captain[^h7218], and let us return[^h7725] into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
Then Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] fell[^h5307] on their faces[^h6440] before[^h6440] all the assembly[^h6951] of the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
And Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], and Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312], which were of them that searched[^h8446] the land[^h776], rent[^h7167] their clothes[^h899]:
###### 7
And they spake[^h559] unto all the company[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], The land[^h776], which we passed[^h5674] through to search[^h8446] it, is an exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] good[^h2896] land[^h776].
###### 8
If the LORD[^h3068] delight[^h2654] in us, then he will bring[^h935] us into this land[^h776], and give[^h5414] it us; a land[^h776] which floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706].
###### 9
Only rebel[^h4775] not ye against the LORD[^h3068], neither fear[^h3372] ye the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776]; for they are bread[^h3899] for us: their defence[^h6738] is departed[^h5493] from them, and the LORD[^h3068] is with us: fear[^h3372] them not. 
###### 10
But all the congregation[^h5712] bade[^h559] stone[^h7275] them with stones[^h68]. And the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] before all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], How long will this people[^h5971] provoke[^h5006] me? and how long will it be ere[^h3808] they believe[^h539] me, for all the signs[^h226] which I have shewed[^h6213] among[^h7130] them?
###### 12
I will smite[^h5221] them with the pestilence[^h1698], and disinherit[^h3423] them, and will make[^h6213] of thee a greater[^h1419] nation[^h1471] and mightier[^h6099] than they.
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], Then the Egyptians[^h4714] shall hear[^h8085] it, (for thou broughtest up[^h5927] this people[^h5971] in thy might[^h3581] from among[^h7130] them;)
###### 14
And they will tell[^h559] it to the inhabitants[^h3427] of this land[^h776]: for they have heard[^h8085] that thou LORD[^h3068] art among[^h7130] this people[^h5971], that thou LORD[^h3068] art seen[^h7200] face[^h5869] to face[^h5869], and that thy cloud[^h6051] standeth[^h5975] over them, and that thou goest[^h1980] before[^h6440] them, by day time[^h3119] in a pillar[^h5982] of a cloud[^h6051], and in a pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784] by night[^h3915].
###### 15
Now if thou shalt kill[^h4191] all this people[^h5971] as one[^h259] man[^h376], then the nations[^h1471] which have heard[^h8085] the fame[^h8088] of thee will speak[^h559], saying[^h559],
###### 16
Because the LORD[^h3068] was not[^h1115] able[^h3201] to bring[^h935] this people[^h5971] into the land[^h776] which he sware[^h7650] unto them, therefore he hath slain[^h7819] them in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 17
And now, I beseech thee, let the power[^h3581] of my Lord[^h136] be great[^h1431], according[^h834] as thou hast spoken[^h1696], saying[^h559],
###### 18
The LORD[^h3068] is longsuffering[^h750] [^h639], and of great[^h7227] mercy[^h2617], forgiving[^h5375] iniquity[^h5771] and transgression[^h6588], and by no means[^h5352] clearing[^h5352] the guilty, visiting[^h6485] the iniquity[^h5771] of the fathers[^h1] upon the children[^h1121] unto the third[^h8029] and fourth[^h7256] generation.
###### 19
Pardon[^h5545], I beseech thee, the iniquity[^h5771] of this people[^h5971] according unto the greatness[^h1433] of thy mercy[^h2617], and as thou hast forgiven[^h5375] this people[^h5971], from Egypt[^h4714] even until now[^h2008]. 
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], I have pardoned[^h5545] according to thy word[^h1697]:
###### 21
But as truly[^h199] as I live[^h2416], all the earth[^h776] shall be filled[^h4390] with the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
Because all those men[^h582] which have seen[^h7200] my glory[^h3519], and my miracles[^h226], which I did[^h6213] in Egypt[^h4714] and in the wilderness[^h4057], and have tempted[^h5254] [^h853] me now these ten[^h6235] times[^h6471], and have not hearkened[^h8085] to my voice[^h6963];
###### 23
Surely they shall not[^h518] see[^h7200] the land[^h776] which I sware[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1], neither shall any of them that provoked[^h5006] me see[^h7200] it: 
###### 24
But my servant[^h5650] Caleb[^h3612], because[^h6118] he had another[^h312] spirit[^h7307] with him, and hath followed[^h310] me fully[^h4390], him will I bring[^h935] into the land[^h776] whereinto he went[^h935]; and his seed[^h2233] shall possess[^h3423] it.
###### 25
(Now the Amalekites[^h6003] and the Canaanites[^h3669] dwelt[^h3427] in the valley[^h6010].) To morrow[^h4279] turn[^h6437] you, and get[^h5265] you into the wilderness[^h4057] by the way[^h1870] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 26
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] and unto Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559],
###### 27
How long shall I bear with this evil[^h7451] congregation[^h5712], which murmur[^h3885] against me? I have heard[^h8085] the murmurings[^h8519] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which they murmur[^h3885] against me.
###### 28
Say[^h559] unto them, As truly as [^h3808] I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], as ye have spoken[^h1696] in mine ears[^h241], so will I do[^h6213] to you:
###### 29
Your carcases[^h6297] shall fall[^h5307] in this wilderness[^h4057]; and all that were numbered[^h6485] of you, according to your whole number[^h4557], from twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and upward[^h4605], which have murmured[^h3885] against me,
###### 30
Doubtless ye shall not[^h518] come[^h935] into the land[^h776], concerning which I sware[^h3027] [^h5375] to make you dwell[^h7931] therein, save Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312], and Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126]. 
###### 31
But your little ones[^h2945], which ye said[^h559] should be a prey[^h957], them will I bring in[^h935], and they shall know[^h3045] the land[^h776] which ye have despised[^h3988].
###### 32
But as for you, your carcases[^h6297], they shall fall[^h5307] in this wilderness[^h4057].
###### 33
And your children[^h1121] shall wander[^h7462] in the wilderness[^h4057] forty[^h705] years[^h8141], and bear[^h5375] your whoredoms[^h2184], until your carcases[^h6297] be wasted[^h8552] in the wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 34
After the number[^h4557] of the days[^h3117] in which ye searched[^h8446] the land[^h776], even forty[^h705] days[^h3117], each day[^h3117] for a year[^h8141] [^h3117] [^h8141], shall ye bear[^h5375] your iniquities[^h5771], even forty[^h705] years[^h8141], and ye shall know[^h3045] my breach of promise[^h8569]. 
###### 35
I the LORD[^h3068] have said[^h1696], I will surely[^h518] [^h3808] do[^h6213] it[^h2063] unto all this evil[^h7451] congregation[^h5712], that are gathered together[^h3259] against me: in this wilderness[^h4057] they shall be consumed[^h8552], and there they shall die[^h4191].
###### 36
And the men[^h582], which Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] to search[^h8446] the land[^h776], who returned[^h7725], and made all the congregation[^h5712] to murmur[^h3885] [^h3885] against him, by bringing up[^h3318] a slander[^h1681] upon the land[^h776],
###### 37
Even those[^h582] men[^h582] that did bring up[^h3318] the evil[^h7451] report[^h1681] upon the land[^h776], died[^h4191] by the plague[^h4046] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 38
But Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], and Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312], which were of the men[^h1992] [^h582] that went[^h1980] to search[^h8446] the land[^h776], lived[^h2421] still.
###### 39
And Moses[^h4872] told[^h1696] these sayings[^h1697] unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and the people[^h5971] mourned[^h56] greatly[^h3966].
###### 40
And they rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and gat them up[^h5927] into the top[^h7218] of the mountain[^h2022], saying[^h559], Lo[^h2009], we be here, and will go up[^h5927] unto the place[^h4725] which the LORD[^h3068] hath promised[^h559]: for we have sinned[^h2398].
###### 41
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Wherefore now do ye transgress[^h5674] the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068]? but it shall not prosper[^h6743].
###### 42
Go not up[^h5927], for the LORD[^h3068] is not among[^h7130] you; that ye be not smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] your enemies[^h341].
###### 43
For the Amalekites[^h6003] and the Canaanites[^h3669] are there before[^h6440] you, and ye shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]: because ye are turned[^h7725] away[^h310] from the LORD[^h3068], therefore the LORD[^h3068] will not be with you.
###### 44
But they presumed[^h6075] to go up[^h5927] unto the hill[^h2022] top[^h7218]: nevertheless the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and Moses[^h4872], departed[^h4185] not out[^h7130] of the camp[^h4264].
###### 45
Then the Amalekites[^h6003] came down[^h3381], and the Canaanites[^h3669] which dwelt[^h3427] in that hill[^h2022], and smote[^h5221] them, and discomfited[^h3807] them, even unto Hormah[^h2767].

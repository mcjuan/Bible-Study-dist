And if they be married[^h802] to any[^h259] of the sons[^h1121] of the other tribes[^h7626] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], then shall their inheritance[^h5159] be taken[^h1639] from the inheritance[^h5159] of our fathers[^h1], and shall be put[^h3254] to the inheritance[^h5159] of the tribe[^h4294] whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken[^h1639] from the lot[^h1486] of our inheritance[^h5159].

###### 5
And Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] according to the word[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], The tribe[^h4294] of the sons[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] hath said[^h1696] well.

This is the thing[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] doth command[^h6680] concerning the daughters[^h1323] of Zelophehad[^h6765], saying[^h559], Let them marry[^h802] to whom they think[^h5869] best[^h2896]; only to the family[^h4940] of the tribe[^h4294] of their father[^h1] shall they marry[^h802]. 
###### 7
So shall not the inheritance[^h5159] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] remove[^h5437] from tribe[^h4294] to tribe[^h4294]: for every one[^h376] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall keep[^h1692] himself to the inheritance[^h5159] of the tribe[^h4294] of his fathers[^h1].

###### 9
Neither shall the inheritance[^h5159] remove[^h5437] from one tribe[^h4294] to another[^h312] tribe[^h4294]; but every one[^h376] of the tribes[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall keep[^h1692] himself to his own inheritance[^h5159].
###### 10

Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye are passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667];
###### 52
Then ye shall drive out[^h3423] all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] from before[^h6440] you, and destroy[^h6] all their pictures[^h4906], and destroy[^h6] all their molten[^h4541] images[^h6754], and quite pluck down[^h8045] all their high places[^h1116]:
###### 53
And ye shall dispossess[^h3423] the inhabitants of the land[^h776], and dwell[^h3427] therein: for I have given[^h5414] you the land[^h776] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 54
And ye shall divide[^h5157] the land[^h776] by lot[^h1486] for an inheritance[^h5157] among your families[^h4940]: and to the more[^h7227] ye shall give the more[^h7235] inheritance[^h5159], and to the fewer[^h4592] ye shall give the less[^h4591] inheritance[^h5159]: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot[^h1486] falleth[^h3318]; according to the tribes[^h4294] of your fathers[^h1] ye shall inherit[^h5157].

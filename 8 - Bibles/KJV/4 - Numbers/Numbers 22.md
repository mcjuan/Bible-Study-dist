###### 1
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] set forward[^h5265], and pitched[^h2583] in the plains[^h6160] of Moab[^h4124] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] by Jericho[^h3405].
###### 2
And Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834] saw[^h7200] all that Israel[^h3478] had done[^h6213] to the Amorites[^h567].
###### 3
And Moab[^h4124] was sore[^h3966] afraid[^h1481] of[^h6440] the people[^h5971], because they were many[^h7227]: and Moab[^h4124] was distressed[^h6973] because of[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
And Moab[^h4124] said[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205] of Midian[^h4080], Now shall this company[^h6951] lick up[^h3897] all that are round about[^h5439] us, as the ox[^h7794] licketh up[^h3897] the grass[^h3418] of the field[^h7704]. And Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834] was king[^h4428] of the Moabites[^h4124] at that time[^h6256].
###### 5
He sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] therefore unto Balaam[^h1109] the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160] to Pethor[^h6604], which is by the river[^h5104] of the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of his people[^h5971], to call[^h7121] him, saying[^h559], Behold, there is a people[^h5971] come out[^h3318] from Egypt[^h4714]: behold, they cover[^h3680] the face[^h5869] of the earth[^h776], and they abide[^h3427] over against[^h4136] me: 
###### 6
Come[^h3212] now therefore, I pray thee, curse[^h779] me this people[^h5971]; for they are too mighty[^h6099] for me: peradventure I shall prevail[^h3201], that we may smite[^h5221] them, and that I may drive them out[^h1644] of the land[^h776]: for I wot[^h3045] that he whom thou blessest[^h1288] is blessed[^h1288], and he whom thou cursest[^h779] is cursed[^h779].
###### 7
And the elders[^h2205] of Moab[^h4124] and the elders[^h2205] of Midian[^h4080] departed[^h3212] with the rewards of divination[^h7081] in their hand[^h3027]; and they came[^h935] unto Balaam[^h1109], and spake[^h1696] unto him the words[^h1697] of Balak[^h1111].
###### 8
And he said[^h559] unto them, Lodge[^h3885] here this night[^h3915], and I will bring[^h7725] you word[^h1697] again[^h7725], as the LORD[^h3068] shall speak[^h1696] unto me: and the princes[^h8269] of Moab[^h4124] abode[^h3427] with Balaam[^h1109].
###### 9
And God[^h430] came[^h935] unto Balaam[^h1109], and said[^h559], What men[^h582] are these with thee?
###### 10
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834], king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], hath sent[^h7971] unto me, saying,
###### 11
Behold, there is a people[^h5971] come out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714], which covereth[^h3680] the face[^h5869] of the earth[^h776]: come[^h3212] now, curse[^h6895] me them; peradventure I shall be able[^h3201] to overcome[^h3898] them, and drive them out[^h1644]. 
###### 12
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Thou shalt not go[^h3212] with them; thou shalt not curse[^h779] the people[^h5971]: for they are blessed[^h1288].
###### 13
And Balaam[^h1109] rose up[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242], and said[^h559] unto the princes[^h8269] of Balak[^h1111], Get[^h3212] you into your land[^h776]: for the LORD[^h3068] refuseth[^h3985] to give me leave[^h5414] to go[^h1980] with you.
###### 14
And the princes[^h8269] of Moab[^h4124] rose up[^h6965], and they went[^h935] unto Balak[^h1111], and said[^h559], Balaam[^h1109] refuseth[^h3985] to come[^h1980] with us.
###### 15
And Balak[^h1111] sent[^h7971] yet again[^h3254] princes[^h8269], more[^h7227], and more honourable[^h3513] than they.
###### 16
And they came[^h935] to Balaam[^h1109], and said[^h559] to him, Thus saith[^h559] Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834], Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder[^h4513] thee from coming[^h1980] unto me: 
###### 17
For I will promote[^h3513] thee unto very[^h3966] great[^h3513] honour[^h3513], and I will do[^h6213] whatsoever thou sayest[^h559] unto me: come[^h3212] therefore, I pray thee, curse[^h6895] me this people[^h5971].
###### 18
And Balaam[^h1109] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto the servants[^h5650] of Balak[^h1111], If Balak[^h1111] would give[^h5414] me his house[^h1004] full[^h4393] of silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], I cannot[^h3201] go beyond[^h5674] the word[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], to do[^h6213] less[^h6996] or more[^h1419].
###### 19
Now therefore, I pray you, tarry[^h3427] ye also here this night[^h3915], that I may know[^h3045] what the LORD[^h3068] will say[^h1696] unto me more[^h3254].
###### 20
And God[^h430] came[^h935] unto Balaam[^h1109] at night[^h3915], and said[^h559] unto him, If the men[^h582] come[^h935] to call[^h7121] thee, rise up[^h6965], and go[^h3212] with them; but yet[^h389] the word[^h1697] which I shall say[^h1696] unto thee, that shalt thou do[^h6213].
###### 21
And Balaam[^h1109] rose up[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242], and saddled[^h2280] his ass[^h860], and went[^h3212] with the princes[^h8269] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 22
And God's[^h430] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] because he went[^h1980]: and the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h3320] in the way[^h1870] for an adversary[^h7854] against him. Now he was riding[^h7392] upon his ass[^h860], and his two[^h8147] servants[^h5288] were with him.
###### 23
And the ass[^h860] saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] standing[^h5324] in the way[^h1870], and his sword[^h2719] drawn[^h8025] in his hand[^h3027]: and the ass[^h860] turned aside[^h5186] out of the way[^h1870], and went[^h3212] into the field[^h7704]: and Balaam[^h1109] smote[^h5221] the ass[^h860], to turn[^h5186] her into the way[^h1870].
###### 24
But the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h5975] in a path[^h4934] of the vineyards[^h3754], a wall[^h1447] being on this side, and a wall[^h1447] on that side.
###### 25
And when the ass[^h860] saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], she thrust[^h3905] herself unto the wall[^h7023], and crushed[^h3905] Balaam's[^h1109] foot[^h7272] against the wall[^h7023]: and he smote[^h5221] her again[^h3254].
###### 26
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] went[^h5674] further[^h3254], and stood[^h5975] in a narrow[^h6862] place[^h4725], where was no way[^h1870] to turn[^h5186] either to the right hand[^h3225] or to the left[^h8040].
###### 27
And when the ass[^h860] saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], she fell down[^h7257] under Balaam[^h1109]: and Balaam's[^h1109] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734], and he smote[^h5221] the ass[^h860] with a staff[^h4731].
###### 28
And the LORD[^h3068] opened[^h6605] the mouth[^h6310] of the ass[^h860], and she said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], What have I done[^h6213] unto thee, that thou hast smitten[^h5221] me these three[^h7969] times[^h7272]?
###### 29
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto the ass[^h860], Because thou hast mocked[^h5953] me: I would[^h3863] there were[^h3426] a sword[^h2719] in mine hand[^h3027], for now would I kill[^h2026] thee.
###### 30
And the ass[^h860] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Am not I thine ass[^h860], upon which thou hast ridden[^h7392] ever since I was thine unto this day[^h3117]? was I ever[^h5532] wont[^h5532] to do so[^h6213] unto thee? And he said[^h559], Nay.  
###### 31
Then the LORD[^h3068] opened[^h1540] the eyes[^h5869] of Balaam[^h1109], and he saw[^h7200] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] standing[^h5324] in the way[^h1870], and his sword[^h2719] drawn[^h8025] in his hand[^h3027]: and he bowed down[^h6915] his head, and fell flat[^h7812] on his face[^h639]. 
###### 32
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten[^h5221] thine ass[^h860] these three[^h7969] times[^h7272]? behold, I went out[^h3318] to withstand[^h7854] thee, because thy way[^h1870] is perverse[^h3399] before me: 
###### 33
And the ass[^h860] saw[^h7200] me, and turned[^h5186] from me[^h6440] these three[^h7969] times[^h7272]: unless[^h194] she had turned[^h5186] from me[^h6440], surely now also I had slain[^h2026] thee, and saved her alive[^h2421].
###### 34
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], I have sinned[^h2398]; for I knew[^h3045] not that thou stoodest[^h5324] in the way[^h1870] against[^h7125] me: now therefore, if it displease thee[^h7489] [^h5869], I will get me back again[^h7725]. 
###### 35
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Go[^h3212] with the men[^h582]: but only[^h657] the word[^h1697] that I shall speak[^h1696] unto thee, that thou shalt speak[^h1696]. So Balaam[^h1109] went[^h3212] with the princes[^h8269] of Balak[^h1111].
###### 36
And when Balak[^h1111] heard[^h8085] that Balaam[^h1109] was come[^h935], he went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him unto a city[^h5892] of Moab[^h4124], which is in the border[^h1366] of Arnon[^h769], which is in the utmost[^h7097] coast[^h1366].
###### 37
And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Did I not earnestly[^h7971] send[^h7971] unto thee to call[^h7121] thee? wherefore camest[^h1980] thou not unto me? am I not able[^h3201] indeed[^h552] to promote thee to honour[^h3513]?
###### 38
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Lo, I am come[^h935] unto thee: have I now any power[^h3201] at all[^h3201] to say[^h1696] any thing[^h3972]? the word[^h1697] that God[^h430] putteth[^h7760] in my mouth[^h6310], that shall I speak[^h1696].
###### 39
And Balaam[^h1109] went[^h3212] with Balak[^h1111], and they came[^h935] unto Kirjathhuzoth[^h2351] [^h7155]. 
###### 40
And Balak[^h1111] offered[^h2076] oxen[^h1241] and sheep[^h6629], and sent[^h7971] to Balaam[^h1109], and to the princes[^h8269] that were with him.
###### 41
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h1242], that Balak[^h1111] took[^h3947] Balaam[^h1109], and brought him up[^h5927] into the high places[^h1116] of Baal[^h1120], that thence he might see[^h7200] the utmost[^h7097] part of the people[^h5971].

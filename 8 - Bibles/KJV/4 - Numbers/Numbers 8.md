###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto Aaron[^h175], and say[^h559] unto him, When thou lightest[^h5927] the lamps[^h5216], the seven[^h7651] lamps[^h5216] shall give light[^h215] over against[^h6440] [^h4136] the candlestick[^h4501].
###### 3
And Aaron[^h175] did[^h6213] so; he lighted[^h5927] the lamps[^h5216] thereof over against[^h4136] [^h6440] the candlestick[^h4501], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 4
And this work[^h4639] of the candlestick[^h4501] was of beaten[^h4749] gold[^h2091], unto the shaft[^h3409] thereof, unto the flowers[^h6525] thereof, was beaten work[^h4749]: according unto the pattern[^h4758] which the LORD[^h3068] had shewed[^h7200] Moses[^h4872], so he made[^h6213] the candlestick[^h4501].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 6
Take[^h3947] the Levites[^h3881] from among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and cleanse[^h2891] them.
###### 7
And thus shalt thou do[^h6213] unto them, to cleanse[^h2891] them: Sprinkle[^h5137] water[^h4325] of purifying[^h2403] upon them, and let them shave[^h8593] [^h5674] all their flesh[^h1320], and let them wash[^h3526] their clothes[^h899], and so make themselves clean[^h2891]. 
###### 8
Then let them take[^h3947] a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] with his meat offering[^h4503], even fine flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with oil[^h8081], and another[^h8145] young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] shalt thou take[^h3947] for a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 9
And thou shalt bring[^h7126] the Levites[^h3881] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and thou shalt gather[^h6950] the whole assembly[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] together[^h6950]:
###### 10
And thou shalt bring[^h7126] the Levites[^h3881] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall put[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon the Levites[^h3881]:
###### 11
And Aaron[^h175] shall offer[^h5130] the Levites[^h3881] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] for an offering[^h8573] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they may execute[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the LORD[^h3068].   
###### 12
And the Levites[^h3881] shall lay[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon the heads[^h7218] of the bullocks[^h6499]: and thou shalt offer[^h6213] the one[^h259] for a sin offering[^h2403], and the other[^h259] for a burnt offering[^h5930], unto the LORD[^h3068], to make an atonement[^h3722] for the Levites[^h3881].
###### 13
And thou shalt set[^h5975] the Levites[^h3881] before[^h6440] Aaron[^h175], and before[^h6440] his sons[^h1121], and offer[^h5130] them for an offering[^h8573] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
Thus shalt thou separate[^h914] the Levites[^h3881] from among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and the Levites[^h3881] shall be mine.
###### 15
And after[^h310] that shall the Levites[^h3881] go in[^h935] to do the service[^h5647] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and thou shalt cleanse[^h2891] them, and offer[^h5130] them for an offering[^h8573].
###### 16
For they are wholly given[^h5414] unto me from among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; instead of such as open[^h6363] every womb[^h7358], even instead of the firstborn[^h1060] of all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], have I taken[^h3947] them unto me.
###### 17
For all the firstborn[^h1060] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] are mine, both man[^h120] and beast[^h929]: on the day[^h3117] that I smote[^h5221] every firstborn[^h1060] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] I sanctified[^h6942] them for myself.
###### 18
And I have taken[^h3947] the Levites[^h3881] for all the firstborn[^h1060] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 19
And I have given[^h5414] the Levites[^h3881] as a gift[^h5414] to Aaron[^h175] and to his sons[^h1121] from among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], to do[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and to make an atonement[^h3722] for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: that there be no plague[^h5063] among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] come nigh[^h5066] unto the sanctuary[^h6944]. 
###### 20
And Moses[^h4872], and Aaron[^h175], and all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], did[^h6213] to the Levites[^h3881] according unto all that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] concerning the Levites[^h3881], so did[^h6213] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] unto them.
###### 21
And the Levites[^h3881] were purified[^h2398], and they washed[^h3526] their clothes[^h899]; and Aaron[^h175] offered[^h5130] them as an offering[^h8573] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and Aaron[^h175] made an atonement[^h3722] for them to cleanse[^h2891] them.
###### 22
And after[^h310] that went[^h935] the Levites[^h3881] in to do[^h5647] their service[^h5656] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] before[^h6440] Aaron[^h175], and before[^h6440] his sons[^h1121]: as the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] concerning the Levites[^h3881], so did[^h6213] they unto them.
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 24
This is it that belongeth unto the Levites[^h3881]: from twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] and upward[^h4605] they shall go in[^h935] to wait[^h6633] [^h6635] upon the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: 
###### 25
And from the age[^h1121] of fifty[^h2572] years[^h8141] they shall cease[^h7725] waiting[^h6635] upon the service[^h5656] thereof, and shall serve[^h5647] no more: 
###### 26
But shall minister[^h8334] with their brethren[^h251] in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], to keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931], and shall do[^h5647] no service[^h5656]. Thus shalt thou do[^h6213] unto the Levites[^h3881] touching their charge[^h4931].

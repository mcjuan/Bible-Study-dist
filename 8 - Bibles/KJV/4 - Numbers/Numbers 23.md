###### 1
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Build[^h1129] me here seven[^h7651] altars[^h4196], and prepare[^h3559] me here seven[^h7651] oxen[^h6499] and seven[^h7651] rams[^h352].
###### 2
And Balak[^h1111] did[^h6213] as Balaam[^h1109] had spoken[^h1696]; and Balak[^h1111] and Balaam[^h1109] offered[^h5927] on every altar[^h4196] a bullock[^h6499] and a ram[^h352].
###### 3
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Stand[^h3320] by thy burnt offering[^h5930], and I will go[^h3212]: peradventure the LORD[^h3068] will come[^h7136] to meet[^h7125] me: and whatsoever[^h1697] he sheweth[^h7200] me I will tell[^h5046] thee. And he went[^h3212] to an high place[^h8205]. 
###### 4
And God[^h430] met[^h7136] Balaam[^h1109]: and he said[^h559] unto him, I have prepared[^h6186] seven[^h7651] altars[^h4196], and I have offered[^h5927] upon every altar[^h4196] a bullock[^h6499] and a ram[^h352].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] put[^h7760] a word[^h1697] in Balaam's[^h1109] mouth[^h6310], and said[^h559], Return[^h7725] unto Balak[^h1111], and thus thou shalt speak[^h1696].
###### 6
And he returned[^h7725] unto him, and, lo, he stood[^h5324] by his burnt sacrifice[^h5930], he, and all the princes[^h8269] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 7
And he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Balak[^h1111] the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] hath brought[^h5148] me from Aram[^h758], out of the mountains[^h2042] of the east[^h6924], saying, Come[^h3212], curse[^h779] me Jacob[^h3290], and come[^h3212], defy[^h2194] Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
How[^h4100] shall I curse[^h5344], whom God[^h410] hath not cursed[^h6895]? or how shall I defy[^h2194], whom the LORD[^h3068] hath not defied[^h2194]?
###### 9
For from the top[^h7218] of the rocks[^h6697] I see[^h7200] him, and from the hills[^h1389] I behold[^h7789] him: lo, the people[^h5971] shall dwell[^h7931] alone[^h910], and shall not be reckoned[^h2803] among the nations[^h1471].
###### 10
Who can count[^h4487] the dust[^h6083] of Jacob[^h3290], and the number[^h4557] of the fourth[^h7255] part of Israel[^h3478]? Let me die[^h4191] [^h5315] the death[^h4194] of the righteous[^h3477], and let my last[^h319] end be like his! 
###### 11
And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], What hast thou done[^h6213] unto me? I took[^h3947] thee to curse[^h6895] mine enemies[^h341], and, behold, thou hast blessed[^h1288] them altogether[^h1288].
###### 12
And he answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Must I not take heed[^h8104] to speak[^h1696] that which the LORD[^h3068] hath put[^h7760] in my mouth[^h6310]?
###### 13
And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto him, Come[^h3212], I pray thee, with me unto another[^h312] place[^h4725], from whence thou mayest see[^h7200] them: thou shalt see[^h7200] but[^h657] the utmost[^h7097] part of them, and shalt not see[^h7200] them all: and curse[^h6895] me them from thence.
###### 14
And he brought[^h3947] him into the field[^h7704] of Zophim[^h6839] [^h6822], to the top[^h7218] of Pisgah[^h6449], and built[^h1129] seven[^h7651] altars[^h4196], and offered[^h5927] a bullock[^h6499] and a ram[^h352] on every altar[^h4196]. 
###### 15
And he said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Stand[^h3320] here[^h3541] by thy burnt offering[^h5930], while I meet[^h7136] the LORD yonder[^h3541].
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] met[^h7136] Balaam[^h1109], and put[^h7760] a word[^h1697] in his mouth[^h6310], and said[^h559], Go again[^h7725] unto Balak[^h1111], and say[^h1696] thus.
###### 17
And when he came[^h935] to him, behold, he stood[^h5324] by his burnt offering[^h5930], and the princes[^h8269] of Moab[^h4124] with him. And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto him, What hath the LORD[^h3068] spoken[^h1696]?
###### 18
And he took up[^h5375] his parable[^h4912], and said[^h559], Rise up[^h6965], Balak[^h1111], and hear[^h8085]; hearken[^h238] unto me, thou son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834]:
###### 19
God[^h410] is not a man[^h376], that he should lie[^h3576]; neither the son[^h1121] of man[^h120], that he should repent[^h5162]: hath he said[^h559], and shall he not do[^h6213] it? or hath he spoken[^h1696], and shall he not make it good[^h6965]?
###### 20
Behold, I have received[^h3947] commandment to bless[^h1288]: and he hath blessed[^h1288]; and I cannot reverse[^h7725] it.
###### 21
He hath not beheld[^h5027] iniquity[^h205] in Jacob[^h3290], neither hath he seen[^h7200] perverseness[^h5999] in Israel[^h3478]: the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] is with him, and the shout[^h8643] of a king[^h4428] is among them.
###### 22
God[^h410] brought them out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714]; he hath as it were the strength[^h8443] of an unicorn[^h7214].
###### 23
Surely there is no enchantment[^h5173] against Jacob[^h3290], neither is there any divination[^h7081] against Israel[^h3478]: according to this time[^h6256] it shall be said[^h559] of Jacob[^h3290] and of Israel[^h3478], What hath God[^h410] wrought[^h6466]! 
###### 24
Behold, the people[^h5971] shall rise up[^h6965] as a great lion[^h3833], and lift up[^h5375] himself as a young lion[^h738]: he shall not lie down[^h7901] until he eat[^h398] of the prey[^h2964], and drink[^h8354] the blood[^h1818] of the slain[^h2491].
###### 25
And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Neither curse[^h5344] them at all[^h6895], nor bless[^h1288] them at all[^h1288].
###### 26
But Balaam[^h1109] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Told[^h1696] not I thee, saying[^h559], All that the LORD[^h3068] speaketh[^h1696], that I must do[^h6213]?
###### 27
And Balak[^h1111] said[^h559] unto Balaam[^h1109], Come[^h3212], I pray thee, I will bring[^h3947] thee unto another[^h312] place[^h4725]; peradventure it will please[^h3474] [^h5869] God[^h430] that thou mayest curse[^h6895] me them from thence.
###### 28
And Balak[^h1111] brought[^h3947] Balaam[^h1109] unto the top[^h7218] of Peor[^h6465], that looketh[^h8259] toward[^h6440] Jeshimon[^h3452].
###### 29
And Balaam[^h1109] said[^h559] unto Balak[^h1111], Build[^h1129] me here seven[^h7651] altars[^h4196], and prepare[^h3559] me here seven[^h7651] bullocks[^h6499] and seven[^h7651] rams[^h352].
###### 30
And Balak[^h1111] did[^h6213] as Balaam[^h1109] had said[^h559], and offered[^h5927] a bullock[^h6499] and a ram[^h352] on every altar[^h4196].

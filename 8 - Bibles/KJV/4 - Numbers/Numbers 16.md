###### 1
Now Korah[^h7141], the son[^h1121] of Izhar[^h3324], the son[^h1121] of Kohath[^h6955], the son[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], and Dathan[^h1885] and Abiram[^h48], the sons[^h1121] of Eliab[^h446], and On[^h203], the son[^h1121] of Peleth[^h6431], sons[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], took[^h3947] men:
###### 2
And they rose up[^h6965] before[^h6440] Moses[^h4872], with certain[^h582] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], two hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] princes[^h5387] of the assembly[^h5712], famous[^h7148] in the congregation[^h4150], men[^h582] of renown[^h8034]:
###### 3
And they gathered themselves together[^h6950] against Moses[^h4872] and against Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559] unto them, Ye take too much[^h7227] upon you, seeing all the congregation[^h5712] are holy[^h6918], every one of them, and the LORD[^h3068] is among[^h8432] them: wherefore then lift ye up[^h5375] yourselves above the congregation[^h6951] of the LORD[^h3068]? 
###### 4
And when Moses[^h4872] heard[^h8085] it, he fell[^h5307] upon his face[^h6440]:
###### 5
And he spake[^h1696] unto Korah[^h7141] and unto all his company[^h5712], saying[^h559], Even to morrow[^h1242] the LORD[^h3068] will shew[^h3045] who are his, and who is holy[^h6918]; and will cause him to come near[^h7126] unto him: even him whom he hath chosen[^h977] will he cause to come near[^h7126] unto him.
###### 6
This do[^h6213]; Take[^h3947] you censers[^h4289], Korah[^h7141], and all his company[^h5712];
###### 7
And put[^h5414] fire[^h784] therein[^h2004], and put[^h7760] incense[^h7004] in them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] to morrow[^h4279]: and it shall be that the man[^h376] whom the LORD[^h3068] doth choose[^h977], he shall be holy[^h6918]: ye take too much[^h7227] upon you, ye sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878].
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Korah[^h7141], Hear[^h8085], I pray you, ye sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878]:
###### 9
Seemeth it but a small thing[^h4592] unto you, that the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] hath separated[^h914] you from the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478], to bring you near[^h7126] to himself to do[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068], and to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the congregation[^h5712] to minister[^h8334] unto them?
###### 10
And he hath brought thee near[^h7126] to him, and all thy brethren[^h251] the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] with thee: and seek[^h1245] ye the priesthood[^h3550] also?
###### 11
For which cause[^h3651] both thou and all thy company[^h5712] are gathered together[^h3259] against the LORD[^h3068]: and what is Aaron[^h175], that ye murmur[^h3885] [^h3885] against him?
###### 12
And Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] to call[^h7121] Dathan[^h1885] and Abiram[^h48], the sons[^h1121] of Eliab[^h446]: which said[^h559], We will not come up[^h5927]:
###### 13
Is it a small thing[^h4592] that[^h3588] thou hast brought us up[^h5927] out of a land[^h776] that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], to kill[^h4191] us in the wilderness[^h4057], except thou make[^h8323] thyself altogether[^h8323] a prince[^h8323] over us?
###### 14
Moreover[^h637] thou hast not brought[^h935] us into a land[^h776] that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], or given[^h5414] us inheritance[^h5159] of fields[^h7704] and vineyards[^h3754]: wilt thou put out[^h5365] the eyes[^h5869] of these men[^h582]? we will not come up[^h5927]. 
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] was very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734], and said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], Respect[^h6437] not thou their offering[^h4503]: I have not taken[^h5375] one[^h259] ass[^h2543] from them, neither have I hurt[^h7489] one[^h259] of them.
###### 16
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Korah[^h7141], Be thou and all thy company[^h5712] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], thou, and they, and Aaron[^h175], to morrow[^h4279]:
###### 17
And take[^h3947] every man[^h376] his censer[^h4289], and put[^h5414] incense[^h7004] in them, and bring[^h7126] ye before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] every man[^h376] his censer[^h4289], two hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] censers[^h4289]; thou also, and Aaron[^h175], each[^h376] of you his censer[^h4289].
###### 18
And they took[^h3947] every man[^h376] his censer[^h4289], and put[^h5414] fire[^h784] in them, and laid[^h7760] incense[^h7004] thereon, and stood[^h5975] in the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] with Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175].
###### 19
And Korah[^h7141] gathered[^h6950] all the congregation[^h5712] against them unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto all the congregation[^h5712].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] and unto Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559],
###### 21
Separate[^h914] yourselves from among[^h8432] this congregation[^h5712], that I may consume[^h3615] them in a moment[^h7281].
###### 22
And they fell[^h5307] upon their faces[^h6440], and said[^h559], O God[^h410], the God[^h430] of the spirits[^h7307] of all flesh[^h1320], shall one[^h259] man[^h376] sin[^h2398], and wilt thou be wroth[^h7107] with all the congregation[^h5712]?
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 24
Speak[^h1696] unto the congregation[^h5712], saying[^h559], Get you up[^h5927] from about[^h5439] the tabernacle[^h4908] of Korah[^h7141], Dathan[^h1885], and Abiram[^h48].
###### 25
And Moses[^h4872] rose up[^h6965] and went[^h3212] unto Dathan[^h1885] and Abiram[^h48]; and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] followed[^h3212] him[^h310].
###### 26
And he spake[^h1696] unto the congregation[^h5712], saying[^h559], Depart[^h5493], I pray you, from the tents[^h168] of these wicked[^h7563] men[^h582], and touch[^h5060] nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed[^h5595] in all their sins[^h2403].
###### 27
So they gat up[^h5927] from the tabernacle[^h4908] of Korah[^h7141], Dathan[^h1885], and Abiram[^h48], on every side[^h5439]: and Dathan[^h1885] and Abiram[^h48] came out[^h3318], and stood[^h5324] in the door[^h6607] of their tents[^h168], and their wives[^h802], and their sons[^h1121], and their little children[^h2945].
###### 28
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Hereby ye shall know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] me to do[^h6213] all these works[^h4639]; for I have not done them of mine own mind[^h3820].
###### 29
If these men die[^h4191] the common death[^h4194] of all men[^h120], or if they be visited[^h6485] after the visitation[^h6486] of all men[^h120]; then the LORD[^h3068] hath not sent[^h7971] me. 
###### 30
But if the LORD[^h3068] make[^h1254] a new thing[^h1278], and the earth[^h127] open[^h6475] her mouth[^h6310], and swallow them up[^h1104], with all that appertain unto them, and they go down[^h3381] quick[^h2416] into the pit[^h7585]; then ye shall understand[^h3045] that these men[^h582] have provoked[^h5006] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 31
And it came to pass, as he had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] all these words[^h1697], that the ground[^h127] clave asunder[^h1234] that was under them:
###### 32
And the earth[^h776] opened[^h6605] her mouth[^h6310], and swallowed them up[^h1104], and their houses[^h1004], and all the men[^h120] that appertained unto Korah[^h7141], and all their goods[^h7399].
###### 33
They, and all that appertained to them, went down[^h3381] alive[^h2416] into the pit[^h7585], and the earth[^h776] closed[^h3680] upon them: and they perished[^h6] from among[^h8432] the congregation[^h6951].
###### 34
And all Israel[^h3478] that were round about[^h5439] them fled[^h5127] at the cry[^h6963] of them: for they said[^h559], Lest the earth[^h776] swallow us up[^h1104] also.
###### 35
And there came out[^h3318] a fire[^h784] from the LORD[^h3068], and consumed[^h398] the two hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] men[^h376] that offered[^h7126] incense[^h7004].
###### 36
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 37
Speak[^h559] unto Eleazar[^h499] the son[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] the priest[^h3548], that he take up[^h7311] the censers[^h4289] out[^h996] of the burning[^h8316], and scatter[^h2219] thou the fire[^h784] yonder[^h1973]; for they are hallowed[^h6942].
###### 38
The censers[^h4289] of these sinners[^h2400] against their own souls[^h5315], let them make[^h6213] them broad[^h7555] plates[^h6341] for a covering[^h6826] of the altar[^h4196]: for they offered[^h7126] them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], therefore they are hallowed[^h6942]: and they shall be a sign[^h226] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 39
And Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548] took[^h3947] the brasen[^h5178] censers[^h4289], wherewith they that were burnt[^h8313] had offered[^h7126]; and they were made broad[^h7554] plates for a covering[^h6826] of the altar[^h4196]:
###### 40
To be a memorial[^h2146] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that[^h834] [^h4616] no stranger[^h376] [^h2114], which is not of the seed[^h2233] of Aaron[^h175], come near[^h7126] to offer[^h6999] incense[^h7004] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; that he be not as Korah[^h7141], and as his company[^h5712]: as the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] to him by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 41
But on the morrow[^h4283] all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] murmured[^h3885] against Moses[^h4872] and against Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559], Ye have killed[^h4191] the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 42
And it came to pass, when the congregation[^h5712] was gathered[^h6950] against Moses[^h4872] and against Aaron[^h175], that they looked[^h6437] toward the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and, behold, the cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] it, and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200].
###### 43
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] came[^h935] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 44
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 45
Get you up[^h7426] from among[^h8432] this congregation[^h5712], that I may consume[^h3615] them as in a moment[^h7281]. And they fell[^h5307] upon their faces[^h6440].
###### 46
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] a censer[^h4289], and put[^h5414] fire[^h784] therein from off[^h6440] the altar[^h4196], and put[^h7760] on incense[^h7004], and go[^h3212] quickly[^h4120] unto the congregation[^h5712], and make an atonement[^h3722] for them: for there is wrath[^h7110] gone out[^h3318] from the LORD[^h3068]; the plague[^h5063] is begun[^h2490].
###### 47
And Aaron[^h175] took[^h3947] as Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h1696], and ran[^h7323] into the midst[^h8432] of the congregation[^h6951]; and, behold, the plague[^h5063] was begun[^h2490] among the people[^h5971]: and he put[^h5414] on incense[^h7004], and made an atonement[^h3722] for the people[^h5971].
###### 48
And he stood[^h5975] between the dead[^h4191] and the living[^h2416]; and the plague[^h4046] was stayed[^h6113].
###### 49
Now they that died[^h4191] in the plague[^h4046] were fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967], beside them that died[^h4191] about the matter[^h1697] of Korah[^h7141].
###### 50
And Aaron[^h175] returned[^h7725] unto Moses[^h4872] unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and the plague[^h4046] was stayed[^h6113].

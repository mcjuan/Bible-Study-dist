###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] in the plains[^h6160] of Moab[^h4124] by Jordan[^h3383] near Jericho[^h3405], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Command[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they give[^h5414] unto the Levites[^h3881] of the inheritance[^h5159] of their possession[^h272] cities[^h5892] to dwell in[^h3427]; and ye shall give[^h5414] also unto the Levites[^h3881] suburbs[^h4054] for the cities[^h5892] round about[^h5439] them.
###### 3
And the cities[^h5892] shall they have to dwell in[^h3427]; and the suburbs[^h4054] of them shall be for their cattle[^h929], and for their goods[^h7399], and for all their beasts[^h2416].
###### 4
And the suburbs[^h4054] of the cities[^h5892], which ye shall give[^h5414] unto the Levites[^h3881], shall reach from the wall[^h7023] of the city[^h5892] and outward[^h2351] a thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520] round about[^h5439].
###### 5
And ye shall measure[^h4058] from without[^h2351] the city[^h5892] on the east[^h6924] side[^h6285] two thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520], and on the south[^h5045] side[^h6285] two thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520], and on the west[^h3220] side[^h6285] two thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520], and on the north[^h6828] side[^h6285] two thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520]; and the city[^h5892] shall be in the midst[^h8432]: this shall be to them the suburbs[^h4054] of the cities[^h5892].
###### 6
And among the cities[^h5892] which ye shall give[^h5414] unto the Levites[^h3881] there shall be six[^h8337] cities[^h5892] for refuge[^h4733], which ye shall appoint[^h5414] for the manslayer[^h7523], that he may flee[^h5127] thither: and to them ye shall add[^h5414] forty[^h705] and two[^h8147] cities[^h5892]. 
###### 7
So all the cities[^h5892] which ye shall give[^h5414] to the Levites[^h3881] shall be forty[^h705] and eight[^h8083] cities[^h5892]: them shall ye give with their suburbs[^h4054].
###### 8
And the cities[^h5892] which ye shall give[^h5414] shall be of the possession[^h272] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: from them that have many[^h7227] ye shall give many[^h7235]; but from them that have few[^h4592] ye shall give few[^h4591]: every one[^h376] shall give[^h5414] of his cities[^h5892] unto the Levites[^h3881] according[^h6310] to his inheritance[^h5159] which he inheriteth[^h5157]. 
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 10
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, When ye be come over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] into the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667];
###### 11
Then ye shall appoint[^h7136] you cities[^h5892] to be cities[^h5892] of refuge[^h4733] for you; that the slayer[^h7523] may flee[^h5127] thither, which killeth[^h5221] any person[^h5315] at unawares[^h7684]. 
###### 12
And they shall be unto you cities[^h5892] for refuge[^h4733] from the avenger[^h1350]; that the manslayer[^h7523] die[^h4191] not, until he stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the congregation[^h5712] in judgment[^h4941].
###### 13
And of these cities[^h5892] which ye shall give[^h5414] six[^h8337] cities[^h5892] shall ye have for refuge[^h4733].
###### 14
Ye shall give[^h5414] three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], and three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] shall ye give[^h5414] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], which shall be cities[^h5892] of refuge[^h4733].
###### 15
These six[^h8337] cities[^h5892] shall be a refuge[^h4733], both for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and for the stranger[^h1616], and for the sojourner[^h8453] among[^h8432] them: that every one that killeth[^h5221] any person[^h5315] unawares[^h7684] may flee[^h5127] thither.
###### 16
And if he smite[^h5221] him with an instrument[^h3627] of iron[^h1270], so that he die[^h4191], he is a murderer[^h7523]: the murderer[^h7523] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 17
And if he smite[^h5221] him with throwing[^h3027] a stone[^h68], wherewith he may die[^h4191], and he die[^h4191], he is a murderer[^h7523]: the murderer[^h7523] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]. 
###### 18
Or if he smite[^h5221] him with an hand[^h3027] weapon[^h3627] of wood[^h6086], wherewith he may die[^h4191], and he die[^h4191], he is a murderer[^h7523]: the murderer[^h7523] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 19
The revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] himself shall slay[^h4191] the murderer[^h7523]: when he meeteth[^h6293] him, he[^h1931] shall slay[^h4191] him.
###### 20
But if he thrust[^h1920] him of hatred[^h8135], or hurl[^h7993] at him by laying of wait[^h6660], that he die[^h4191];
###### 21
Or in enmity[^h342] smite[^h5221] him with his hand[^h3027], that he die[^h4191]: he that smote[^h5221] him shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]; for he is a murderer[^h7523]: the revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] shall slay[^h4191] the murderer[^h7523], when he meeteth[^h6293] him.
###### 22
But if he thrust[^h1920] him suddenly[^h6621] without[^h3808] enmity[^h342], or have cast[^h7993] upon him any thing[^h3627] without laying of wait[^h6660],
###### 23
Or with any stone[^h68], wherewith a man may die[^h4191], seeing[^h7200] him not[^h3808], and cast[^h5307] it upon him, that he die[^h4191], and was not his enemy[^h341], neither sought[^h1245] his harm[^h7451]:
###### 24
Then the congregation[^h5712] shall judge[^h8199] between the slayer[^h5221] and the revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] according to these judgments[^h4941]:
###### 25
And the congregation[^h5712] shall deliver[^h5337] the slayer[^h7523] out of the hand[^h3027] of the revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818], and the congregation[^h5712] shall restore[^h7725] him to the city[^h5892] of his refuge[^h4733], whither he was fled[^h5127]: and he shall abide[^h3427] in it unto the death[^h4194] of the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548], which was anointed[^h4886] with the holy[^h6944] oil[^h8081].
###### 26
But if the slayer[^h7523] shall at any time[^h3318] come[^h3318] without the border[^h1366] of the city[^h5892] of his refuge[^h4733], whither he was fled[^h5127];
###### 27
And the revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] find[^h4672] him without[^h2351] the borders[^h1366] of the city[^h5892] of his refuge[^h4733], and the revenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818] kill[^h7523] the slayer[^h7523]; he shall not be guilty of blood[^h1818]: 
###### 28
Because he should have remained[^h3427] in the city[^h5892] of his refuge[^h4733] until the death[^h4194] of the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548]: but after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of the high[^h1419] priest[^h3548] the slayer[^h7523] shall return[^h7725] into the land[^h776] of his possession[^h272].
###### 29
So these things shall be for a statute[^h2708] of judgment[^h4941] unto you throughout your generations[^h1755] in all your dwellings[^h4186].
###### 30
Whoso killeth[^h5221] any person[^h5315], the murderer[^h7523] shall be put to death[^h7523] by the mouth[^h6310] of witnesses[^h5707]: but one[^h259] witness[^h5707] shall not testify[^h6030] against any person[^h5315] to cause him to die[^h4191].
###### 31
Moreover ye shall take[^h3947] no satisfaction[^h3724] for the life[^h5315] of a murderer[^h7523], which is guilty[^h7563] of death[^h4191]: but he shall be surely[^h4191] put to death[^h4191]. 
###### 32
And ye shall take[^h3947] no satisfaction[^h3724] for him that is fled[^h5127] to the city[^h5892] of his refuge[^h4733], that he should come again[^h7725] to dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776], until the death[^h4194] of the priest[^h3548].
###### 33
So ye shall not pollute[^h2610] the land[^h776] wherein ye are: for blood[^h1818] it defileth[^h2610] the land[^h776]: and the land[^h776] cannot be cleansed[^h3722] of the blood[^h1818] that is shed[^h8210] therein, but by the blood[^h1818] of him that shed[^h8210] it. 
###### 34
Defile[^h2930] not therefore the land[^h776] which ye shall inhabit[^h3427], wherein[^h8432] I dwell[^h7931]: for I the LORD[^h3068] dwell[^h7931] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].

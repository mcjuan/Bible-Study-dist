And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Sinai[^h5514], in the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] of the second[^h8145] year[^h8141] after they were come out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], saying[^h559],

Let the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] also keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] at his appointed season[^h4150].

In the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of this month[^h2320], at even[^h6153], ye shall keep[^h6213] it in his appointed season[^h4150]: according to all the rites[^h2708] of it, and according to all the ceremonies[^h4941] thereof, shall ye keep[^h6213] it. 
###### 4
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they should keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453].
###### 5
And they kept[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] at even[^h6153] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Sinai[^h5514]: according to all that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872], so did[^h6213] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
And there were certain men[^h582], who were defiled[^h2931] by the dead body[^h5315] of a man[^h120], that they could[^h3201] not keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] on that day[^h3117]: and they came[^h7126] before[^h6440] Moses[^h4872] and before[^h6440] Aaron[^h175] on that day[^h3117]:
###### 7
And those[^h1992] men[^h582] said[^h559] unto him, We are defiled[^h2931] by the dead body[^h5315] of a man[^h120]: wherefore are we kept back[^h1639], that we may not offer[^h7126] an offering[^h7133] of the LORD[^h3068] in his appointed season[^h4150] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto them, Stand still[^h5975], and I will hear[^h8085] what the LORD[^h3068] will command[^h6680] concerning you.
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 10
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], If any[^h376] man[^h376] of you or of your posterity[^h1755] shall be unclean[^h2931] by reason of a dead body[^h5315], or be in a journey[^h1870] afar off[^h7350], yet he shall keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
The fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the second[^h8145] month[^h2320] at even[^h6153] they shall keep[^h6213] it, and eat[^h398] it with unleavened bread[^h4682] and bitter[^h4844] herbs.
###### 12
They shall leave[^h7604] none of it unto the morning[^h1242], nor break[^h7665] any bone[^h6106] of it: according to all the ordinances[^h2708] of the passover[^h6453] they shall keep[^h6213] it.
###### 13
But the man[^h376] that is clean[^h2889], and is not in a journey[^h1870], and forbeareth[^h2308] to keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453], even the same soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from among his people[^h5971]: because he brought[^h7126] not the offering[^h7133] of the LORD[^h3068] in his appointed season[^h4150], that man[^h376] shall bear[^h5375] his sin[^h2399].
###### 14
And if a stranger[^h1616] shall sojourn[^h1481] among you, and will keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] unto the LORD[^h3068]; according to the ordinance[^h2708] of the passover[^h6453], and according to the manner[^h4941] thereof, so shall he do[^h6213]: ye shall have one[^h259] ordinance[^h2708], both for the stranger[^h1616], and for him that was born[^h249] in the land[^h776].
###### 15
And on the day[^h3117] that the tabernacle[^h4908] was reared up[^h6965] the cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] the tabernacle[^h4908], namely, the tent[^h168] of the testimony[^h5715]: and at even[^h6153] there was upon the tabernacle[^h4908] as it were the appearance[^h4758] of fire[^h784], until the morning[^h1242].
###### 16
So it was alway[^h8548]: the cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] it by day, and the appearance[^h4758] of fire[^h784] by night[^h3915].
###### 17
And when[^h6310] the cloud[^h6051] was taken up[^h5927] from the tabernacle[^h168], then after[^h310] that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] journeyed[^h5265]: and in the place[^h4725] where the cloud[^h6051] abode[^h7931], there the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] pitched their tents[^h2583].
###### 18
At the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] journeyed[^h5265], and at the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] they pitched[^h2583]: as long as[^h3117] the cloud[^h6051] abode[^h7931] upon the tabernacle[^h4908] they rested[^h2583] in their tents.
###### 19
And when the cloud[^h6051] tarried long[^h748] upon the tabernacle[^h4908] many[^h7227] days[^h3117], then the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] kept[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the LORD[^h3068], and journeyed[^h5265] not. 
###### 20
And so it was[^h3426], when the cloud[^h6051] was a few[^h4557] days[^h3117] upon the tabernacle[^h4908]; according to the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] they abode[^h2583] in their tents, and according to the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] they journeyed[^h5265].
###### 21
And so it was[^h3426], when the cloud[^h6051] abode from even[^h6153] unto the morning[^h1242], and that the cloud[^h6051] was taken up[^h5927] in the morning[^h1242], then they journeyed[^h5265]: whether it was by day[^h3119] or by night[^h3915] that the cloud[^h6051] was taken up[^h5927], they journeyed[^h5265]. 
###### 22
Or whether it were two days[^h3117], or a month[^h2320], or a year[^h3117], that the cloud[^h6051] tarried[^h748] upon the tabernacle[^h4908], remaining[^h7931] thereon, the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] abode[^h2583] in their tents, and journeyed[^h5265] not: but when it was taken up[^h5927], they journeyed[^h5265].
###### 23
At the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] they rested[^h2583] in the tents, and at the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] they journeyed[^h5265]: they kept[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the LORD[^h3068], at the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].

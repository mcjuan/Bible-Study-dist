And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Make[^h6213] thee two[^h8147] trumpets[^h2689] of silver[^h3701]; of a whole piece[^h4749] shalt thou make[^h6213] them: that thou mayest use[^h1961] them for the calling[^h4744] of the assembly[^h5712], and for the journeying[^h4550] of the camps[^h4264].
###### 3
And when they shall blow[^h8628] with them[^h2004], all the assembly[^h5712] shall assemble[^h3259] themselves to thee at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 4
And if they blow[^h8628] but with one[^h259] trumpet, then the princes[^h5387], which are heads[^h7218] of the thousands[^h505] of Israel[^h3478], shall gather[^h3259] themselves unto thee.
###### 5
When ye blow[^h8628] an alarm[^h8643], then the camps[^h4264] that lie[^h2583] on the east parts[^h6924] shall go forward[^h5265].
###### 6
When ye blow[^h8628] an alarm[^h8643] the second time[^h8145], then the camps[^h4264] that lie[^h2583] on the south side[^h8486] shall take their journey[^h5265]: they shall blow[^h8628] an alarm[^h8643] for their journeys[^h4550].

But when the congregation[^h6951] is to be gathered together[^h6950], ye shall blow[^h8628], but ye shall not sound an alarm[^h7321].

And the sons[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], the priests[^h3548], shall blow[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h2689]; and they shall be to you for an ordinance[^h2708] for ever[^h5769] throughout your generations[^h1755].
###### 9
And if ye go[^h935] to war[^h4421] in your land[^h776] against[^h6862] the enemy that oppresseth[^h6887] you, then ye shall blow an alarm[^h7321] with the trumpets[^h2689]; and ye shall be remembered[^h2142] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and ye shall be saved[^h3467] from your enemies[^h341].
###### 10
Also in the day[^h3117] of your gladness[^h8057], and in your solemn days[^h4150], and in the beginnings[^h7218] of your months[^h2320], ye shall blow[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h2689] over your burnt offerings[^h5930], and over the sacrifices[^h2077] of your peace offerings[^h8002]; that they may be to you for a memorial[^h2146] before[^h6440] your God[^h430]: I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 11

And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Hobab[^h2246], the son[^h1121] of Raguel[^h7467] the Midianite[^h4084], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], We are journeying[^h5265] unto the place[^h4725] of which the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], I will give[^h5414] it you: come[^h3212] thou with us, and we will do thee good[^h2895]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] good[^h2896] concerning Israel[^h3478].
###### 30
And he said[^h559] unto him, I will not go[^h3212]; but I will depart[^h3212] to mine own land[^h776], and to my kindred[^h4138].
###### 31
And he said[^h559], Leave[^h5800] us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest[^h3651] [^h3045] how we are to encamp[^h2583] in the wilderness[^h4057], and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes[^h5869].
###### 32
And it shall be, if thou go[^h3212] with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness[^h2896] the LORD[^h3068] shall do[^h3190] unto us, the same will we do[^h2895] unto thee.
###### 33
And they departed[^h5265] from the mount[^h2022] of the LORD[^h3068] three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870]: and the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] went[^h5265] before[^h6440] them in the three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870], to search out[^h8446] a resting place[^h4496] for them.
###### 34
And the cloud[^h6051] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon them by day[^h3119], when they went out[^h5265] of the camp[^h4264].
###### 35
And it came to pass, when the ark[^h727] set forward[^h5265], that Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Rise up[^h6965], LORD[^h3068], and let thine enemies[^h341] be scattered[^h6327]; and let them that hate[^h8130] thee flee[^h5127] before[^h6440] thee.

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Avenge[^h5358] [^h5360] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] of the Midianites[^h4084]: afterward[^h310] shalt thou be gathered[^h622] unto thy people[^h5971].
###### 3
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Arm[^h2502] some[^h582] of yourselves unto the war[^h6635], and let them go against the Midianites[^h4080], and avenge[^h5414] [^h5360] the LORD[^h3068] of Midian[^h4080].
###### 4
Of every tribe[^h4294] [^h4294] a thousand[^h505] [^h505], throughout all the tribes[^h4294] of Israel[^h3478], shall ye send[^h7971] to the war[^h6635]. 
###### 5
So there were delivered[^h4560] out of the thousands[^h505] of Israel[^h3478], a thousand[^h505] of every tribe[^h4294], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] armed[^h2502] for war[^h6635].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] them to the war[^h6635], a thousand[^h505] of every tribe[^h4294], them and Phinehas[^h6372] the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], to the war[^h6635], with the holy[^h6944] instruments[^h3627], and the trumpets[^h2689] to blow[^h8643] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 7
And they warred[^h6633] against the Midianites[^h4080], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872]; and they slew[^h2026] all the males[^h2145].
###### 8
And they slew[^h2026] the kings[^h4428] of Midian[^h4080], beside[^h5921] the rest of them that were slain[^h2491]; namely, Evi[^h189], and Rekem[^h7552], and Zur[^h6698], and Hur[^h2354], and Reba[^h7254], five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] of Midian[^h4080]: Balaam[^h1109] also the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160] they slew[^h2026] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 9
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] took all the women[^h802] of Midian[^h4080] captives[^h7617], and their little ones[^h2945], and took the spoil[^h962] of all their cattle[^h929], and all their flocks[^h4735], and all their goods[^h2428].
###### 10
And they burnt[^h8313] all their cities[^h5892] wherein they dwelt[^h4186], and all their goodly castles[^h2918], with fire[^h784].
###### 11
And they took[^h3947] all the spoil[^h7998], and all the prey[^h4455], both of men[^h120] and of beasts[^h929].
###### 12
And they brought[^h935] the captives[^h7628], and the prey[^h4455], and the spoil[^h7998], unto Moses[^h4872], and Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and unto the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], unto the camp[^h4264] at the plains[^h6160] of Moab[^h4124], which are by Jordan[^h3383] near Jericho[^h3405].
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872], and Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and all the princes[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712], went forth[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] them without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264].
###### 14
And Moses[^h4872] was wroth[^h7107] with the officers[^h6485] of the host[^h2428], with the captains[^h8269] over thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967], which came[^h935] from[^h6635] the battle[^h4421]. 
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto them, Have ye saved[^h2421] all the women[^h5347] alive[^h2421]?
###### 16
Behold, these[^h2007] caused[^h1961] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], through the counsel[^h1697] of Balaam[^h1109], to commit[^h4560] trespass[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068] in the matter[^h1697] of Peor[^h6465], and there was a plague[^h4046] among the congregation[^h5712] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
Now therefore kill[^h2026] every male[^h2145] among the little ones[^h2945], and kill[^h2026] every woman[^h802] that hath known[^h3045] man[^h376] by lying[^h4904] with him[^h2145]. 
###### 18
But all the women[^h802] children[^h2945], that have not known[^h3045] a man[^h2145] by lying[^h4904] with him, keep alive[^h2421] for yourselves.
###### 19
And do ye abide[^h2583] without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]: whosoever hath killed[^h2026] any person[^h5315], and whosoever hath touched[^h5060] any slain[^h2491], purify[^h2398] both yourselves and your captives[^h7628] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], and on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117].
###### 20
And purify[^h2398] all your raiment[^h899], and all that is made[^h3627] of skins[^h5785], and all work[^h4639] of goats'[^h5795] hair, and all things made[^h3627] of wood[^h6086]. 
###### 21
And Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548] said[^h559] unto the men[^h582] of war[^h6635] which went[^h935] to the battle[^h4421], This is the ordinance[^h2708] of the law[^h8451] which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872];
###### 22
Only the gold[^h2091], and the silver[^h3701], the brass[^h5178], the iron[^h1270], the tin[^h913], and the lead[^h5777],
###### 23
Every thing[^h1697] that may abide[^h935] the fire[^h784], ye shall make it go through[^h5674] the fire[^h784], and it shall be clean[^h2891]: nevertheless it shall be purified[^h2398] with the water[^h4325] of separation[^h5079]: and all that abideth[^h935] not the fire[^h784] ye shall make go through[^h5674] the water[^h4325].
###### 24
And ye shall wash[^h3526] your clothes[^h899] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], and ye shall be clean[^h2891], and afterward[^h310] ye shall come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264].
###### 25
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 26
Take[^h5375] the sum[^h7218] of the prey[^h4455] that was taken[^h7628], both of man[^h120] and of beast[^h929], thou, and Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and the chief[^h7218] fathers[^h1] of the congregation[^h5712]: 
###### 27
And divide[^h2673] the prey[^h4455] into two parts[^h2673]; between them that took[^h8610] the war[^h4421] upon them, who went out[^h3318] to battle[^h6635], and between all the congregation[^h5712]:
###### 28
And levy[^h7311] a tribute[^h4371] unto the LORD[^h3068] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] which went out[^h3318] to battle[^h6635]: one[^h259] soul[^h5315] of five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967], both of the persons[^h120], and of the beeves[^h1241], and of the asses[^h2543], and of the sheep[^h6629]:
###### 29
Take[^h3947] it of their half[^h4276], and give[^h5414] it unto Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], for an heave offering[^h8641] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 30
And of the children[^h1121] of Israel's[^h3478] half[^h4276], thou shalt take[^h3947] one[^h259] portion[^h270] of fifty[^h2572], of the persons[^h120], of the beeves[^h1241], of the asses[^h2543], and of the flocks[^h6629], of all manner of beasts[^h929], and give[^h5414] them unto the Levites[^h3881], which keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the tabernacle[^h4908] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 31
And Moses[^h4872] and Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548] did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 32
And the booty[^h4455], being the rest[^h3499] of the prey[^h957] which the men of[^h5971] war[^h6635] had caught[^h962], was six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] and seventy[^h7657] thousand[^h505] and five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629],

###### 36
And the half[^h4275], which was the portion[^h2506] of them that went out[^h3318] to war[^h6635], was in number[^h4557] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] and thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] sheep[^h6629]:

###### 41
And Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] the tribute[^h4371], which was the LORD'S[^h3068] heave offering[^h8641], unto Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 42
And of the children[^h1121] of Israel's[^h3478] half[^h4276], which Moses[^h4872] divided[^h2673] from the men[^h582] that warred[^h6633],
###### 43
(Now the half[^h4275] that pertained unto the congregation[^h5712] was three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] and thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] sheep[^h4480] [^h6629],

###### 48
And the officers[^h6485] which were over thousands[^h505] of the host[^h6635], the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], came near[^h7126] unto Moses[^h4872]:
###### 49
And they said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Thy servants[^h5650] have taken[^h5375] the sum[^h7218] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] which are under our charge[^h3027], and there lacketh[^h6485] not one man[^h376] of us. 
###### 50
We have therefore brought[^h7126] an oblation[^h7133] for the LORD[^h3068], what every man[^h376] hath gotten[^h4672], of jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], chains[^h685], and bracelets[^h6781], rings[^h2885], earrings[^h5694], and tablets[^h3558], to make an atonement[^h3722] for our souls[^h5315] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 51
And Moses[^h4872] and Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548] took[^h3947] the gold[^h2091] of them, even all wrought[^h4639] jewels[^h3627].
###### 52
And all the gold[^h2091] of the offering[^h8641] that they offered up[^h7311] to the LORD[^h3068], of the captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505], and of the captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], was sixteen[^h8337] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] shekels[^h8255]. 
###### 53
( For the men[^h582] of war[^h6635] had taken spoil[^h962], every man[^h376] for himself.)
###### 54

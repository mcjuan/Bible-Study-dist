###### 1
And when king[^h4428] Arad[^h6166] the Canaanite[^h3669], which dwelt[^h3427] in the south[^h5045], heard[^h8085] tell that Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] by the way[^h1870] of the spies[^h871]; then he fought[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478], and took[^h7617] some of them prisoners[^h7628].
###### 2
And Israel[^h3478] vowed[^h5087] a vow[^h5088] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], If thou wilt indeed[^h5414] deliver[^h5414] this people[^h5971] into my hand[^h3027], then I will utterly destroy[^h2763] their cities[^h5892].
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of Israel[^h3478], and delivered up[^h5414] the Canaanites[^h3669]; and they utterly destroyed[^h2763] them and their cities[^h5892]: and he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the place[^h4725] Hormah[^h2767]. 
###### 4
And they journeyed[^h5265] from mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023] by the way[^h1870] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], to compass[^h5437] the land[^h776] of Edom[^h123]: and the soul[^h5315] of the people[^h5971] was much discouraged[^h7114] because of the way[^h1870]. 
###### 5
And the people[^h5971] spake[^h1696] against God[^h430], and against Moses[^h4872], Wherefore have ye brought us up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714] to die[^h4191] in the wilderness[^h4057]? for there is no bread[^h3899], neither is there any water[^h4325]; and our soul[^h5315] loatheth[^h6973] this light[^h7052] bread[^h3899].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] fiery[^h8314] serpents[^h5175] among the people[^h5971], and they bit[^h5391] the people[^h5971]; and much[^h7227] people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478] died[^h4191].
###### 7
Therefore the people[^h5971] came[^h935] to Moses[^h4872], and said[^h559], We have sinned[^h2398], for we have spoken[^h1696] against the LORD[^h3068], and against thee; pray[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], that he take away[^h5493] the serpents[^h5175] from us. And Moses[^h4872] prayed[^h6419] for the people[^h5971].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Make[^h6213] thee a fiery serpent[^h8314], and set[^h7760] it upon a pole[^h5251]: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten[^h5391], when he looketh[^h7200] upon it, shall live[^h2425].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] made[^h6213] a serpent[^h5175] of brass[^h5178], and put[^h7760] it upon a pole[^h5251], and it came to pass, that if a serpent[^h5175] had bitten[^h5391] any man[^h376], when he beheld[^h5027] the serpent[^h5175] of brass[^h5178], he lived[^h2425].
###### 10
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] set forward[^h5265], and pitched[^h2583] in Oboth[^h88].
###### 11
And they journeyed[^h5265] from Oboth[^h88], and pitched[^h2583] at Ijeabarim[^h5863], in the wilderness[^h4057] which is before[^h6440] Moab[^h4124], toward the sunrising[^h4217] [^h8121]. 
###### 12
From thence they removed[^h5265], and pitched[^h2583] in the valley[^h5158] of Zared[^h2218].
###### 13
From thence they removed[^h5265], and pitched[^h2583] on the other side[^h5676] of Arnon[^h769], which is in the wilderness[^h4057] that cometh out[^h3318] of the coasts[^h1366] of the Amorites[^h567]: for Arnon[^h769] is the border[^h1366] of Moab[^h4124], between Moab[^h4124] and the Amorites[^h567].
###### 14
Wherefore it is said[^h559] in the book[^h5612] of the wars[^h4421] of the LORD[^h3068], What he did[^h2052] in the Red sea[^h5492], and in the brooks[^h5158] of Arnon[^h769], 
###### 15
And at the stream[^h793] of the brooks[^h5158] that goeth down[^h5186] to the dwelling[^h3427] of Ar[^h6144], and lieth[^h8172] upon the border[^h1366] of Moab[^h4124]. 
###### 16
And from thence they went to Beer[^h876]: that is the well[^h875] whereof the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Gather[^h622] the people[^h5971] together[^h622], and I will give[^h5414] them water[^h4325].
###### 17
Then Israel[^h3478] sang[^h7891] this song[^h7892], Spring up[^h5927], O well[^h875]; sing[^h6030] ye unto it:  
###### 18
The princes[^h8269] digged[^h2658] the well[^h875], the nobles[^h5081] of the people[^h5971] digged[^h3738] it, by the direction of the lawgiver[^h2710], with their staves[^h4938]. And from the wilderness[^h4057] they went to Mattanah[^h4980]:
###### 19
And from Mattanah[^h4980] to Nahaliel[^h5160]: and from Nahaliel[^h5160] to Bamoth[^h1120]:
###### 20
And from Bamoth[^h1120] in the valley[^h1516], that is in the country[^h7704] of Moab[^h4124], to the top[^h7218] of Pisgah[^h6449], which looketh[^h8259] toward[^h6440] Jeshimon[^h3452].   
###### 21
And Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], saying[^h559],
###### 22
Let me pass[^h5674] through thy land[^h776]: we will not turn[^h5186] into the fields[^h7704], or into the vineyards[^h3754]; we will not drink[^h8354] of the waters[^h4325] of the well[^h875]: but we will go along[^h3212] by the king's[^h4428] high way[^h1870], until we be past[^h5674] thy borders[^h1366].
###### 23
And Sihon[^h5511] would not suffer[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] to pass[^h5674] through his border[^h1366]: but Sihon[^h5511] gathered[^h622] all his people[^h5971] together[^h622], and went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] Israel[^h3478] into the wilderness[^h4057]: and he came[^h935] to Jahaz[^h3096], and fought[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
And Israel[^h3478] smote[^h5221] him with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and possessed[^h3423] his land[^h776] from Arnon[^h769] unto Jabbok[^h2999], even unto the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]: for the border[^h1366] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] was strong[^h5794].
###### 25
And Israel[^h3478] took[^h3947] all these cities[^h5892]: and Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in all the cities[^h5892] of the Amorites[^h567], in Heshbon[^h2809], and in all the villages[^h1323] thereof. 
###### 26
For Heshbon[^h2809] was the city[^h5892] of Sihon[^h5511] the king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], who had fought[^h3898] against the former[^h7223] king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], and taken[^h3947] all his land[^h776] out of his hand[^h3027], even unto Arnon[^h769].
###### 27
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs[^h4911] say[^h559], Come[^h935] into Heshbon[^h2809], let the city[^h5892] of Sihon[^h5511] be built[^h1129] and prepared[^h3559]:
###### 28
For there is a fire[^h784] gone out[^h3318] of Heshbon[^h2809], a flame[^h3852] from the city[^h7151] of Sihon[^h5511]: it hath consumed[^h398] Ar[^h6144] of Moab[^h4124], and the lords of the high places[^h1181] of Arnon[^h769].
###### 29
Woe[^h188] to thee, Moab[^h4124]! thou art undone[^h6], O people[^h5971] of Chemosh[^h3645]: he hath given[^h5414] his sons[^h1121] that escaped[^h6412], and his daughters[^h1323], into captivity[^h7622] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567].
###### 30
We have shot[^h3384] at them; Heshbon[^h2809] is perished[^h6] even unto Dibon[^h1769], and we have laid them waste[^h8074] even unto Nophah[^h5302], which reacheth unto Medeba[^h4311].
###### 31
Thus Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of the Amorites[^h567].
###### 32
And Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] to spy out[^h7270] Jaazer[^h3270], and they took[^h3920] the villages[^h1323] thereof, and drove out[^h3423] [^h3423] the Amorites[^h567] that were there.
###### 33
And they turned[^h6437] and went up[^h5927] by the way[^h1870] of Bashan[^h1316]: and Og[^h5747] the king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316] went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] them, he, and all his people[^h5971], to the battle[^h4421] at Edrei[^h154].
###### 34
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Fear[^h3372] him not: for I have delivered[^h5414] him into thy hand[^h3027], and all his people[^h5971], and his land[^h776]; and thou shalt do[^h6213] to him as thou didst[^h6213] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which dwelt[^h3427] at Heshbon[^h2809].
###### 35
So they smote[^h5221] him, and his sons[^h1121], and all his people[^h5971], until there was none[^h1115] left[^h7604] him alive[^h8300]: and they possessed[^h3423] his land[^h776].

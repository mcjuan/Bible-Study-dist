###### 7
And her husband[^h376] heard[^h8085] it, and held his peace[^h2790] at her in the day[^h3117] that he heard[^h8085] it: then her vows[^h5088] shall stand[^h6965], and her bonds[^h632] wherewith she bound[^h631] her soul[^h5315] shall stand[^h6965].

Every vow[^h5088], and every binding[^h632] oath[^h7621] to afflict[^h6031] the soul[^h5315], her husband[^h376] may establish[^h6965] it, or her husband[^h376] may make it void[^h6565].
###### 14
But if her husband[^h376] altogether[^h2790] hold his peace[^h2790] at her from day[^h3117] to day[^h3117]; then he establisheth[^h6965] all her vows[^h5088], or all her bonds[^h632], which are upon her: he confirmeth[^h6965] them, because he held his peace[^h2790] at her in the day[^h3117] that he heard[^h8085] them.
###### 15
But if he shall any ways[^h6565] make them void[^h6565] after[^h310] that he hath heard[^h8085] them; then he shall bear[^h5375] her iniquity[^h5771].

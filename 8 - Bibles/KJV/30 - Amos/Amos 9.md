###### 1
I saw[^h7200] the Lord[^h136] standing[^h5324] upon the altar[^h4196]: and he said[^h559], Smite[^h5221] the lintel of the door[^h3730], that the posts[^h5592] may shake[^h7493]: and cut[^h1214] them in the head[^h7218], all of them; and I will slay[^h2026] the last[^h319] of them with the sword[^h2719]: he that fleeth[^h5127] of them shall not flee away[^h5127], and he that escapeth[^h6412] of them shall not be delivered[^h4422].  
###### 2
Though they dig[^h2864] into hell[^h7585], thence shall mine hand[^h3027] take[^h3947] them; though they climb up[^h5927] to heaven[^h8064], thence will I bring them down[^h3381]:
###### 3
And though they hide[^h2244] themselves in the top[^h7218] of Carmel[^h3760], I will search[^h2664] and take them out[^h3947] thence; and though they be hid[^h5641] from my sight[^h5869] in the bottom[^h7172] of the sea[^h3220], thence will I command[^h6680] the serpent[^h5175], and he shall bite[^h5391] them:
###### 4
And though they go[^h3212] into captivity[^h7628] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341], thence will I command[^h6680] the sword[^h2719], and it shall slay[^h2026] them: and I will set[^h7760] mine eyes[^h5869] upon them for evil[^h7451], and not for good[^h2896].
###### 5
And the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of hosts[^h6635] is he that toucheth[^h5060] the land[^h776], and it shall melt[^h4127], and all that dwell[^h3427] therein shall mourn[^h56]: and it shall rise up[^h5927] wholly like a flood[^h2975]; and shall be drowned[^h8257], as by the flood[^h2975] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 6
It is he that buildeth[^h1129] his stories[^h4609] in the heaven[^h8064], and hath founded[^h3245] his troop[^h92] in the earth[^h776]; he that calleth[^h7121] for the waters[^h4325] of the sea[^h3220], and poureth them out[^h8210] upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h776]: The LORD[^h3068] is his name[^h8034].  
###### 7
Are ye not as children[^h1121] of the Ethiopians[^h3569] unto me, O children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. Have not I brought up[^h5927] Israel[^h3478] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]? and the Philistines[^h6430] from Caphtor[^h3731], and the Syrians[^h758] from Kir[^h7024]?
###### 8
Behold, the eyes[^h5869] of the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] are upon the sinful[^h2403] kingdom[^h4467], and I will destroy[^h8045] it from off the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127]; saving[^h657] that I will not utterly[^h8045] destroy[^h8045] the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
For, lo, I will command[^h6680], and I will sift[^h5128] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] among all nations[^h1471], like as corn is sifted[^h5128] in a sieve[^h3531], yet shall not the least grain[^h6872] fall[^h5307] upon the earth[^h776].  
###### 10
All the sinners[^h2400] of my people[^h5971] shall die[^h4191] by the sword[^h2719], which say[^h559], The evil[^h7451] shall not overtake[^h5066] nor prevent[^h6923] us.
###### 11
In that day[^h3117] will I raise up[^h6965] the tabernacle[^h5521] of David[^h1732] that is fallen[^h5307], and close up[^h1443] the breaches[^h6556] thereof; and I will raise up[^h6965] his ruins[^h2034], and I will build[^h1129] it as in the days[^h3117] of old[^h5769]: 
###### 12
That they may possess[^h3423] the remnant[^h7611] of Edom[^h123], and of all the heathen[^h1471], which are called[^h7121] by my name[^h8034], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] that doeth[^h6213] this. 
###### 13
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that the plowman[^h2790] shall overtake[^h5066] the reaper[^h7114], and the treader[^h1869] of grapes[^h6025] him that soweth[^h4900] seed[^h2233]; and the mountains[^h2022] shall drop[^h5197] sweet wine[^h6071], and all the hills[^h1389] shall melt[^h4127].  
###### 14
And I will bring again[^h7725] the captivity[^h7622] of my people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478], and they shall build[^h1129] the waste[^h8074] cities[^h5892], and inhabit[^h3427] them; and they shall plant[^h5193] vineyards[^h3754], and drink[^h8354] the wine[^h3196] thereof; they shall also make[^h6213] gardens[^h1593], and eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] of them.
###### 15
And I will plant[^h5193] them upon their land[^h127], and they shall no more be pulled up[^h5428] out of their land[^h127] which I have given[^h5414] them, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430].

###### 1
And it came to pass, when Solomon[^h8010] had finished[^h3615] the building[^h1129] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and all Solomon's[^h8010] desire[^h2837] which he was pleased[^h2654] to do[^h6213],
###### 2
That the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] to Solomon[^h8010] the second time[^h8145], as he had appeared[^h7200] unto him at Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, I have heard[^h8085] thy prayer[^h8605] and thy supplication[^h8467], that thou hast made[^h2603] before[^h6440] me: I have hallowed[^h6942] this house[^h1004], which thou hast built[^h1129], to put[^h7760] my name[^h8034] there for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]; and mine eyes[^h5869] and mine heart[^h3820] shall be there perpetually[^h3117].
###### 4
And if thou wilt walk[^h3212] before[^h6440] me, as David[^h1732] thy father[^h1] walked[^h1980], in integrity[^h8537] of heart[^h3824], and in uprightness[^h3476], to do[^h6213] according to all that I have commanded[^h6680] thee, and wilt keep[^h8104] my statutes[^h2706] and my judgments[^h4941]:
###### 5
Then I will establish[^h6965] the throne[^h3678] of thy kingdom[^h4467] upon Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769], as I promised[^h1696] to David[^h1732] thy father[^h1], saying[^h559], There shall not fail[^h3772] thee a man[^h376] upon the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
But if ye shall at all[^h7725] turn[^h7725] from following[^h310] me, ye or your children[^h1121], and will not keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687] and my statutes[^h2708] which I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you, but go[^h1980] and serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worship[^h7812] them:
###### 7
Then will I cut off[^h3772] Israel[^h3478] out[^h6440] of the land[^h127] which I have given[^h5414] them; and this house[^h1004], which I have hallowed[^h6942] for my name[^h8034], will I cast out[^h7971] of my sight[^h6440]; and Israel[^h3478] shall be a proverb[^h4912] and a byword[^h8148] among all people[^h5971]:
###### 8
And at this house[^h1004], which is high[^h5945], every one that passeth[^h5674] by it shall be astonished[^h8074], and shall hiss[^h8319]; and they shall say[^h559], Why hath the LORD[^h3068] done[^h6213] thus unto this land[^h776], and to this house[^h1004]?
###### 9
And they shall answer[^h559], Because they forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], who brought forth[^h3318] their fathers[^h1] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and have taken hold[^h2388] upon other[^h312] gods[^h430], and have worshipped[^h7812] them, and served[^h5647] them: therefore hath the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h935] upon them all this evil[^h7451].
###### 10
And it came to pass at the end[^h7097] of twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141], when Solomon[^h8010] had built[^h1129] the two[^h8147] houses[^h1004], the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004],
###### 11
( Now Hiram[^h2438] the king[^h4428] of Tyre[^h6865] had furnished[^h5375] Solomon[^h8010] with cedar[^h730] trees[^h6086] and fir[^h1265] trees[^h6086], and with gold[^h2091], according to all his desire[^h2656],) that then[^h227] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] gave[^h5414] Hiram[^h2438] twenty[^h6242] cities[^h5892] in the land[^h776] of Galilee[^h1551].
###### 12
And Hiram[^h2438] came out[^h3318] from Tyre[^h6865] to see[^h7200] the cities[^h5892] which Solomon[^h8010] had given[^h5414] him; and they pleased[^h3474] [^h5869] him not. 
###### 13
And he said[^h559], What cities[^h5892] are these which thou hast given[^h5414] me, my brother[^h251]? And he called[^h7121] them the land[^h776] of Cabul[^h3521] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 14
And Hiram[^h2438] sent[^h7971] to the king[^h4428] sixscore[^h3967] [^h6242] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091].
###### 15
And this is the reason[^h1697] of the levy[^h4522] which king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] raised[^h5927]; for to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and his own house[^h1004], and Millo[^h4407], and the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and Hazor[^h2674], and Megiddo[^h4023], and Gezer[^h1507].
###### 16
For Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] had gone up[^h5927], and taken[^h3920] Gezer[^h1507], and burnt[^h8313] it with fire[^h784], and slain[^h2026] the Canaanites[^h3669] that dwelt[^h3427] in the city[^h5892], and given[^h5414] it for a present[^h7964] unto his daughter[^h1323], Solomon's[^h8010] wife[^h802].
###### 17
And Solomon[^h8010] built[^h1129] Gezer[^h1507], and Bethhoron[^h1032] the nether[^h8481],
###### 18
And Baalath[^h1191], and Tadmor[^h8412] in the wilderness[^h4057], in the land[^h776],
###### 19
And all the cities[^h5892] of store[^h4543] that Solomon[^h8010] had, and cities[^h5892] for his chariots[^h7393], and cities[^h5892] for his horsemen[^h6571], and that[^h2837] which Solomon[^h8010] desired[^h2836] to build[^h1129] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and in Lebanon[^h3844], and in all the land[^h776] of his dominion[^h4475]. 
###### 20
And all the people[^h5971] that were left[^h3498] of the Amorites[^h567], Hittites[^h2850], Perizzites[^h6522], Hivites[^h2340], and Jebusites[^h2983], which were not of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478],
###### 21
Their children[^h1121] that were left[^h3498] after[^h310] them in the land[^h776], whom the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] also were not able[^h3201] utterly to destroy[^h2763], upon those did Solomon[^h8010] levy[^h5927] a tribute[^h4522] of bondservice[^h5647] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 22
But of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did Solomon[^h8010] make[^h5414] no bondmen[^h5650]: but they were men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and his servants[^h5650], and his princes[^h8269], and his captains[^h7991], and rulers[^h8269] of his chariots[^h7393], and his horsemen[^h6571].
###### 23
These were the chief[^h8269] of the officers[^h5324] that were over Solomon's[^h8010] work[^h4399], five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572], which bare rule[^h7287] over the people[^h5971] that wrought[^h6213] in the work[^h4399].
###### 24
But Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323] came up[^h5927] out of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] unto her house[^h1004] which Solomon had built[^h1129] for her: then did he build[^h1129] Millo[^h4407].
###### 25
And three[^h7969] times[^h6471] in a year[^h8141] did Solomon[^h8010] offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002] upon the altar[^h4196] which he built[^h1129] unto the LORD[^h3068], and he burnt incense[^h6999] upon the altar[^h4196] that was before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. So he finished[^h7999] the house[^h1004]. 
###### 26
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] a navy of ships[^h590] in Eziongeber[^h6100], which is beside Eloth[^h359], on the shore[^h8193] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], in the land[^h776] of Edom[^h123]. 
###### 27
And Hiram[^h2438] sent[^h7971] in the navy[^h590] his servants[^h5650], shipmen[^h582] [^h591] that had knowledge[^h3045] of the sea[^h3220], with the servants[^h5650] of Solomon[^h8010].
###### 28
And they came[^h935] to Ophir[^h211], and fetched[^h3947] from thence gold[^h2091], four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] talents[^h3603], and brought[^h935] it to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].

###### 1
Now the days[^h3117] of David[^h1732] drew nigh[^h7126] that he should die[^h4191]; and he charged[^h6680] Solomon[^h8010] his son[^h1121], saying[^h559],
###### 2
I go[^h1980] the way[^h1870] of all the earth[^h776]: be thou strong[^h2388] therefore, and shew thyself a man[^h376];
###### 3
And keep[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in his ways[^h1870], to keep[^h8104] his statutes[^h2708], and his commandments[^h4687], and his judgments[^h4941], and his testimonies[^h5715], as it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], that thou mayest prosper[^h7919] in all that thou doest[^h6213], and whithersoever thou turnest[^h6437] thyself: 
###### 4
That the LORD[^h3068] may continue[^h6965] his word[^h1697] which he spake[^h1696] concerning me, saying[^h559], If thy children[^h1121] take heed[^h8104] to their way[^h1870], to walk[^h3212] before[^h6440] me in truth[^h571] with all their heart[^h3824] and with all their soul[^h5315], there shall not fail[^h3772] thee (said[^h559] he) a man[^h376] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 5
Moreover thou knowest[^h3045] also what Joab[^h3097] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870] did[^h6213] to me, and what he did[^h6213] to the two[^h8147] captains[^h8269] of the hosts[^h6635] of Israel[^h3478], unto Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], and unto Amasa[^h6021] the son[^h1121] of Jether[^h3500], whom he slew[^h2026], and shed[^h7760] the blood[^h1818] of war[^h4421] in peace[^h7965], and put[^h5414] the blood[^h1818] of war[^h4421] upon his girdle[^h2290] that was about his loins[^h4975], and in his shoes[^h5275] that were on his feet[^h7272]. 
###### 6
Do[^h6213] therefore according to thy wisdom[^h2451], and let not his hoar head[^h7872] go down[^h3381] to the grave[^h7585] in peace[^h7965].
###### 7
But shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto the sons[^h1121] of Barzillai[^h1271] the Gileadite[^h1569], and let them be of those that eat[^h398] at thy table[^h7979]: for so they came[^h7126] to me when I fled[^h1272] because[^h6440] of Absalom[^h53] thy brother[^h251].
###### 8
And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei[^h8096] the son[^h1121] of Gera[^h1617], a Benjamite[^h1145] of Bahurim[^h980], which cursed[^h7043] me with a grievous[^h4834] curse[^h7045] in the day[^h3117] when I went[^h3212] to Mahanaim[^h4266]: but he came down[^h3381] to meet[^h7125] me at Jordan[^h3383], and I sware[^h7650] to him by the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], I will not put thee to death[^h4191] with the sword[^h2719]. 
###### 9
Now therefore hold him not guiltless[^h5352]: for thou art a wise[^h2450] man[^h376], and knowest[^h3045] what thou oughtest to do[^h6213] unto him; but his hoar head[^h7872] bring thou down[^h3381] to the grave[^h7585] with blood[^h1818].
###### 10
So David[^h1732] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732].
###### 11
And the days[^h3117] that David[^h1732] reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] were forty[^h705] years[^h8141]: seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Hebron[^h2275], and thirty[^h7970] and three[^h7969] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 12
Then sat[^h3427] Solomon[^h8010] upon the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]; and his kingdom[^h4438] was established[^h3559] greatly[^h3966].
###### 13
And Adonijah[^h138] the son[^h1121] of Haggith[^h2294] came[^h935] to Bathsheba[^h1339] the mother[^h517] of Solomon[^h8010]. And she said[^h559], Comest[^h935] thou peaceably[^h7965]? And he said[^h559], Peaceably[^h7965].
###### 14
He said[^h559] moreover, I have somewhat to say[^h1697] unto thee. And she said[^h559], Say on[^h1696].
###### 15
And he said[^h559], Thou knowest[^h3045] that the kingdom[^h4410] was mine, and that all Israel[^h3478] set[^h7760] their faces[^h6440] on me, that I should reign[^h4427]: howbeit the kingdom[^h4410] is turned about[^h5437], and is become my brother's[^h251]: for it was his from the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And now I ask[^h7592] one[^h259] petition[^h7596] of thee, deny[^h7725] me[^h6440] not. And she said[^h559] unto him, Say on[^h1696]. 
###### 17
And he said[^h559], Speak[^h559], I pray thee, unto Solomon[^h8010] the king[^h4428], (for he will not say[^h7725] thee[^h6440] nay[^h7725],) that he give[^h5414] me Abishag[^h49] the Shunammite[^h7767] to wife[^h802].
###### 18
And Bathsheba[^h1339] said[^h559], Well[^h2896]; I will speak[^h1696] for thee unto the king[^h4428].
###### 19
Bathsheba[^h1339] therefore went[^h935] unto king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010], to speak[^h1696] unto him for Adonijah[^h138]. And the king[^h4428] rose up[^h6965] to meet[^h7125] her, and bowed[^h7812] himself unto her, and sat down[^h3427] on his throne[^h3678], and caused a seat[^h3678] to be set[^h7760] for the king's[^h4428] mother[^h517]; and she sat[^h3427] on his right hand[^h3225].
###### 20
Then she said[^h559], I desire[^h7592] one[^h259] small[^h6996] petition[^h7596] of thee; I pray thee, say[^h7725] me[^h6440] not nay[^h7725]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto her, Ask on[^h7592], my mother[^h517]: for I will not say[^h7725] thee[^h6440] nay[^h7725].
###### 21
And she said[^h559], Let Abishag[^h49] the Shunammite[^h7767] be given[^h5414] to Adonijah[^h138] thy brother[^h251] to wife[^h802].
###### 22
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto his mother[^h517], And why dost thou ask[^h7592] Abishag[^h49] the Shunammite[^h7767] for Adonijah[^h138]? ask[^h7592] for him the kingdom[^h4410] also; for he is mine elder[^h1419] brother[^h251]; even for him, and for Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548], and for Joab[^h3097] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870].
###### 23
Then king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] sware[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], God[^h430] do[^h6213] so to me, and more also[^h3254], if Adonijah[^h138] have not spoken[^h1696] this word[^h1697] against his own life[^h5315].
###### 24
Now therefore, as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], which hath established[^h3559] me, and set[^h3427] me on the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and who hath made[^h6213] me an house[^h1004], as he promised[^h1696], Adonijah[^h138] shall be put to death[^h4191] this day[^h3117].
###### 25
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971] by the hand[^h3027] of Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077]; and he fell[^h6293] upon him that he died[^h4191].
###### 26
And unto Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548] said[^h559] the king[^h4428], Get[^h3212] thee to Anathoth[^h6068], unto thine own fields[^h7704]; for thou art worthy[^h376] of death[^h4194]: but I will not at this time[^h3117] put thee to death[^h4191], because thou barest[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] before[^h6440] David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and because thou hast been afflicted[^h6031] in all wherein my father[^h1] was afflicted[^h6031]. 
###### 27
So Solomon[^h8010] thrust out[^h1644] Abiathar[^h54] from being priest[^h3548] unto the LORD[^h3068]; that he might fulfil[^h4390] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] concerning the house[^h1004] of Eli[^h5941] in Shiloh[^h7887].
###### 28
Then tidings[^h8052] came[^h935] to Joab[^h3097]: for Joab[^h3097] had turned[^h5186] after[^h310] Adonijah[^h138], though he turned[^h5186] not after[^h310] Absalom[^h53]. And Joab[^h3097] fled[^h5127] unto the tabernacle[^h168] of the LORD[^h3068], and caught hold[^h2388] on the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196].
###### 29
And it was told[^h5046] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] that Joab[^h3097] was fled[^h5127] unto the tabernacle[^h168] of the LORD[^h3068]; and, behold, he is by[^h681] the altar[^h4196]. Then Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971] Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212], fall[^h6293] upon him.
###### 30
And Benaiah[^h1141] came[^h935] to the tabernacle[^h168] of the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Come forth[^h3318]. And he said[^h559], Nay; but I will die[^h4191] here. And Benaiah[^h1141] brought[^h7725] the king[^h4428] word[^h1697] again[^h7725], saying[^h559], Thus said[^h1696] Joab[^h3097], and thus he answered[^h6030] me.
###### 31
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Do[^h6213] as he hath said[^h1696], and fall[^h6293] upon him, and bury[^h6912] him; that thou mayest take away[^h5493] the innocent[^h2600] blood[^h1818], which Joab[^h3097] shed[^h8210], from me, and from the house[^h1004] of my father[^h1].
###### 32
And the LORD[^h3068] shall return[^h7725] his blood[^h1818] upon his own head[^h7218], who fell[^h6293] upon two[^h8147] men[^h582] more righteous[^h6662] and better[^h2896] than he, and slew[^h2026] them with the sword[^h2719], my father[^h1] David[^h1732] not knowing[^h3045] thereof, to wit, Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of Israel[^h3478], and Amasa[^h6021] the son[^h1121] of Jether[^h3500], captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 33
Their blood[^h1818] shall therefore return[^h7725] upon the head[^h7218] of Joab[^h3097], and upon the head[^h7218] of his seed[^h2233] for ever[^h5769]: but upon David[^h1732], and upon his seed[^h2233], and upon his house[^h1004], and upon his throne[^h3678], shall there be peace[^h7965] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769] from the LORD[^h3068].
###### 34
So Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] went up[^h5927], and fell[^h6293] upon him, and slew[^h4191] him: and he was buried[^h6912] in his own house[^h1004] in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 35
And the king[^h4428] put[^h5414] Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] in his room over the host[^h6635]: and Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548] did the king[^h4428] put[^h5414] in the room of Abiathar[^h54].
###### 36
And the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] for Shimei[^h8096], and said[^h559] unto him, Build[^h1129] thee an house[^h1004] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and dwell[^h3427] there, and go not forth[^h3318] thence any whither[^h575].
###### 37
For it shall be, that on the day[^h3117] thou goest out[^h3318], and passest over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939], thou shalt know[^h3045] for certain[^h3045] that thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]: thy blood[^h1818] shall be upon thine own head[^h7218].
###### 38
And Shimei[^h8096] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], The saying[^h1697] is good[^h2896]: as my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] hath said[^h1696], so will thy servant[^h5650] do[^h6213]. And Shimei[^h8096] dwelt[^h3427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] many[^h7227] days[^h3117].
###### 39
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of three[^h7969] years[^h8141], that two[^h8147] of the servants[^h5650] of Shimei[^h8096] ran away[^h1272] unto Achish[^h397] son[^h1121] of Maachah[^h4601] king[^h4428] of Gath[^h1661]. And they told[^h5046] Shimei[^h8096], saying[^h559], Behold, thy servants[^h5650] be in Gath[^h1661].
###### 40
And Shimei[^h8096] arose[^h6965], and saddled[^h2280] his ass[^h2543], and went[^h3212] to Gath[^h1661] to Achish[^h397] to seek[^h1245] his servants[^h5650]: and Shimei[^h8096] went[^h3212], and brought[^h935] his servants[^h5650] from Gath[^h1661].
###### 41
And it was told[^h5046] Solomon[^h8010] that Shimei[^h8096] had gone[^h1980] from Jerusalem[^h3389] to Gath[^h1661], and was come again[^h7725].
###### 42
And the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] for Shimei[^h8096], and said[^h559] unto him, Did I not make thee to swear[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068], and protested[^h5749] unto thee, saying[^h559], Know[^h3045] for a certain[^h3045], on the day[^h3117] thou goest out[^h3318], and walkest[^h1980] abroad any whither[^h575], that thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]? and thou saidst[^h559] unto me, The word[^h1697] that I have heard[^h8085] is good[^h2896].
###### 43
Why then hast thou not kept[^h8104] the oath[^h7621] of the LORD[^h3068], and the commandment[^h4687] that I have charged[^h6680] thee with?
###### 44
The king[^h4428] said[^h559] moreover to Shimei[^h8096], Thou knowest[^h3045] all the wickedness[^h7451] which thine heart[^h3824] is privy to[^h3045], that thou didst[^h6213] to David[^h1732] my father[^h1]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] shall return[^h7725] thy wickedness[^h7451] upon thine own head[^h7218];
###### 45
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] shall be blessed[^h1288], and the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732] shall be established[^h3559] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 46
So the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077]; which went out[^h3318], and fell[^h6293] upon him, that he died[^h4191]. And the kingdom[^h4467] was established[^h3559] in the hand[^h3027] of Solomon[^h8010].

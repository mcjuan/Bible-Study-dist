###### 1
And Solomon[^h8010] made affinity[^h2859] with Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and took[^h3947] Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323], and brought[^h935] her into the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], until he had made an end[^h3615] of building[^h1129] his own house[^h1004], and the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the wall[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] round about[^h5439].
###### 2
Only the people[^h5971] sacrificed[^h2076] in high places[^h1116], because there was no house[^h1004] built[^h1129] unto the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], until those days[^h3117].
###### 3
And Solomon[^h8010] loved[^h157] the LORD[^h3068], walking[^h3212] in the statutes[^h2708] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: only he sacrificed[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] in high places[^h1116].
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] went[^h3212] to Gibeon[^h1391] to sacrifice[^h2076] there; for that[^h1931] was the great[^h1419] high place[^h1116]: a thousand[^h505] burnt offerings[^h5930] did Solomon[^h8010] offer[^h5927] upon that altar[^h4196].
###### 5
In Gibeon[^h1391] the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] to Solomon[^h8010] in a dream[^h2472] by night[^h3915]: and God[^h430] said[^h559], Ask[^h7592] what I shall give[^h5414] thee.
###### 6
And Solomon[^h8010] said[^h559], Thou hast shewed[^h6213] unto thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1] great[^h1419] mercy[^h2617], according as he walked[^h1980] before[^h6440] thee in truth[^h571], and in righteousness[^h6666], and in uprightness[^h3483] of heart[^h3824] with thee; and thou hast kept[^h8104] for him this great[^h1419] kindness[^h2617], that thou hast given[^h5414] him a son[^h1121] to sit[^h3427] on his throne[^h3678], as it is this day[^h3117]. 
###### 7
And now, O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], thou hast made thy servant[^h5650] king[^h4427] instead of David[^h1732] my father[^h1]: and I am but a little[^h6996] child[^h5288]: I know[^h3045] not how to go out[^h3318] or come in[^h935].
###### 8
And thy servant[^h5650] is in the midst[^h8432] of thy people[^h5971] which thou hast chosen[^h977], a great[^h7227] people[^h5971], that cannot be numbered[^h4487] nor counted[^h5608] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 9
Give[^h5414] therefore thy servant[^h5650] an understanding[^h8085] heart[^h3820] to judge[^h8199] thy people[^h5971], that I may discern[^h995] between good[^h2896] and bad[^h7451]: for who is able[^h3201] to judge[^h8199] this thy so great[^h3515] a people[^h5971]? 
###### 10
And the speech[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] the Lord[^h136], that Solomon[^h8010] had asked[^h7592] this thing[^h1697].
###### 11
And God[^h430] said[^h559] unto him, Because thou hast asked[^h7592] this thing[^h1697], and hast not asked[^h7592] for thyself long[^h7227] life[^h3117]; neither hast asked[^h7592] riches[^h6239] for thyself, nor hast asked[^h7592] the life[^h5315] of thine enemies[^h341]; but hast asked[^h7592] for thyself understanding[^h995] to discern[^h8085] judgment[^h4941];  
###### 12
Behold, I have done[^h6213] according to thy words[^h1697]: lo, I have given[^h5414] thee a wise[^h2450] and an understanding[^h995] heart[^h3820]; so that there was none like thee before[^h6440] thee, neither after[^h310] thee shall any arise[^h6965] like unto thee.
###### 13
And I have also given[^h5414] thee that which thou hast not asked[^h7592], both riches[^h6239], and honour[^h3519]: so that there shall not be any[^h376] among the kings[^h4428] like unto thee all thy days[^h3117]. 
###### 14
And if thou wilt walk[^h3212] in my ways[^h1870], to keep[^h8104] my statutes[^h2706] and my commandments[^h4687], as thy father[^h1] David[^h1732] did walk[^h1980], then I will lengthen[^h748] thy days[^h3117].
###### 15
And Solomon[^h8010] awoke[^h3364]; and, behold, it was a dream[^h2472]. And he came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and offered up[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930], and offered[^h6213] peace offerings[^h8002], and made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960] to all his servants[^h5650].
###### 16
Then came[^h935] there two[^h8147] women[^h802], that were harlots[^h2181], unto the king[^h4428], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him.
###### 17
And the one[^h259] woman[^h802] said[^h559], O[^h994] my lord[^h113], I and this woman[^h802] dwell[^h3427] in one[^h259] house[^h1004]; and I was delivered of a child[^h3205] with her in the house[^h1004].
###### 18
And it came to pass the third[^h7992] day[^h3117] after that I was delivered[^h3205], that this woman[^h802] was delivered[^h3205] also: and we were together[^h3162]; there was no stranger[^h2114] with us in the house[^h1004], save[^h2108] we two[^h8147] in the house[^h1004].
###### 19
And this woman's[^h802] child[^h1121] died[^h4191] in the night[^h3915]; because she overlaid[^h7901] it.
###### 20
And she arose[^h6965] at midnight[^h8432] [^h3915], and took[^h3947] my son[^h1121] from beside[^h681] me, while thine handmaid[^h519] slept[^h3463], and laid[^h7901] it in her bosom[^h2436], and laid[^h7901] her dead[^h4191] child[^h1121] in my bosom[^h2436].
###### 21
And when I rose[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242] to give my child[^h1121] suck[^h3243], behold, it was dead[^h4191]: but when I had considered[^h995] it in the morning[^h1242], behold, it was not my son[^h1121], which I did bear[^h3205].
###### 22
And the other[^h312] woman[^h802] said[^h559], Nay; but the living[^h2416] is my son[^h1121], and the dead[^h4191] is thy son[^h1121]. And this said[^h559], No; but the dead[^h4191] is thy son[^h1121], and the living[^h2416] is my son[^h1121]. Thus they spake[^h1696] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 23
Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428], The one[^h2063] saith[^h559], This is my son[^h1121] that liveth[^h2416], and thy son[^h1121] is the dead[^h4191]: and the other[^h2063] saith[^h559], Nay; but thy son[^h1121] is the dead[^h4191], and my son[^h1121] is the living[^h2416].
###### 24
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Bring[^h3947] me a sword[^h2719]. And they brought[^h935] a sword[^h2719] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 25
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Divide[^h1504] the living[^h2416] child[^h3206] in two[^h8147], and give[^h5414] half[^h2677] to the one[^h259], and half[^h2677] to the other[^h259].
###### 26
Then spake[^h559] the woman[^h802] whose the living[^h2416] child[^h1121] was unto the king[^h4428], for her bowels[^h7356] yearned[^h3648] upon her son[^h1121], and she said[^h559], O[^h994] my lord[^h113], give[^h5414] her the living[^h2416] child[^h3205], and in no wise[^h4191] slay[^h4191] it. But the other said[^h559], Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide[^h1504] it. 
###### 27
Then the king[^h4428] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Give[^h5414] her the living[^h2416] child[^h3205], and in no wise[^h4191] slay[^h4191] it: she is the mother[^h517] thereof.
###### 28
And all Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] of the judgment[^h4941] which the king[^h4428] had judged[^h8199]; and they feared[^h3372] the king[^h6440]: for they saw[^h7200] that the wisdom[^h2451] of God[^h430] was in him[^h7130], to do[^h6213] judgment[^h4941].

###### 1
Now in the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028] reigned[^h4427] Abijam[^h38] over Judah[^h3063].
###### 2
Three[^h7969] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Maachah[^h4601], the daughter[^h1323] of Abishalom[^h53].
###### 3
And he walked[^h3212] in all the sins[^h2403] of his father[^h1], which he had done[^h6213] before[^h6440] him: and his heart[^h3824] was not perfect[^h8003] with the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], as the heart[^h3824] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1].
###### 4
Nevertheless for David's[^h1732] sake did the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] give[^h5414] him a lamp[^h5216] in Jerusalem[^h3389], to set up[^h6965] his son[^h1121] after[^h310] him, and to establish[^h5975] Jerusalem[^h3389]: 
###### 5
Because David[^h1732] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and turned not aside[^h5493] from any thing that he commanded[^h6680] him all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416], save only in the matter[^h1697] of Uriah[^h223] the Hittite[^h2850].
###### 6
And there was war[^h4421] between Rehoboam[^h7346] and Jeroboam[^h3379] all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].
###### 7
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Abijam[^h38], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]? And there was war[^h4421] between Abijam[^h38] and Jeroboam[^h3379].
###### 8
And Abijam[^h38] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and they buried[^h6912] him in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]: and Asa[^h609] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 9
And in the twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of Jeroboam[^h3379] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] reigned[^h4427] Asa[^h609] over Judah[^h3063].
###### 10
And forty[^h705] and one[^h259] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Maachah[^h4601], the daughter[^h1323] of Abishalom[^h53]. 
###### 11
And Asa[^h609] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], as did David[^h1732] his father[^h1].
###### 12
And he took away[^h5674] the sodomites[^h6945] out of the land[^h776], and removed[^h5493] all the idols[^h1544] that his fathers[^h1] had made[^h6213].
###### 13
And also Maachah[^h4601] his mother[^h517], even her he removed[^h5493] from being queen[^h1377], because she had made[^h6213] an idol[^h4656] in a grove[^h842]; and Asa[^h609] destroyed[^h3772] her idol[^h4656], and burnt[^h8313] it by the brook[^h5158] Kidron[^h6939]. 
###### 14
But the high places[^h1116] were not removed[^h5493]: nevertheless Asa's[^h609] heart[^h3824] was perfect[^h8003] with the LORD[^h3068] all his days[^h3117].
###### 15
And he brought[^h935] in the things[^h6944] which his father[^h1] had dedicated[^h6944], and the things which himself had dedicated[^h6944], into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], silver[^h3701], and gold[^h2091], and vessels[^h3627]. 
###### 16
And there was war[^h4421] between Asa[^h609] and Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] all their days[^h3117].
###### 17
And Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927] against Judah[^h3063], and built[^h1129] Ramah[^h7414], that he might not suffer[^h5414] any to go out[^h3318] or come in[^h935] to Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 18
Then Asa[^h609] took[^h3947] all the silver[^h3701] and the gold[^h2091] that were left[^h3498] in the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of his servants[^h5650]: and king[^h4428] Asa[^h609] sent[^h7971] them to Benhadad[^h1130], the son[^h1121] of Tabrimon[^h2886], the son[^h1121] of Hezion[^h2383], king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], that dwelt[^h3427] at Damascus[^h1834], saying[^h559],
###### 19
There is a league[^h1285] between me and thee, and between my father[^h1] and thy father[^h1]: behold, I have sent[^h7971] unto thee a present[^h7810] of silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091]; come[^h3212] and break[^h6565] thy league[^h1285] with Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that he may depart[^h5927] from me. 
###### 20
So Benhadad[^h1130] hearkened[^h8085] unto king[^h4428] Asa[^h609], and sent[^h7971] the captains[^h8269] of the hosts[^h2428] which he had against the cities[^h5892] of Israel[^h3478], and smote[^h5221] Ijon[^h5859], and Dan[^h1835], and Abelbethmaachah[^h62], and all Cinneroth[^h3672], with all the land[^h776] of Naphtali[^h5321].
###### 21
And it came to pass, when Baasha[^h1201] heard[^h8085] thereof, that he left off[^h2308] building[^h1129] of Ramah[^h7414], and dwelt[^h3427] in Tirzah[^h8656].
###### 22
Then king[^h4428] Asa[^h609] made a proclamation[^h8085] throughout all Judah[^h3063]; none was exempted[^h5355]: and they took[^h5375] away the stones[^h68] of Ramah[^h7414], and the timber[^h6086] thereof, wherewith Baasha[^h1201] had builded[^h1129]; and king[^h4428] Asa[^h609] built[^h1129] with them Geba[^h1387] of Benjamin[^h1144], and Mizpah[^h4709]. 
###### 23
The rest[^h3499] of all the acts[^h1697] of Asa[^h609], and all his might[^h1369], and all that he did[^h6213], and the cities[^h5892] which he built[^h1129], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]? Nevertheless in the time[^h6256] of his old age[^h2209] he was diseased[^h2470] in his feet[^h7272].
###### 24
And Asa[^h609] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead. 
###### 25
And Nadab[^h5070] the son[^h1121] of Jeroboam[^h3379] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in the second[^h8147] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] two[^h8147] years[^h8141]. 
###### 26
And he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of his father[^h1], and in his sin[^h2403] wherewith he made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 27
And Baasha[^h1201] the son[^h1121] of Ahijah[^h281], of the house[^h1004] of Issachar[^h3485], conspired[^h7194] against him; and Baasha[^h1201] smote[^h5221] him at Gibbethon[^h1405], which belonged to the Philistines[^h6430]; for Nadab[^h5070] and all Israel[^h3478] laid siege[^h6696] to Gibbethon[^h1405].
###### 28
Even in the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] did Baasha[^h1201] slay[^h4191] him, and reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 29
And it came to pass, when he reigned[^h4427], that he smote[^h5221] all the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379]; he left[^h7604] not to Jeroboam[^h3379] any that breathed[^h5397], until he had destroyed[^h8045] him, according unto the saying[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] his servant[^h5650] Ahijah[^h281] the Shilonite[^h7888]:
###### 30
Because of the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] which he sinned[^h2398], and which he made Israel[^h3478] sin[^h2398], by his provocation[^h3708] wherewith he provoked the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] to anger[^h3707].
###### 31
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Nadab[^h5070], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 32
And there was war[^h4421] between Asa[^h609] and Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] all their days[^h3117].
###### 33
In the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Baasha[^h1201] the son[^h1121] of Ahijah[^h281] to reign[^h4427] over all Israel[^h3478] in Tirzah[^h8656], twenty[^h6242] and four[^h702] years[^h8141].
###### 34
And he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of Jeroboam[^h3379], and in his sin[^h2403] wherewith he made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].

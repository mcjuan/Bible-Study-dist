###### 1
And it came to pass after many[^h7227] days[^h3117], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Elijah[^h452] in the third[^h7992] year[^h8141], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212], shew[^h7200] thyself unto Ahab[^h256]; and I will send[^h5414] rain[^h4306] upon[^h6440] the earth[^h127].
###### 2
And Elijah[^h452] went[^h3212] to shew[^h7200] himself unto Ahab[^h256]. And there was a sore[^h2389] famine[^h7458] in Samaria[^h8111].
###### 3
And Ahab[^h256] called[^h7121] Obadiah[^h5662], which was the governor of his house[^h1004]. (Now Obadiah[^h5662] feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068] greatly[^h3966]:  
###### 4
For it was so, when Jezebel[^h348] cut off[^h3772] the prophets[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068], that Obadiah[^h5662] took[^h3947] an hundred[^h3967] prophets[^h5030], and hid[^h2244] them by fifty[^h376] [^h2572] in a cave[^h4631], and fed[^h3557] them with bread[^h3899] and water[^h4325].) 
###### 5
And Ahab[^h256] said[^h559] unto Obadiah[^h5662], Go[^h3212] into the land[^h776], unto all fountains[^h4599] of water[^h4325], and unto all brooks[^h5158]: peradventure[^h194] we may find[^h4672] grass[^h2682] to save[^h2421] the horses[^h5483] and mules[^h6505] alive[^h2421], that we lose[^h3772] not all the beasts[^h929]. 
###### 6
So they divided[^h2505] the land[^h776] between them to pass throughout[^h5674] it: Ahab[^h256] went[^h1980] one[^h259] way[^h1870] by himself, and Obadiah[^h5662] went[^h1980] another[^h259] way[^h1870] by himself.
###### 7
And as Obadiah[^h5662] was in the way[^h1870], behold, Elijah[^h452] met[^h7125] him: and he knew[^h5234] him, and fell[^h5307] on his face[^h6440], and said[^h559], Art thou that my lord[^h113] Elijah[^h452]?
###### 8
And he answered[^h559] him, I am: go[^h3212], tell[^h559] thy lord[^h113], Behold, Elijah[^h452] is here.
###### 9
And he said[^h559], What have I sinned[^h2398], that thou wouldest deliver[^h5414] thy servant[^h5650] into the hand[^h3027] of Ahab[^h256], to slay[^h4191] me?
###### 10
As the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] liveth[^h2416], there is no[^h3426] nation[^h1471] or kingdom[^h4467], whither[^h834] my lord[^h113] hath not sent[^h7971] to seek[^h1245] thee: and when they said[^h559], He is not there; he took an oath[^h7650] of the kingdom[^h4467] and nation[^h1471], that they found[^h4672] thee not.
###### 11
And now thou sayest[^h559], Go[^h3212], tell[^h559] thy lord[^h113], Behold, Elijah[^h452] is here.
###### 12
And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone[^h3212] from thee, that the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] shall carry[^h5375] thee whither I know[^h3045] not; and so when I come[^h935] and tell[^h5046] Ahab[^h256], and he cannot find[^h4672] thee, he shall slay[^h2026] me: but I thy servant[^h5650] fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] from my youth[^h5271].
###### 13
Was it not told[^h5046] my lord[^h113] what I did[^h6213] when Jezebel[^h348] slew[^h2026] the prophets[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068], how I hid[^h2244] an hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] of the LORD'S[^h3068] prophets[^h5030] by fifty[^h2572] in a cave[^h4631], and fed[^h3557] them with bread[^h3899] and water[^h4325]?
###### 14
And now thou sayest[^h559], Go[^h3212], tell[^h559] thy lord[^h113], Behold, Elijah[^h452] is here: and he shall slay[^h2026] me.
###### 15
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] liveth[^h2416], before[^h6440] whom I stand[^h5975], I will surely shew[^h7200] myself unto him to day[^h3117].
###### 16
So Obadiah[^h5662] went[^h3212] to meet[^h7125] Ahab[^h256], and told[^h5046] him: and Ahab[^h256] went[^h3212] to meet[^h7125] Elijah[^h452].
###### 17
And it came to pass, when Ahab[^h256] saw[^h7200] Elijah[^h452], that Ahab[^h256] said[^h559] unto him, Art thou he that troubleth[^h5916] Israel[^h3478]?
###### 18
And he answered[^h559], I have not troubled[^h5916] Israel[^h3478]; but thou, and thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], in that ye have forsaken[^h5800] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068], and thou hast followed[^h3212] [^h310] Baalim[^h1168].
###### 19
Now therefore send[^h7971], and gather[^h6908] to me all Israel[^h3478] unto mount[^h2022] Carmel[^h3760], and the prophets[^h5030] of Baal[^h1168] four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572], and the prophets[^h5030] of the groves[^h842] four[^h702] hundred[^h3967], which eat[^h398] at Jezebel's[^h348] table[^h7979].
###### 20
So Ahab[^h256] sent[^h7971] unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and gathered[^h6908] the prophets[^h5030] together[^h6908] unto mount[^h2022] Carmel[^h3760].
###### 21
And Elijah[^h452] came[^h5066] unto all the people[^h5971], and said[^h559], How long[^h5921] halt[^h6452] ye between two[^h8147] opinions[^h5587]? if the LORD[^h3068] be God[^h430], follow him: but if Baal[^h1168], then follow[^h3212] [^h310] him. And the people[^h5971] answered[^h6030] him not a word[^h1697]. 
###### 22
Then said[^h559] Elijah[^h452] unto the people[^h5971], I, even I only, remain[^h3498] a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068]; but Baal's[^h1168] prophets[^h5030] are four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572] men[^h376].
###### 23
Let them therefore give[^h5414] us two[^h8147] bullocks[^h6499]; and let them choose[^h977] one[^h259] bullock[^h6499] for themselves, and cut it in pieces[^h5408], and lay[^h7760] it on wood[^h6086], and put[^h7760] no fire[^h784] under: and I will dress[^h6213] the other[^h259] bullock[^h6499], and lay[^h5414] it on wood[^h6086], and put[^h7760] no fire[^h784] under:
###### 24
And call[^h7121] ye on the name[^h8034] of your gods[^h430], and I will call[^h7121] on the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]: and the God[^h430] that answereth[^h6030] by fire[^h784], let him be God[^h430]. And all the people[^h5971] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], It is well[^h2896] spoken[^h1697]. 
###### 25
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto the prophets[^h5030] of Baal[^h1168], Choose[^h977] you one[^h259] bullock[^h6499] for yourselves, and dress[^h6213] it first[^h7223]; for ye are many[^h7227]; and call[^h7121] on the name[^h8034] of your gods[^h430], but put[^h7760] no fire[^h784] under.
###### 26
And they took[^h3947] the bullock[^h6499] which was given[^h5414] them, and they dressed[^h6213] it, and called[^h7121] on the name[^h8034] of Baal[^h1168] from morning[^h1242] even until noon[^h6672], saying[^h559], O Baal[^h1168], hear[^h6030] us. But there was no[^h369] voice[^h6963], nor any that answered[^h6030]. And they leaped[^h6452] upon the altar[^h4196] which was made[^h6213].   
###### 27
And it came to pass at noon[^h6672], that Elijah[^h452] mocked[^h2048] them, and said[^h559], Cry[^h7121] aloud[^h1419] [^h6963]: for he is a god[^h430]; either he is talking[^h7879], or he is pursuing[^h7873], or he is in a journey[^h1870], or peradventure[^h194] he sleepeth[^h3463], and must be awaked[^h3364].   
###### 28
And they cried[^h7121] aloud[^h6963] [^h1419], and cut[^h1413] themselves after their manner[^h4941] with knives[^h2719] and lancets[^h7420], till the blood[^h1818] gushed out[^h8210] upon them. 
###### 29
And it came to pass, when midday[^h6672] was past[^h5674], and they prophesied[^h5012] until the time of the offering[^h5927] of the evening sacrifice[^h4503], that there was neither voice[^h6963], nor any to answer[^h6030], nor any that regarded[^h7182].  
###### 30
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], Come near[^h5066] unto me. And all the people[^h5971] came near[^h5066] unto him. And he repaired[^h7495] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] that was broken down[^h2040].
###### 31
And Elijah[^h452] took[^h3947] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] stones[^h68], according to the number[^h4557] of the tribes[^h7626] of the sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290], unto whom the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came, saying[^h559], Israel[^h3478] shall be thy name[^h8034]:
###### 32
And with the stones[^h68] he built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]: and he made[^h6213] a trench[^h8585] about[^h5439] the altar[^h4196], as great as would contain[^h1004] two measures[^h5429] of seed[^h2233].
###### 33
And he put[^h6186] the wood[^h6086] in order[^h6186], and cut[^h5408] the bullock[^h6499] in pieces, and laid[^h7760] him on the wood[^h6086], and said[^h559], Fill[^h4390] four[^h702] barrels[^h3537] with water[^h4325], and pour[^h3332] it on the burnt sacrifice[^h5930], and on the wood[^h6086].
###### 34
And he said[^h559], Do it the second time[^h8138]. And they did it the second time[^h8138]. And he said[^h559], Do it the third time[^h8027]. And they did it the third time[^h8027].
###### 35
And the water[^h4325] ran[^h3212] round about[^h5439] the altar[^h4196]; and he filled[^h4390] the trench[^h8585] also with water[^h4325]. 
###### 36
And it came to pass at the time of the offering[^h5927] of the evening sacrifice[^h4503], that Elijah[^h452] the prophet[^h5030] came near[^h5066], and said[^h559], LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and of Israel[^h3478], let it be known[^h3045] this day[^h3117] that thou art God[^h430] in Israel[^h3478], and that I am thy servant[^h5650], and that I have done[^h6213] all these things at thy word[^h1697].
###### 37
Hear[^h6030] me, O LORD[^h3068], hear[^h6030] me, that this people[^h5971] may know[^h3045] that thou art the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430], and that thou hast turned[^h5437] their heart[^h3820] back[^h5437] again[^h322].
###### 38
Then the fire[^h784] of the LORD[^h3068] fell[^h5307], and consumed[^h398] the burnt sacrifice[^h5930], and the wood[^h6086], and the stones[^h68], and the dust[^h6083], and licked up[^h3897] the water[^h4325] that was in the trench[^h8585].
###### 39
And when all the people[^h5971] saw[^h7200] it, they fell[^h5307] on their faces[^h6440]: and they said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068], he is the God[^h430]; the LORD[^h3068], he is the God[^h430].
###### 40
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto them, Take[^h8610] the prophets[^h5030] of Baal[^h1168]; let not one[^h376] of them escape[^h4422]. And they took[^h8610] them: and Elijah[^h452] brought them down[^h3381] to the brook[^h5158] Kishon[^h7028], and slew[^h7819] them there. 
###### 41
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto Ahab[^h256], Get thee up[^h5927], eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354]; for there is a sound[^h6963] of abundance[^h1995] of rain[^h1653]. 
###### 42
So Ahab[^h256] went up[^h5927] to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354]. And Elijah[^h452] went up[^h5927] to the top[^h7218] of Carmel[^h3760]; and he cast himself down[^h1457] upon the earth[^h776], and put[^h7760] his face[^h6440] between his knees[^h1290],
###### 43
And said[^h559] to his servant[^h5288], Go up[^h5927] now, look[^h5027] toward[^h1870] the sea[^h3220]. And he went up[^h5927], and looked[^h5027], and said[^h559], There is nothing[^h3972]. And he said[^h559], Go again[^h7725] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471].
###### 44
And it came to pass at the seventh time[^h7637], that he said[^h559], Behold, there ariseth[^h5927] a little[^h6996] cloud[^h5645] out of the sea[^h3220], like a man's[^h376] hand[^h3709]. And he said[^h559], Go up[^h5927], say[^h559] unto Ahab[^h256], Prepare[^h631] thy chariot, and get thee down[^h3381], that the rain[^h1653] stop[^h6113] thee not. 
###### 45
And it came to pass in the mean while[^h3541], that the heaven[^h8064] was black[^h6937] with clouds[^h5645] and wind[^h7307], and there was a great[^h1419] rain[^h1653]. And Ahab[^h256] rode[^h7392], and went[^h3212] to Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 46
And the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was on Elijah[^h452]; and he girded up[^h8151] his loins[^h4975], and ran[^h7323] before[^h6440] Ahab[^h256] to the entrance[^h935] of Jezreel[^h3157].

###### 1
And, behold, there came[^h935] a man[^h376] of God[^h430] out of Judah[^h3063] by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Bethel[^h1008]: and Jeroboam[^h3379] stood[^h5975] by the altar[^h4196] to burn incense[^h6999]. 
###### 2
And he cried[^h7121] against the altar[^h4196] in the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O altar[^h4196], altar[^h4196], thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, a child[^h1121] shall be born[^h3205] unto the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], Josiah[^h2977] by name[^h8034]; and upon thee shall he offer[^h2076] the priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116] that burn incense[^h6999] upon thee, and men's[^h120] bones[^h6106] shall be burnt[^h8313] upon thee.
###### 3
And he gave[^h5414] a sign[^h4159] the same day[^h3117], saying[^h559], This is the sign[^h4159] which the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696]; Behold, the altar[^h4196] shall be rent[^h7167], and the ashes[^h1880] that are upon it shall be poured out[^h8210].
###### 4
And it came to pass, when king[^h4428] Jeroboam[^h3379] heard[^h8085] the saying[^h1697] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430], which had cried[^h7121] against the altar[^h4196] in Bethel[^h1008], that he put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] from the altar[^h4196], saying[^h559], Lay hold[^h8610] on him. And his hand[^h3027], which he put forth[^h7971] against him, dried up[^h3001], so that he could[^h3201] not pull it in again[^h7725] to him.
###### 5
The altar[^h4196] also was rent[^h7167], and the ashes[^h1880] poured out[^h8210] from the altar[^h4196], according to the sign[^h4159] which the man[^h376] of God[^h430] had given[^h5414] by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And the king[^h4428] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto the man[^h376] of God[^h430], Intreat[^h2470] now the face[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and pray[^h6419] for me, that my hand[^h3027] may be restored me again[^h7725]. And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] besought[^h2470] [^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] hand[^h3027] was restored him again[^h7725], and became as it was before[^h7223]. 
###### 7
And the king[^h4428] said[^h1696] unto the man[^h376] of God[^h430], Come[^h935] home[^h1004] with me, and refresh[^h5582] thyself, and I will give[^h5414] thee a reward[^h4991].
###### 8
And the man[^h376] of God[^h430] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], If thou wilt give[^h5414] me half[^h2677] thine house[^h1004], I will not go in[^h935] with thee, neither will I eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325] in this place[^h4725]:
###### 9
For so was it charged[^h6680] me by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Eat[^h398] no bread[^h3899], nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325], nor turn again[^h7725] by the same way[^h1870] that thou camest[^h1980].
###### 10
So he went[^h3212] another[^h312] way[^h1870], and returned[^h7725] not by the way[^h1870] that he came[^h935] to Bethel[^h1008].
###### 11
Now there dwelt[^h3427] an[^h259] old[^h2205] prophet[^h5030] in Bethel[^h1008]; and his sons[^h1121] came[^h935] and told[^h5608] him all the works[^h4639] that the man[^h376] of God[^h430] had done[^h6213] that day[^h3117] in Bethel[^h1008]: the words[^h1697] which he had spoken[^h1696] unto the king[^h4428], them they told[^h5608] also to their father[^h1].
###### 12
And their father[^h1] said[^h1696] unto them, What way[^h1870] went[^h1980] he? For his sons[^h1121] had seen[^h7200] what[^h335] way[^h1870] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] went[^h1980], which came[^h935] from Judah[^h3063].
###### 13
And he said[^h559] unto his sons[^h1121], Saddle[^h2280] me the ass[^h2543]. So they saddled[^h2280] him the ass[^h2543]: and he rode[^h7392] thereon,
###### 14
And went[^h3212] after[^h310] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and found[^h4672] him sitting[^h3427] under an oak[^h424]: and he said[^h559] unto him, Art thou the man[^h376] of God[^h430] that camest[^h935] from Judah[^h3063]? And he said[^h559], I am.
###### 15
Then he said[^h559] unto him, Come[^h3212] home[^h1004] with me, and eat[^h398] bread[^h3899].
###### 16
And he said[^h559], I may[^h3201] not return[^h7725] with thee, nor go in[^h935] with thee: neither will I eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325] with thee in this place[^h4725]:
###### 17
For it was said[^h1697] to me by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], Thou shalt eat[^h398] no bread[^h3899] nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325] there, nor turn again[^h7725] to go[^h3212] by the way[^h1870] that thou camest[^h1980]. 
###### 18
He said[^h559] unto him, I am a prophet[^h5030] also as thou art; and an angel[^h4397] spake[^h1696] unto me by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Bring him back[^h7725] with thee into thine house[^h1004], that he may eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] and drink[^h8354] water[^h4325]. But he lied[^h3584] unto him.
###### 19
So he went back[^h7725] with him, and did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] in his house[^h1004], and drank[^h8354] water[^h4325].
###### 20
And it came to pass, as they sat[^h3427] at the table[^h7979], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto the prophet[^h5030] that brought him back[^h7725]:
###### 21
And he cried[^h7121] unto the man[^h376] of God[^h430] that came[^h935] from Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Forasmuch as[^h3282] thou hast disobeyed[^h4784] the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], and hast not kept[^h8104] the commandment[^h4687] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] thee,
###### 22
But camest back[^h7725], and hast eaten[^h398] bread[^h3899] and drunk[^h8354] water[^h4325] in the place[^h4725], of the which the LORD did say[^h1696] to thee, Eat[^h398] no bread[^h3899], and drink[^h8354] no water[^h4325]; thy carcase[^h5038] shall not come[^h935] unto the sepulchre[^h6913] of thy fathers[^h1].
###### 23
And it came to pass, after[^h310] he had eaten[^h398] bread[^h3899], and after[^h310] he had drunk[^h8354], that he saddled[^h2280] for him the ass[^h2543], to wit, for the prophet[^h5030] whom he had brought back[^h7725].
###### 24
And when he was gone[^h3212], a lion[^h738] met[^h4672] him by the way[^h1870], and slew[^h4191] him: and his carcase[^h5038] was cast[^h7993] in the way[^h1870], and the ass[^h2543] stood[^h5975] by[^h681] it, the lion[^h738] also stood[^h5975] by the carcase[^h5038].
###### 25
And, behold, men[^h582] passed by[^h5674], and saw[^h7200] the carcase[^h5038] cast[^h7993] in the way[^h1870], and the lion[^h738] standing[^h5975] by[^h681] the carcase[^h5038]: and they came[^h935] and told[^h1696] it in the city[^h5892] where the old[^h2205] prophet[^h5030] dwelt[^h3427].
###### 26
And when the prophet[^h5030] that brought him back[^h7725] from the way[^h1870] heard[^h8085] thereof, he said[^h559], It is the man[^h376] of God[^h430], who was disobedient[^h4784] unto the word[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] him unto the lion[^h738], which hath torn[^h7665] him, and slain[^h4191] him, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] unto him. 
###### 27
And he spake[^h1696] to his sons[^h1121], saying[^h559], Saddle[^h2280] me the ass[^h2543]. And they saddled[^h2280] him.
###### 28
And he went[^h3212] and found[^h4672] his carcase[^h5038] cast[^h7993] in the way[^h1870], and the ass[^h2543] and the lion[^h738] standing[^h5975] by[^h681] the carcase[^h5038]: the lion[^h738] had not eaten[^h398] the carcase[^h5038], nor torn[^h7665] the ass[^h2543]. 
###### 29
And the prophet[^h5030] took up[^h5375] the carcase[^h5038] of the man[^h376] of God[^h430], and laid[^h3240] it upon the ass[^h2543], and brought it back[^h7725]: and the old[^h2205] prophet[^h5030] came[^h935] to the city[^h5892], to mourn[^h5594] and to bury[^h6912] him.
###### 30
And he laid[^h3240] his carcase[^h5038] in his own grave[^h6913]; and they mourned[^h5594] over him, saying, Alas[^h1945], my brother[^h251]!
###### 31
And it came to pass, after[^h310] he had buried[^h6912] him, that he spake[^h559] to his sons[^h1121], saying[^h559], When I am dead[^h4191], then bury[^h6912] me in the sepulchre[^h6913] wherein the man[^h376] of God[^h430] is buried[^h6912]; lay[^h3240] my bones[^h6106] beside[^h681] his bones[^h6106]:
###### 32
For the saying[^h1697] which he cried[^h7121] by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] against the altar[^h4196] in Bethel[^h1008], and against all the houses[^h1004] of the high places[^h1116] which are in the cities[^h5892] of Samaria[^h8111], shall surely come to pass.
###### 33
After[^h310] this thing[^h1697] Jeroboam[^h3379] returned[^h7725] not from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], but made[^h6213] again[^h7725] of the lowest[^h7098] of the people[^h5971] priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116]: whosoever would[^h2655], he consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] him, and he became one of the priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116].  
###### 34
And this thing[^h1697] became sin[^h2403] unto the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379], even to cut it off[^h3582], and to destroy[^h8045] it from off the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127].

###### 1
At that time[^h6256] Abijah[^h29] the son[^h1121] of Jeroboam[^h3379] fell sick[^h2470].
###### 2
And Jeroboam[^h3379] said[^h559] to his wife[^h802], Arise[^h6965], I pray thee, and disguise[^h8138] thyself, that thou be not known[^h3045] to be the wife[^h802] of Jeroboam[^h3379]; and get[^h1980] thee to Shiloh[^h7887]: behold, there is Ahijah[^h281] the prophet[^h5030], which told[^h1696] me that I should be king[^h4428] over this people[^h5971].
###### 3
And take[^h3947] with thee[^h3027] ten[^h6235] loaves[^h3899], and cracknels[^h5350], and a cruse[^h1228] of honey[^h1706], and go[^h935] to him: he shall tell[^h5046] thee what shall become of the child[^h5288].   
###### 4
And Jeroboam's[^h3379] wife[^h802] did so[^h6213], and arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to Shiloh[^h7887], and came[^h935] to the house[^h1004] of Ahijah[^h281]. But Ahijah[^h281] could[^h3201] not see[^h7200]; for his eyes[^h5869] were set[^h6965] by reason of his age[^h7869]. 
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Ahijah[^h281], Behold, the wife[^h802] of Jeroboam[^h3379] cometh[^h935] to ask[^h1875] a thing[^h1697] of thee for her son[^h1121]; for he is sick[^h2470]: thus[^h2090] and thus shalt thou say[^h1696] unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in[^h935], that she shall feign herself to be another[^h5234] woman.
###### 6
And it was so, when Ahijah[^h281] heard[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of her feet[^h7272], as she came in[^h935] at the door[^h6607], that he said[^h559], Come in[^h935], thou wife[^h802] of Jeroboam[^h3379]; why feignest thou thyself to be another[^h5234]? for I am sent[^h7971] to thee with heavy[^h7186] tidings. 
###### 7
Go[^h3212], tell[^h559] Jeroboam[^h3379], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Forasmuch as[^h3282] I exalted[^h7311] thee from among[^h8432] the people[^h5971], and made[^h5414] thee prince[^h5057] over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478],
###### 8
And rent[^h7167] the kingdom[^h4467] away[^h7167] from the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], and gave[^h5414] it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732], who kept[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687], and who followed[^h1980] [^h310] me with all his heart[^h3824], to do[^h6213] that only which was right[^h3477] in mine eyes[^h5869];
###### 9
But hast done[^h6213] evil[^h7489] above all that were before[^h6440] thee: for thou hast gone[^h3212] and made[^h6213] thee other[^h312] gods[^h430], and molten images[^h4541], to provoke me to anger[^h3707], and hast cast[^h7993] me behind[^h310] thy back[^h1458]:
###### 10
Therefore, behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379], and will cut off[^h3772] from Jeroboam[^h3379] him that pisseth[^h8366] against the wall[^h7023], and him that is shut up[^h6113] and left[^h5800] in Israel[^h3478], and will take away[^h1197] the remnant[^h310] of the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379], as a man taketh away[^h1197] dung[^h1557], till it be all gone[^h8552].
###### 11
Him that dieth[^h4191] of Jeroboam[^h3379] in the city[^h5892] shall the dogs[^h3611] eat[^h398]; and him that dieth[^h4191] in the field[^h7704] shall the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064] eat[^h398]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 12
Arise[^h6965] thou therefore, get[^h3212] thee to thine own house[^h1004]: and when thy feet[^h7272] enter[^h935] into the city[^h5892], the child[^h3206] shall die[^h4191].
###### 13
And all Israel[^h3478] shall mourn[^h5594] for him, and bury[^h6912] him: for he only of Jeroboam[^h3379] shall come[^h935] to the grave[^h6913], because in him there is found[^h4672] some good[^h2896] thing[^h1697] toward the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] in the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379].
###### 14
Moreover the LORD[^h3068] shall raise him up[^h6965] a king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478], who shall cut off[^h3772] the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379] that day[^h3117]: but what? even now.
###### 15
For the LORD[^h3068] shall smite[^h5221] Israel[^h3478], as a reed[^h7070] is shaken[^h5110] in the water[^h4325], and he shall root up[^h5428] Israel[^h3478] out of this good[^h2896] land[^h127], which he gave[^h5414] to their fathers[^h1], and shall scatter[^h2219] them beyond[^h5676] the river[^h5104], because they have made[^h6213] their groves[^h842], provoking the LORD[^h3068] to anger[^h3707].
###### 16
And he shall give[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] up[^h5414] because[^h1558] of the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379], who did sin[^h2398], and who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 17
And Jeroboam's[^h3379] wife[^h802] arose[^h6965], and departed[^h3212], and came[^h935] to Tirzah[^h8656]: and when she came[^h935] to the threshold[^h5592] of the door[^h1004], the child[^h5288] died[^h4191];
###### 18
And they buried[^h6912] him; and all Israel[^h3478] mourned[^h5594] for him, according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of his servant[^h5650] Ahijah[^h281] the prophet[^h5030].
###### 19
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jeroboam[^h3379], how he warred[^h3898], and how he reigned[^h4427], behold, they are written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 20
And the days[^h3117] which Jeroboam[^h3379] reigned[^h4427] were two[^h8147] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141]: and he slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and Nadab[^h5070] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead. 
###### 21
And Rehoboam[^h7346] the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010] reigned[^h4427] in Judah[^h3063]. Rehoboam[^h7346] was forty[^h705] and one[^h259] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] seventeen[^h7651] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389], the city[^h5892] which the LORD[^h3068] did choose[^h977] out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], to put[^h7760] his name[^h8034] there. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Naamah[^h5279] an Ammonitess[^h5985].
###### 22
And Judah[^h3063] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and they provoked him to jealousy[^h7065] with their sins[^h2403] which they had committed[^h2398], above all that their fathers[^h1] had done[^h6213].
###### 23
For they also built[^h1129] them high places[^h1116], and images[^h4676], and groves[^h842], on every high[^h1364] hill[^h1389], and under every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086]. 
###### 24
And there were also sodomites[^h6945] in the land[^h776]: and they did[^h6213] according to all the abominations[^h8441] of the nations[^h1471] which the LORD[^h3068] cast out[^h3423] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 25
And it came to pass in the fifth[^h2549] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346], that Shishak[^h7895] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] came up[^h5927] against Jerusalem[^h3389]:
###### 26
And he took away[^h3947] the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the treasures[^h214] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]; he even took away[^h3947] all: and he took away[^h3947] all the shields[^h4043] of gold[^h2091] which Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213].
###### 27
And king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] made[^h6213] in their stead brasen[^h5178] shields[^h4043], and committed[^h6485] them unto the hands[^h3027] of the chief[^h8269] of the guard[^h7323], which kept[^h8104] the door[^h6607] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]. 
###### 28
And it was so, when[^h1767] the king[^h4428] went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], that the guard[^h7323] bare[^h5375] them, and brought them back[^h7725] into the guard[^h7323] chamber[^h8372].
###### 29
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Rehoboam[^h7346], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 30
And there was war[^h4421] between Rehoboam[^h7346] and Jeroboam[^h3379] all their days[^h3117].
###### 31
And Rehoboam[^h7346] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Naamah[^h5279] an Ammonitess[^h5985]. And Abijam[^h38] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

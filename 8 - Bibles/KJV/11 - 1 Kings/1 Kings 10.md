###### 1
And when the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] heard[^h8085] of the fame[^h8088] of Solomon[^h8010] concerning the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], she came[^h935] to prove[^h5254] him with hard questions[^h2420].
###### 2
And she came[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389] with a very[^h3966] great[^h3515] train[^h2428], with camels[^h1581] that bare[^h5375] spices[^h1314], and very[^h3966] much[^h7227] gold[^h2091], and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68]: and when she was come[^h935] to Solomon[^h8010], she communed[^h1696] with him of all that was in her heart[^h3824].
###### 3
And Solomon[^h8010] told[^h5046] her all her questions[^h1697]: there was not any thing[^h1697] hid[^h5956] from the king[^h4428], which he told[^h5046] her not. 
###### 4
And when the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] had seen[^h7200] all Solomon's[^h8010] wisdom[^h2451], and the house[^h1004] that he had built[^h1129],
###### 5
And the meat[^h3978] of his table[^h7979], and the sitting[^h4186] of his servants[^h5650], and the attendance[^h4612] of his ministers[^h8334], and their apparel[^h4403], and his cupbearers[^h8248], and his ascent[^h5930] by which he went up[^h5927] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; there was no more spirit[^h7307] in her.  
###### 6
And she said[^h559] to the king[^h4428], It was a true[^h571] report[^h1697] that I heard[^h8085] in mine own land[^h776] of thy acts[^h1697] and of thy wisdom[^h2451].  
###### 7
Howbeit I believed[^h539] not the words[^h1697], until I came[^h935], and mine eyes[^h5869] had seen[^h7200] it: and, behold, the half[^h2677] was not told[^h5046] me: thy wisdom[^h2451] and prosperity[^h2896] exceedeth[^h3254] the fame[^h8052] which I heard[^h8085]. 
###### 8
Happy[^h835] are thy men[^h582], happy[^h835] are these thy servants[^h5650], which stand[^h5975] continually[^h8548] before[^h6440] thee, and that hear[^h8085] thy wisdom[^h2451].
###### 9
Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], which delighted[^h2654] in thee, to set[^h5414] thee on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478]: because the LORD[^h3068] loved[^h160] Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769], therefore made[^h7760] he thee king[^h4428], to do[^h6213] judgment[^h4941] and justice[^h6666].
###### 10
And she gave[^h5414] the king[^h4428] an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091], and of spices[^h1314] very[^h3966] great store[^h7235], and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68]: there came[^h935] no more such[^h1931] abundance[^h7230] of spices[^h1314] as these which the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] gave[^h5414] to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].
###### 11
And the navy[^h590] also of Hiram[^h2438], that brought[^h5375] gold[^h2091] from Ophir[^h211], brought in[^h935] from Ophir[^h211] great[^h3966] plenty[^h7235] of almug[^h484] trees[^h6086], and precious[^h3368] stones[^h68].
###### 12
And the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] of the almug[^h484] trees[^h6086] pillars[^h4552] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], harps[^h3658] also and psalteries[^h5035] for singers[^h7891]: there came[^h935] no such almug[^h484] trees[^h6086], nor were seen[^h7200] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 13
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] gave[^h5414] unto the queen[^h4436] of Sheba[^h7614] all her desire[^h2656], whatsoever she asked[^h7592], beside that which Solomon[^h8010] gave[^h5414] her of his royal[^h4428] bounty[^h3027]. So she turned[^h6437] and went[^h3212] to her own country[^h776], she and her servants[^h5650]. 
###### 14
Now the weight[^h4948] of gold[^h2091] that came[^h935] to Solomon[^h8010] in one[^h259] year[^h8141] was six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] threescore[^h8346] and six[^h8337] talents[^h3603] of gold[^h2091],
###### 15
Beside that he had of the merchantmen[^h582] [^h8446], and of the traffick[^h4536] of the spice merchants[^h7402], and of all the kings[^h4428] of Arabia[^h6153], and of the governors[^h6346] of the country[^h776]. 
###### 16
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] two hundred[^h3967] targets[^h6793] of beaten[^h7820] gold[^h2091]: six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels of gold[^h2091] went[^h5927] to one[^h259] target[^h6793].
###### 17
And he made three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] shields[^h4043] of beaten[^h7820] gold[^h2091]; three[^h7969] pound[^h4488] of gold[^h2091] went[^h5927] to one[^h259] shield[^h4043]: and the king[^h4428] put[^h5414] them in the house[^h1004] of the forest[^h3293] of Lebanon[^h3844].
###### 18
Moreover the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] a great[^h1419] throne[^h3678] of ivory[^h8127], and overlaid[^h6823] it with the best[^h6338] gold[^h2091].
###### 19
The throne[^h3678] had six[^h8337] steps[^h4609], and the top[^h7218] of the throne[^h3678] was round[^h5696] behind[^h310]: and there were stays[^h3027] on either side on the place[^h4725] of the seat[^h7675], and two[^h8147] lions[^h738] stood[^h5975] beside[^h681] the stays[^h3027].  
###### 20
And twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] lions[^h738] stood[^h5975] there on the one side and on the other upon the six[^h8337] steps[^h4609]: there was not the like[^h3651] made[^h6213] in any kingdom[^h4467]. 
###### 21
And all king[^h4428] Solomon's[^h8010] drinking[^h4945] vessels[^h3627] were of gold[^h2091], and all the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of the forest[^h3293] of Lebanon[^h3844] were of pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091]; none were of silver[^h3701]: it was nothing[^h3972] accounted[^h2803] of in the days[^h3117] of Solomon[^h8010]. 
###### 22
For the king[^h4428] had at sea[^h3220] a navy[^h590] of Tharshish[^h8659] with the navy[^h590] of Hiram[^h2438]: once[^h259] in three[^h7969] years[^h8141] came[^h935] the navy[^h590] of Tharshish[^h8659], bringing[^h5375] gold[^h2091], and silver[^h3701], ivory[^h8143], and apes[^h6971], and peacocks[^h8500]. 
###### 23
So king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] exceeded[^h1431] all the kings[^h4428] of the earth[^h776] for riches[^h6239] and for wisdom[^h2451].
###### 24
And all the earth[^h776] sought[^h1245] to[^h6440] Solomon[^h8010], to hear[^h8085] his wisdom[^h2451], which God[^h430] had put[^h5414] in his heart[^h3820]. 
###### 25
And they brought[^h935] every man[^h376] his present[^h4503], vessels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], and vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], and garments[^h8008], and armour[^h5402], and spices[^h1314], horses[^h5483], and mules[^h6505], a rate[^h1697] year[^h8141] by year[^h8141].
###### 26
And Solomon[^h8010] gathered together[^h622] chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571]: and he had a thousand[^h505] and four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h7393], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571], whom he bestowed[^h5148] in the cities[^h5892] for chariots[^h7393], and with the king[^h4428] at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 27
And the king[^h4428] made[^h5414] silver[^h3701] to be in Jerusalem[^h3389] as stones[^h68], and cedars[^h730] made[^h5414] he to be as the sycomore trees[^h8256] that are in the vale[^h8219], for abundance[^h7230]. 
###### 28
And Solomon[^h8010] had horses[^h5483] brought[^h4161] out of Egypt[^h4714], and linen yarn[^h4723]: the king's[^h4428] merchants[^h5503] received[^h3947] the linen yarn[^h4723] at a price[^h4242]. 
###### 29
And a chariot[^h4818] came up[^h5927] and went out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714] for six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701], and an horse[^h5483] for an hundred[^h3967] and fifty[^h2572]: and so for all the kings[^h4428] of the Hittites[^h2850], and for the kings[^h4428] of Syria[^h758], did they bring them out[^h3318] by their means[^h3027].

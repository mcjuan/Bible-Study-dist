###### 1
And Benhadad[^h1130] the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] gathered[^h6908] all his host[^h2428] together[^h6908]: and there were thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] with him, and horses[^h5483], and chariots[^h7393]: and he went up[^h5927] and besieged[^h6696] Samaria[^h8111], and warred[^h3898] against it.
###### 2
And he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] into the city[^h5892], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] Benhadad[^h1130],
###### 3
Thy silver[^h3701] and thy gold[^h2091] is mine; thy wives[^h802] also and thy children[^h1121], even the goodliest[^h2896], are mine.
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], My lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], according to thy saying[^h1697], I am thine, and all that I have.
###### 5
And the messengers[^h4397] came again[^h7725], and said[^h559], Thus speaketh[^h559] Benhadad[^h1130], saying[^h559], Although I have sent[^h7971] unto thee, saying[^h559], Thou shalt deliver[^h5414] me thy silver[^h3701], and thy gold[^h2091], and thy wives[^h802], and thy children[^h1121];
###### 6
Yet I will send[^h7971] my servants[^h5650] unto thee to morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256], and they shall search[^h2664] thine house[^h1004], and the houses[^h1004] of thy servants[^h5650]; and it shall be[^h1961], that whatsoever is pleasant[^h4261] in thine eyes[^h5869], they shall put[^h7760] it in their hand[^h3027], and take it away[^h3947]. 
###### 7
Then the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] called[^h7121] all the elders[^h2205] of the land[^h776], and said[^h559], Mark[^h3045], I pray you, and see[^h7200] how this man seeketh[^h1245] mischief[^h7451]: for he sent[^h7971] unto me for my wives[^h802], and for my children[^h1121], and for my silver[^h3701], and for my gold[^h2091]; and I denied[^h4513] him not. 
###### 8
And all the elders[^h2205] and all the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto him, Hearken[^h8085] not unto him, nor consent[^h14].
###### 9
Wherefore he said[^h559] unto the messengers[^h4397] of Benhadad[^h1130], Tell[^h559] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], All that thou didst send[^h7971] for to thy servant[^h5650] at the first[^h7223] I will do[^h6213]: but this thing[^h1697] I may[^h3201] not do[^h6213]. And the messengers[^h4397] departed[^h3212], and brought[^h7725] him word[^h1697] again[^h7725].
###### 10
And Benhadad[^h1130] sent[^h7971] unto him, and said[^h559], The gods[^h430] do so[^h6213] unto me, and more also[^h3254], if the dust[^h6083] of Samaria[^h8111] shall suffice[^h5606] for handfuls[^h8168] for all the people[^h5971] that follow[^h7272] me. 
###### 11
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Tell[^h1696] him, Let not him that girdeth[^h2296] on his harness boast[^h1984] himself as he that putteth it off[^h6605].
###### 12
And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard[^h8085] this message[^h1697], as he was drinking[^h8354], he and the kings[^h4428] in the pavilions[^h5521], that he said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Set[^h7760] yourselves in array. And they set[^h7760] themselves in array against the city[^h5892].   
###### 13
And, behold, there came[^h5066] a[^h259] prophet[^h5030] unto Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Hast thou seen[^h7200] all this great[^h1419] multitude[^h1995]? behold, I will deliver[^h5414] it into thine hand[^h3027] this day[^h3117]; and thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 14
And Ahab[^h256] said[^h559], By whom? And he said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Even by the young men[^h5288] of the princes[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082]. Then he said[^h559], Who shall order[^h631] the battle[^h4421]? And he answered[^h559], Thou.  
###### 15
Then he numbered[^h6485] the young men[^h5288] of the princes[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082], and they were two[^h8147] hundred[^h3967] and thirty[^h7970] two[^h8147]: and after[^h310] them he numbered[^h6485] all the people[^h5971], even all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], being seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505].
###### 16
And they went out[^h3318] at noon[^h6672]. But Benhadad[^h1130] was drinking[^h8354] himself drunk[^h7910] in the pavilions[^h5521], he and the kings[^h4428], the thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] that helped[^h5826] him.
###### 17
And the young men[^h5288] of the princes[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082] went out[^h3318] first[^h7223]; and Benhadad[^h1130] sent out[^h7971], and they told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], There are men[^h582] come out[^h3318] of Samaria[^h8111].
###### 18
And he said[^h559], Whether they be come out[^h3318] for peace[^h7965], take[^h8610] them alive[^h2416]; or whether they be come out[^h3318] for war[^h4421], take[^h8610] them alive[^h2416].
###### 19
So these young men[^h5288] of the princes[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082] came out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892], and the army[^h2428] which followed[^h310] them.
###### 20
And they slew[^h5221] every one[^h376] his man[^h376]: and the Syrians[^h758] fled[^h5127]; and Israel[^h3478] pursued[^h7291] them: and Benhadad[^h1130] the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] escaped[^h4422] on an horse[^h5483] with the horsemen[^h6571].
###### 21
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318], and smote[^h5221] the horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h7393], and slew[^h5221] the Syrians[^h758] with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347].
###### 22
And the prophet[^h5030] came[^h5066] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212], strengthen[^h2388] thyself, and mark[^h3045], and see[^h7200] what thou doest[^h6213]: for at the return[^h8666] of the year[^h8141] the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] will come up[^h5927] against thee.
###### 23
And the servants[^h5650] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] said[^h559] unto him, Their gods[^h430] are gods[^h430] of the hills[^h2022]; therefore they were stronger[^h2388] than we; but[^h199] let us fight[^h3898] against them in the plain[^h4334], and surely[^h3808] we shall be stronger[^h2388] than they.
###### 24
And do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], Take[^h5493] the kings[^h4428] away, every man[^h376] out of his place[^h4725], and put[^h7760] captains[^h6346] in their rooms:
###### 25
And number[^h4487] thee an army[^h2428], like the army[^h2428] that thou hast lost[^h5307], horse[^h5483] for horse[^h5483], and chariot[^h7393] for chariot[^h7393]: and we will fight[^h3898] against[^h854] them in the plain[^h4334], and surely we shall be stronger[^h2388] than they. And he hearkened[^h8085] unto their voice[^h6963], and did so[^h6213]. 
###### 26
And it came to pass at the return[^h8666] of the year[^h8141], that Benhadad[^h1130] numbered[^h6485] the Syrians[^h758], and went up[^h5927] to Aphek[^h663], to fight[^h4421] against Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 27
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were numbered[^h6485], and were all present[^h3557], and went[^h3212] against[^h7125] them: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] pitched[^h2583] before them like two[^h8147] little flocks[^h2835] of kids[^h5795]; but the Syrians[^h758] filled[^h4390] the country[^h776]. 
###### 28
And there came[^h5066] a man[^h376] of God[^h430], and spake[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Because the Syrians[^h758] have said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] is God[^h430] of the hills[^h2022], but he is not God[^h430] of the valleys[^h6010], therefore will I deliver[^h5414] all this great[^h1419] multitude[^h1995] into thine hand[^h3027], and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 29
And they pitched[^h2583] one[^h428] over against[^h5227] the other[^h428] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]. And so it was, that in the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] the battle[^h4421] was joined[^h7126]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] slew[^h5221] of the Syrians[^h758] an hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h7273] in one[^h259] day[^h3117].
###### 30
But the rest[^h3498] fled[^h5127] to Aphek[^h663], into the city[^h5892]; and there a wall[^h2346] fell[^h5307] upon twenty[^h6242] and seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] of the men[^h376] that were left[^h3498]. And Benhadad[^h1130] fled[^h5127], and came[^h935] into the city[^h5892], into an inner[^h2315] chamber[^h2315]. 
###### 31
And his servants[^h5650] said[^h559] unto him, Behold now, we have heard[^h8085] that the kings[^h4428] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] are merciful[^h2617] kings[^h4428]: let us, I pray thee, put[^h7760] sackcloth[^h8242] on our loins[^h4975], and ropes[^h2256] upon our heads[^h7218], and go out[^h3318] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]: peradventure he will save[^h2421] thy life[^h5315].
###### 32
So they girded[^h2296] sackcloth[^h8242] on their loins[^h4975], and put ropes[^h2256] on their heads[^h7218], and came[^h935] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] Benhadad[^h1130] saith[^h559], I pray thee, let me live[^h2421] [^h5315]. And he said[^h559], Is he yet alive[^h2416]? he is my brother[^h251].
###### 33
Now the men[^h582] did diligently observe[^h5172] whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily[^h4116] catch[^h2480] it: and they said[^h559], Thy brother[^h251] Benhadad[^h1130]. Then he said[^h559], Go[^h935] ye, bring[^h3947] him. Then Benhadad[^h1130] came forth[^h3318] to him; and he caused him to come up[^h5927] into the chariot[^h4818].
###### 34
And Benhadad said[^h559] unto him, The cities[^h5892], which my father[^h1] took[^h3947] from thy father[^h1], I will restore[^h7725]; and thou shalt make[^h7760] streets[^h2351] for thee in Damascus[^h1834], as my father[^h1] made[^h7760] in Samaria[^h8111]. Then said Ahab, I will send thee away[^h7971] with this covenant[^h1285]. So he made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with him, and sent him away[^h7971].
###### 35
And a certain[^h259] man[^h376] of the sons[^h1121] of the prophets[^h5030] said[^h559] unto his neighbour[^h7453] in the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], Smite[^h5221] me, I pray thee. And the man[^h376] refused[^h3985] to smite[^h5221] him.
###### 36
Then said[^h559] he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], behold, as soon as thou art departed[^h1980] from me, a lion[^h738] shall slay[^h5221] thee. And as soon as he was departed[^h3212] from him[^h681], a lion[^h738] found[^h4672] him, and slew[^h5221] him.
###### 37
Then he found[^h4672] another[^h312] man[^h376], and said[^h559], Smite[^h5221] me, I pray thee. And the man[^h376] smote[^h5221] him, so that in smiting[^h5221] he wounded[^h6481] him. 
###### 38
So the prophet[^h5030] departed[^h3212], and waited[^h5975] for the king[^h4428] by the way[^h1870], and disguised[^h2664] himself with ashes[^h666] upon his face[^h5869].
###### 39
And as the king[^h4428] passed by[^h5674], he cried[^h6817] unto the king[^h4428]: and he said[^h559], Thy servant[^h5650] went out[^h3318] into the midst[^h7130] of the battle[^h4421]; and, behold, a man[^h376] turned aside[^h5493], and brought[^h935] a man[^h376] unto me, and said[^h559], Keep[^h8104] this man[^h376]: if by any means[^h6485] he be missing[^h6485], then shall thy life[^h5315] be for his life[^h5315], or else thou shalt pay[^h8254] a talent[^h3603] of silver[^h3701]. 
###### 40
And as thy servant[^h5650] was busy[^h6213] here and there, he was gone[^h369]. And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto him, So shall thy judgment[^h4941] be; thyself hast decided[^h2782] it. 
###### 41
And he hasted[^h4116], and took the ashes[^h666] away[^h5493] from his face[^h5869]; and the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] discerned[^h5234] him that he was of the prophets[^h5030].
###### 42
And he said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Because thou hast let go[^h7971] out of thy hand[^h3027] a man[^h376] whom I appointed to utter destruction[^h2764], therefore thy life[^h5315] shall go for his life[^h5315], and thy people[^h5971] for his people[^h5971].
###### 43
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h3212] to his house[^h1004] heavy[^h5620] and displeased[^h2198], and came[^h935] to Samaria[^h8111].

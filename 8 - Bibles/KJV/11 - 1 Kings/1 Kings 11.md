###### 1
But king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] loved[^h157] many[^h7227] strange[^h5237] women[^h802], together with the daughter[^h1323] of Pharaoh[^h6547], women of the Moabites[^h4125], Ammonites[^h5984], Edomites[^h130], Zidonians[^h6722], and Hittites[^h2850]; 
###### 2
Of the nations[^h1471] concerning which the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Ye shall not go in[^h935] to them, neither shall they come in[^h935] unto you: for surely[^h403] they will turn away[^h5186] your heart[^h3824] after[^h310] their gods[^h430]: Solomon[^h8010] clave[^h1692] unto these in love[^h157].
###### 3
And he had seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] wives[^h802], princesses[^h8282], and three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] concubines[^h6370]: and his wives[^h802] turned away[^h5186] his heart[^h3820].
###### 4
For it came to pass, when[^h6256] Solomon[^h8010] was old[^h2209], that his wives[^h802] turned away[^h5186] his heart[^h3824] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430]: and his heart[^h3824] was not perfect[^h8003] with the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], as was the heart[^h3824] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1].
###### 5
For Solomon[^h8010] went[^h3212] after[^h310] Ashtoreth[^h6253] the goddess[^h430] of the Zidonians[^h6722], and after[^h310] Milcom[^h4445] the abomination[^h8251] of the Ammonites[^h5984].
###### 6
And Solomon[^h8010] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and went not fully[^h4390] after[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], as did David[^h1732] his father[^h1]. 
###### 7
Then did Solomon[^h8010] build[^h1129] an high place[^h1116] for Chemosh[^h3645], the abomination[^h8251] of Moab[^h4124], in the hill[^h2022] that is before[^h6440] Jerusalem[^h3389], and for Molech[^h4432], the abomination[^h8251] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 8
And likewise did[^h6213] he for all his strange[^h5237] wives[^h802], which burnt incense[^h6999] and sacrificed[^h2076] unto their gods[^h430].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] was angry[^h599] with Solomon[^h8010], because his heart[^h3824] was turned[^h5186] from the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], which had appeared[^h7200] unto him twice[^h6471],
###### 10
And had commanded[^h6680] him concerning this thing[^h1697], that he should not go[^h3212] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430]: but he kept[^h8104] not that which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680].
###### 11
Wherefore the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Solomon[^h8010], Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept[^h8104] my covenant[^h1285] and my statutes[^h2708], which I have commanded[^h6680] thee, I will surely[^h7167] rend[^h7167] the kingdom[^h4467] from thee, and will give[^h5414] it to thy servant[^h5650]. 
###### 12
Notwithstanding in thy days[^h3117] I will not do[^h6213] it for David[^h1732] thy father's[^h1] sake: but I will rend[^h7167] it out of the hand[^h3027] of thy son[^h1121].
###### 13
Howbeit[^h7535] I will not rend away[^h7167] all the kingdom[^h4467]; but will give[^h5414] one[^h259] tribe[^h7626] to thy son[^h1121] for David[^h1732] my servant's[^h5650] sake, and for Jerusalem's[^h3389] sake which I have chosen[^h977].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] stirred up[^h6965] an adversary[^h7854] unto Solomon[^h8010], Hadad[^h1908] the Edomite[^h130]: he was of the king's[^h4428] seed[^h2233] in Edom[^h123].
###### 15
For it came to pass, when David[^h1732] was in Edom[^h123], and Joab[^h3097] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] was gone up[^h5927] to bury[^h6912] the slain[^h2491], after he had smitten[^h5221] every male[^h2145] in Edom[^h123];
###### 16
(For six[^h8337] months[^h2320] did Joab[^h3097] remain[^h3427] there with all Israel[^h3478], until he had cut off[^h3772] every male[^h2145] in Edom[^h123]:)
###### 17
That Hadad[^h111] fled[^h1272], he and certain[^h582] Edomites[^h130] of his father's[^h1] servants[^h5650] with him, to go[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714]; Hadad[^h1908] being yet a little[^h6996] child[^h5288].
###### 18
And they arose[^h6965] out of Midian[^h4080], and came[^h935] to Paran[^h6290]: and they took[^h3947] men[^h582] with them out of Paran[^h6290], and they came[^h935] to Egypt[^h4714], unto Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714]; which gave[^h5414] him an house[^h1004], and appointed[^h559] him victuals[^h3899], and gave[^h5414] him land[^h776].
###### 19
And Hadad[^h1908] found[^h4672] great[^h3966] favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of Pharaoh[^h6547], so that he gave[^h5414] him to wife[^h802] the sister[^h269] of his own wife[^h802], the sister[^h269] of Tahpenes[^h8472] the queen[^h1377].
###### 20
And the sister[^h269] of Tahpenes[^h8472] bare[^h3205] him Genubath[^h1592] his son[^h1121], whom Tahpenes[^h8472] weaned[^h1580] in[^h8432] Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004]: and Genubath[^h1592] was in Pharaoh's[^h6547] household[^h1004] among[^h8432] the sons[^h1121] of Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 21
And when Hadad[^h1908] heard[^h8085] in Egypt[^h4714] that David[^h1732] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and that Joab[^h3097] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] was dead[^h4191], Hadad[^h1908] said[^h559] to Pharaoh[^h6547], Let me depart[^h7971], that I may go[^h3212] to mine own country[^h776]. 
###### 22
Then Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto him, But what hast thou lacked[^h2638] with me, that, behold, thou seekest[^h1245] to go[^h3212] to thine own country[^h776]? And he answered[^h559], Nothing: howbeit let me go[^h7971] in any wise[^h7971]. 
###### 23
And God[^h430] stirred him up[^h6965] another adversary[^h7854], Rezon[^h7331] the son[^h1121] of Eliadah[^h450], which fled[^h1272] from his lord[^h113] Hadadezer[^h1909] king[^h4428] of Zobah[^h6678]:
###### 24
And he gathered[^h6908] men[^h582] unto him, and became captain[^h8269] over a band[^h1416], when David[^h1732] slew[^h2026] them of Zobah: and they went[^h3212] to Damascus[^h1834], and dwelt[^h3427] therein, and reigned[^h4427] in Damascus[^h1834].
###### 25
And he was an adversary[^h7854] to Israel[^h3478] all the days[^h3117] of Solomon[^h8010], beside the mischief[^h7451] that Hadad[^h1908] did: and he abhorred[^h6973] Israel[^h3478], and reigned[^h4427] over Syria[^h758].
###### 26
And Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], an Ephrathite[^h673] of Zereda[^h6868], Solomon's[^h8010] servant[^h5650], whose mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Zeruah[^h6871], a widow[^h490] woman[^h802], even he lifted up[^h7311] his hand[^h3027] against the king[^h4428].
###### 27
And this was the cause[^h1697] that he lifted up[^h7311] his hand[^h3027] against the king[^h4428]: Solomon[^h8010] built[^h1129] Millo[^h4407], and repaired[^h5462] the breaches[^h6556] of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]. 
###### 28
And the man[^h376] Jeroboam[^h3379] was a mighty man[^h1368] of valour[^h2428]: and Solomon[^h8010] seeing[^h7200] the young man[^h5288] that he was industrious[^h6213] [^h4399], he made him ruler[^h6485] over all the charge[^h5447] of the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130].  
###### 29
And it came to pass at that time[^h6256] when Jeroboam[^h3379] went out[^h3318] of Jerusalem[^h3389], that the prophet[^h5030] Ahijah[^h281] the Shilonite[^h7888] found[^h4672] him in the way[^h1870]; and he had clad[^h3680] himself with a new[^h2319] garment[^h8008]; and they two[^h8147] were alone in the field[^h7704]:
###### 30
And Ahijah[^h281] caught[^h8610] the new[^h2319] garment[^h8008] that was on him, and rent[^h7167] it in twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] pieces[^h7168]:
###### 31
And he said[^h559] to Jeroboam[^h3379], Take[^h3947] thee ten[^h6235] pieces[^h7168]: for thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Behold, I will rend[^h7167] the kingdom[^h4467] out of the hand[^h3027] of Solomon[^h8010], and will give[^h5414] ten[^h6235] tribes[^h7626] to thee:
###### 32
(But he shall have one[^h259] tribe[^h7626] for my servant[^h5650] David's[^h1732] sake, and for Jerusalem's[^h3389] sake, the city[^h5892] which I have chosen[^h977] out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478]:)
###### 33
Because that they have forsaken[^h5800] me, and have worshipped[^h7812] Ashtoreth[^h6253] the goddess[^h430] of the Zidonians[^h6722], Chemosh[^h3645] the god[^h430] of the Moabites[^h4124], and Milcom[^h4445] the god[^h430] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and have not walked[^h1980] in my ways[^h1870], to do[^h6213] that which is right[^h3477] in mine eyes[^h5869], and to keep my statutes[^h2708] and my judgments[^h4941], as did David[^h1732] his father[^h1].
###### 34
Howbeit I will not take[^h3947] the whole kingdom[^h4467] out of his hand[^h3027]: but I will make[^h7896] him prince[^h5387] all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416] for David[^h1732] my servant's[^h5650] sake, whom I chose[^h977], because he kept[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687] and my statutes[^h2708]:
###### 35
But I will take[^h3947] the kingdom[^h4410] out of his son's[^h1121] hand[^h3027], and will give[^h5414] it unto thee, even ten[^h6235] tribes[^h7626].
###### 36
And unto his son[^h1121] will I give[^h5414] one[^h259] tribe[^h7626], that David[^h1732] my servant[^h5650] may have a light[^h5216] alway[^h3117] before[^h6440] me in Jerusalem[^h3389], the city[^h5892] which I have chosen[^h977] me to put[^h7760] my name[^h8034] there. 
###### 37
And I will take[^h3947] thee, and thou shalt reign[^h4427] according to all that thy soul[^h5315] desireth[^h183], and shalt be king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 38
And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken[^h8085] unto all that I command[^h6680] thee, and wilt walk[^h1980] in my ways[^h1870], and do[^h6213] that is right[^h3477] in my sight[^h5869], to keep[^h8104] my statutes[^h2708] and my commandments[^h4687], as David[^h1732] my servant[^h5650] did[^h6213]; that I will be with thee, and build[^h1129] thee a sure[^h539] house[^h1004], as I built[^h1129] for David[^h1732], and will give[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] unto thee.
###### 39
And I will for this afflict[^h6031] the seed[^h2233] of David[^h1732], but not for ever[^h3117].
###### 40
Solomon[^h8010] sought[^h1245] therefore to kill[^h4191] Jeroboam[^h3379]. And Jeroboam[^h3379] arose[^h6965], and fled[^h1272] into Egypt[^h4714], unto Shishak[^h7895] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and was in Egypt[^h4714] until the death[^h4194] of Solomon[^h8010].
###### 41
And the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Solomon[^h8010], and all that he did[^h6213], and his wisdom[^h2451], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the acts[^h1697] of Solomon[^h8010]? 
###### 42
And the time[^h3117] that Solomon[^h8010] reigned[^h4427] in Jerusalem[^h3389] over all Israel[^h3478] was forty[^h705] years[^h8141]. 
###### 43
And Solomon[^h8010] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: and Rehoboam[^h7346] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.

###### 1
But Solomon[^h8010] was building[^h1129] his own house[^h1004] thirteen[^h7969] [^h6240] years[^h8141], and he finished[^h3615] all his house[^h1004].
###### 2
He built[^h1129] also the house[^h1004] of the forest[^h3293] of Lebanon[^h3844]; the length[^h753] thereof was an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] thereof fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the height[^h6967] thereof thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520], upon four[^h702] rows[^h2905] of cedar[^h730] pillars[^h5982], with cedar[^h730] beams[^h3773] upon the pillars[^h5982].
###### 3
And it was covered[^h5603] with cedar[^h730] above[^h4605] upon the beams[^h6763], that lay on forty[^h705] five[^h2568] pillars[^h5982], fifteen[^h6240] in a row[^h2905]. 
###### 4
And there were windows[^h8261] in three[^h7969] rows[^h2905], and light[^h4237] was against light[^h4237] in three[^h7969] ranks[^h6471]. 
###### 5
And all the doors[^h6607] and posts[^h4201] were square[^h7251], with the windows[^h8260]: and light[^h4237] was against[^h4136] light[^h4237] in three[^h7969] ranks[^h6471]. 
###### 6
And he made[^h6213] a porch[^h197] of pillars[^h5982]; the length[^h753] thereof was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] thereof thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520]: and the porch[^h197] was before[^h6440] them: and the other pillars[^h5982] and the thick beam[^h5646] were before them. 
###### 7
Then he made[^h6213] a porch[^h197] for the throne[^h3678] where he might judge[^h8199], even the porch[^h197] of judgment[^h4941]: and it was covered[^h5603] with cedar[^h730] from one side of the floor[^h7172] to the other[^h7172]. 
###### 8
And his house[^h1004] where he dwelt[^h3427] had another[^h312] court[^h2691] within[^h1004] the porch[^h197], which was of the like work[^h4639]. Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] also an house[^h1004] for Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323], whom he had taken[^h3947] to wife, like unto this porch[^h197].
###### 9
All these were of costly[^h3368] stones[^h68], according to the measures[^h4060] of hewed stones[^h1496], sawed[^h1641] with saws[^h4050], within[^h1004] and without[^h2351], even from the foundation[^h4527] unto the coping[^h2947], and so on the outside[^h2351] toward the great[^h1419] court[^h2691].
###### 10
And the foundation[^h3245] was of costly[^h3368] stones[^h68], even great[^h1419] stones[^h68], stones[^h68] of ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520], and stones[^h68] of eight[^h8083] cubits[^h520].
###### 11
And above[^h4605] were costly[^h3368] stones[^h68], after the measures[^h4060] of hewed stones[^h1496], and cedars[^h730].
###### 12
And the great[^h1419] court[^h2691] round about[^h5439] was with three[^h7969] rows[^h2905] of hewed stones[^h1496], and a row[^h2905] of cedar[^h730] beams[^h3773], both for the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and for the porch[^h197] of the house[^h1004].
###### 13
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971] and fetched[^h3947] Hiram[^h2438] out of Tyre[^h6865].
###### 14
He was a widow's[^h802] [^h490] son[^h1121] of the tribe[^h4294] of Naphtali[^h5321], and his father[^h1] was a man[^h376] of Tyre[^h6876], a worker[^h2790] in brass[^h5178]: and he was filled[^h4390] with wisdom[^h2451], and understanding[^h8394], and cunning[^h1847] to work[^h6213] all works[^h4399] in brass[^h5178]. And he came[^h935] to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010], and wrought[^h6213] all his work[^h4399]. 
###### 15
For he cast[^h6696] two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982] of brass[^h5178], of eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] cubits[^h520] high[^h6967] apiece[^h5982] [^h259]: and a line[^h2339] of twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] cubits[^h520] did compass[^h5437] either[^h8145] of them about[^h5437]. 
###### 16
And he made[^h6213] two[^h8147] chapiters[^h3805] of molten[^h3332] brass[^h5178], to set[^h5414] upon the tops[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982]: the height[^h6967] of the one[^h259] chapiter[^h3805] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520], and the height[^h6967] of the other[^h8145] chapiter[^h3805] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520]:
###### 17
And nets[^h7638] of checker[^h7639] work[^h4639], and wreaths[^h1434] of chain[^h8333] work[^h4639], for the chapiters[^h3805] which were upon the top[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982]; seven[^h7651] for the one[^h259] chapiter[^h3805], and seven[^h7651] for the other[^h8145] chapiter[^h3805].
###### 18
And he made[^h6213] the pillars[^h5982], and two[^h8147] rows[^h2905] round about[^h5439] upon the one[^h259] network[^h7639], to cover[^h3680] the chapiters[^h3805] that were upon the top[^h7218], with pomegranates[^h7416]: and so did[^h6213] he for the other[^h8145] chapiter[^h3805].
###### 19
And the chapiters[^h3805] that were upon the top[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982] were of lily[^h7799] work[^h4639] in the porch[^h197], four[^h702] cubits[^h520].
###### 20
And the chapiters[^h3805] upon the two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982] had pomegranates also above[^h4605], over against[^h5980] the belly[^h990] which was by[^h5676] the network[^h7639]: and the pomegranates[^h7416] were two hundred[^h3967] in rows[^h2905] round about[^h5439] upon the other[^h8145] chapiter[^h3805].
###### 21
And he set up[^h6965] the pillars[^h5982] in the porch[^h197] of the temple[^h1964]: and he set up[^h6965] the right[^h3233] pillar[^h5982], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] thereof Jachin[^h3199]: and he set up[^h6965] the left[^h8042] pillar[^h5982], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] thereof Boaz[^h1162].  
###### 22
And upon the top[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982] was lily[^h7799] work[^h4639]: so was the work[^h4399] of the pillars[^h5982] finished[^h8552].
###### 23
And he made[^h6213] a molten[^h3332] sea[^h3220], ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520] from the one brim[^h8193] to the other[^h8193]: it was round[^h5696] all about[^h5439], and his height[^h6967] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520]: and a line[^h6957] [^h6961] of thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520] did compass[^h5437] it round about[^h5439]. 
###### 24
And under the brim[^h8193] of it round about[^h5439] there were knops[^h6497] compassing[^h5437] it, ten[^h6235] in a cubit[^h520], compassing[^h5362] the sea[^h3220] round about[^h5439]: the knops[^h6497] were cast[^h3333] in two[^h8147] rows[^h2905], when it was cast[^h3332].
###### 25
It stood[^h5975] upon twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] oxen[^h1241], three[^h7969] looking[^h6437] toward the north[^h6828], and three[^h7969] looking[^h6437] toward the west[^h3220], and three[^h7969] looking[^h6437] toward the south[^h5045], and three[^h7969] looking[^h6437] toward the east[^h4217]: and the sea[^h3220] was set above[^h4605] upon them, and all their hinder parts[^h268] were inward[^h1004].
###### 26
And it was an hand breadth[^h2947] thick[^h5672], and the brim[^h8193] thereof was wrought[^h4639] like the brim[^h8193] of a cup[^h3563], with flowers[^h6525] of lilies[^h7799]: it contained[^h3557] two thousand[^h505] baths[^h1324].
###### 27
And he made[^h6213] ten[^h6235] bases[^h4350] of brass[^h5178]; four[^h702] cubits[^h520] was the length[^h753] of one[^h259] base[^h4350], and four[^h702] cubits[^h520] the breadth[^h7341] thereof, and three[^h7969] cubits[^h520] the height[^h6967] of it.
###### 28
And the work[^h4639] of the bases[^h4350] was on this manner: they had borders[^h4526], and the borders[^h4526] were between the ledges[^h7948]:
###### 29
And on the borders[^h4526] that were between the ledges[^h7948] were lions[^h738], oxen[^h1241], and cherubims[^h3742]: and upon the ledges[^h7948] there was a base[^h3653] above[^h4605]: and beneath the lions[^h738] and oxen[^h1241] were certain additions[^h3914] made of thin[^h4174] work[^h4639].
###### 30
And every[^h259] base[^h4350] had four[^h702] brasen[^h5178] wheels[^h212], and plates[^h5633] of brass[^h5178]: and the four[^h702] corners[^h6471] thereof had undersetters[^h3802]: under the laver[^h3595] were undersetters[^h3802] molten[^h3332], at the side[^h5676] of every[^h376] addition[^h3914].
###### 31
And the mouth[^h6310] of it within[^h1004] the chapiter[^h3805] and above[^h4605] was a cubit[^h520]: but the mouth[^h6310] thereof was round[^h5696] after the work[^h4639] of the base[^h3653], a cubit[^h520] and an half[^h2677]: and also upon the mouth[^h6310] of it were gravings[^h4734] with their borders[^h4526], foursquare[^h7251], not round[^h5696].
###### 32
And under[^h8478] the borders[^h4526] were four[^h702] wheels[^h212]; and the axletrees[^h3027] of the wheels[^h212] were joined to the base[^h4350]: and the height[^h6967] of a[^h259] wheel[^h212] was a cubit[^h520] and half[^h2677] a cubit[^h520]. 
###### 33
And the work[^h4639] of the wheels[^h212] was like the work[^h4639] of a chariot[^h4818] wheel[^h212]: their axletrees[^h3027], and their naves[^h1354], and their felloes[^h2839], and their spokes[^h2840], were all molten[^h3332].
###### 34
And there were four[^h702] undersetters[^h3802] to the four[^h702] corners[^h6438] of one[^h259] base[^h4350]: and the undersetters[^h3802] were of the very base[^h4350] itself.
###### 35
And in the top[^h7218] of the base[^h4350] was there a round[^h5696] compass[^h5439] of half[^h2677] a cubit[^h520] high[^h6967]: and on the top[^h7218] of the base[^h4350] the ledges[^h3027] thereof and the borders[^h4526] thereof were of the same.
###### 36
For on the plates[^h3871] of the ledges[^h3027] thereof, and on the borders[^h4526] thereof, he graved[^h6605] cherubims[^h3742], lions[^h738], and palm trees[^h8561], according to the proportion[^h4626] of every one[^h376], and additions[^h3914] round about[^h5439]. 
###### 37
After this manner he made[^h6213] the ten[^h6235] bases[^h4350]: all of them had one[^h259] casting[^h4165], one[^h259] measure[^h4060], and one[^h259] size[^h7095].
###### 38
Then made[^h6213] he ten[^h6235] lavers[^h3595] of brass[^h5178]: one[^h259] laver[^h3595] contained[^h3557] forty[^h705] baths[^h1324]: and every[^h259] laver[^h3595] was four[^h702] cubits[^h520]: and upon every one[^h259] of the ten[^h6235] bases[^h4350] one[^h259] laver[^h3595].
###### 39
And he put[^h5414] five[^h2568] bases[^h4350] on the right[^h3225] side[^h3802] of the house[^h1004], and five[^h2568] on the left[^h8040] side[^h3802] of the house[^h1004]: and he set[^h5414] the sea[^h3220] on the right[^h3233] side[^h3802] of the house[^h1004] eastward[^h6924] over against[^h4136] the south[^h5045]. 
###### 40
And Hiram[^h2438] made[^h6213] the lavers[^h3595], and the shovels[^h3257], and the basons[^h4219]. So Hiram[^h2438] made[^h3615] an end of doing[^h6213] all the work[^h4399] that he made[^h6213] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: 
###### 41
The two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982], and the two bowls[^h1543] of the chapiters[^h3805] that were on the top[^h7218] of the two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982]; and the two[^h8147] networks[^h7639], to cover[^h3680] the two[^h8147] bowls[^h1543] of the chapiters[^h3805] which were upon the top[^h7218] of the pillars[^h5982];
###### 42
And four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] pomegranates[^h7416] for the two[^h8147] networks[^h7639], even two[^h8147] rows[^h2905] of pomegranates[^h7416] for one[^h259] network[^h7639], to cover[^h3680] the two[^h8147] bowls[^h1543] of the chapiters[^h3805] that were upon[^h6440] the pillars[^h5982]; 
###### 43
And the ten[^h6235] bases[^h4350], and ten[^h6235] lavers[^h3595] on the bases[^h4350];
###### 44
And one[^h259] sea[^h3220], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] oxen[^h1241] under the sea[^h3220];
###### 45
And the pots[^h5518], and the shovels[^h3257], and the basons[^h4219]: and all these vessels[^h3627], which Hiram[^h2438] made[^h6213] to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], were of bright[^h4178] brass[^h5178]. 
###### 46
In the plain[^h3603] of Jordan[^h3383] did the king[^h4428] cast[^h3332] them, in the clay[^h4568] ground[^h127] between Succoth[^h5523] and Zarthan[^h6891]. 
###### 47
And Solomon[^h8010] left[^h3240] all the vessels[^h3627] unweighed, because they were exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] many[^h7230]: neither was the weight[^h4948] of the brass[^h5178] found out[^h2713].  
###### 48
And Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] all the vessels[^h3627] that pertained unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: the altar[^h4196] of gold[^h2091], and the table[^h7979] of gold[^h2091], whereupon the shewbread[^h3899] [^h6440] was,
###### 49
And the candlesticks[^h4501] of pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091], five[^h2568] on the right[^h3225] side, and five[^h2568] on the left[^h8040], before[^h6440] the oracle[^h1687], with the flowers[^h6525], and the lamps[^h5216], and the tongs[^h4457] of gold[^h2091],
###### 50
And the bowls[^h5592], and the snuffers[^h4212], and the basons[^h4219], and the spoons[^h3709], and the censers[^h4289] of pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091]; and the hinges[^h6596] of gold[^h2091], both for the doors[^h1817] of the inner[^h6442] house[^h1004], the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place, and for the doors[^h1817] of the house[^h1004], to wit, of the temple[^h1964]. 
###### 51
So was ended[^h7999] all the work[^h4399] that king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] made[^h6213] for the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And Solomon[^h8010] brought in[^h935] the things which David[^h1732] his father[^h1] had dedicated[^h6944]; even the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the vessels[^h3627], did he put[^h5414] among the treasures[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
And Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664], who was of the inhabitants[^h8453] of Gilead[^h1568], said[^h559] unto Ahab[^h256], As the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] liveth[^h2416], before[^h6440] whom I stand[^h5975], there shall not be dew[^h2919] nor rain[^h4306] these years[^h8141], but according[^h6310] to my word[^h1697]. 
###### 2
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto him, saying[^h559],
###### 3
Get[^h3212] thee hence, and turn[^h6437] thee eastward[^h6924], and hide[^h5641] thyself by the brook[^h5158] Cherith[^h3747], that is before[^h6440] Jordan[^h3383].
###### 4
And it shall be, that thou shalt drink[^h8354] of the brook[^h5158]; and I have commanded[^h6680] the ravens[^h6158] to feed[^h3557] thee there.
###### 5
So he went[^h3212] and did[^h6213] according unto the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]: for he went[^h3212] and dwelt[^h3427] by the brook[^h5158] Cherith[^h3747], that is before[^h6440] Jordan[^h3383].
###### 6
And the ravens[^h6158] brought[^h935] him bread[^h3899] and flesh[^h1320] in the morning[^h1242], and bread[^h3899] and flesh[^h1320] in the evening[^h6153]; and he drank[^h8354] of the brook[^h5158].
###### 7
And it came to pass after[^h7093] a while[^h3117], that the brook[^h5158] dried up[^h3001], because there had been no rain[^h1653] in the land[^h776]. 
###### 8
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto him, saying[^h559],
###### 9
Arise[^h6965], get[^h3212] thee to Zarephath[^h6886], which belongeth to Zidon[^h6721], and dwell[^h3427] there: behold, I have commanded[^h6680] a widow[^h490] woman[^h802] there to sustain[^h3557] thee. 
###### 10
So he arose[^h6965] and went[^h3212] to Zarephath[^h6886]. And when he came[^h935] to the gate[^h6607] of the city[^h5892], behold, the widow[^h490] woman[^h802] was there gathering[^h7197] of sticks[^h6086]: and he called[^h7121] to her, and said[^h559], Fetch[^h3947] me, I pray thee, a little[^h4592] water[^h4325] in a vessel[^h3627], that I may drink[^h8354].
###### 11
And as she was going[^h3212] to fetch[^h3947] it, he called[^h7121] to her, and said[^h559], Bring[^h3947] me, I pray thee, a morsel[^h6595] of bread[^h3899] in thine hand[^h3027].
###### 12
And she said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] liveth[^h2416], I have[^h3426] not a cake[^h4580], but an handful[^h4393] [^h3709] of meal[^h7058] in a barrel[^h3537], and a little[^h4592] oil[^h8081] in a cruse[^h6835]: and, behold, I am gathering[^h7197] two[^h8147] sticks[^h6086], that I may go in[^h935] and dress[^h6213] it for me and my son[^h1121], that we may eat[^h398] it, and die[^h4191].
###### 13
And Elijah[^h452] said[^h559] unto her, Fear[^h3372] not; go[^h935] and do[^h6213] as thou hast said[^h1697]: but make[^h6213] me thereof[^h8033] a little[^h6996] cake[^h5692] first[^h7223], and bring[^h3318] it unto me, and after[^h314] make[^h6213] for thee and for thy son[^h1121].
###### 14
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], The barrel[^h3537] of meal[^h7058] shall not waste[^h3615], neither shall the cruse[^h6835] of oil[^h8081] fail[^h2637], until the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] sendeth[^h5414] rain[^h1653] upon[^h6440] the earth[^h127]. 
###### 15
And she went[^h3212] and did[^h6213] according to the saying[^h1697] of Elijah[^h452]: and she, and he, and her house[^h1004], did eat[^h398] many days[^h3117]. 
###### 16
And the barrel[^h3537] of meal[^h7058] wasted[^h3615] not, neither did the cruse[^h6835] of oil[^h8081] fail[^h2638], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] Elijah[^h452]. 
###### 17
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that the son[^h1121] of the woman[^h802], the mistress[^h1172] of the house[^h1004], fell sick[^h2470]; and his sickness[^h2483] was so[^h3966] sore[^h2389], that there was no breath[^h5397] left[^h3498] in him.
###### 18
And she said[^h559] unto Elijah[^h452], What have I to do with thee, O thou man[^h376] of God[^h430]? art thou come[^h935] unto me to call[^h2142] my sin[^h5771] to remembrance[^h2142], and to slay[^h4191] my son[^h1121]?
###### 19
And he said[^h559] unto her, Give[^h5414] me thy son[^h1121]. And he took[^h3947] him out of her bosom[^h2436], and carried him up[^h5927] into a loft[^h5944], where he abode[^h3427], and laid[^h7901] him upon his own bed[^h4296].
###### 20
And he cried[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], hast thou also brought evil[^h7489] upon the widow[^h490] with whom I sojourn[^h1481], by slaying[^h4191] her son[^h1121]?
###### 21
And he stretched[^h4058] himself upon the child[^h3206] three[^h7969] times[^h6471], and cried[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], I pray thee, let this child's[^h3206] soul[^h5315] come[^h7725] into him[^h7130] again[^h7725].  
###### 22
And the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of Elijah[^h452]; and the soul[^h5315] of the child[^h3206] came[^h7725] into him[^h7130] again[^h7725], and he revived[^h2421].
###### 23
And Elijah[^h452] took[^h3947] the child[^h3206], and brought him down[^h3381] out of the chamber[^h5944] into the house[^h1004], and delivered[^h5414] him unto his mother[^h517]: and Elijah[^h452] said[^h559], See[^h7200], thy son[^h1121] liveth[^h2416].
###### 24
And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] to Elijah[^h452], Now by this[^h2088] I know[^h3045] that thou art a man[^h376] of God[^h430], and that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] in thy mouth[^h6310] is truth[^h571].

###### 1
And they continued[^h3427] three[^h7969] years[^h8141] without war[^h4421] between Syria[^h758] and Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And it came to pass in the third[^h7992] year[^h8141], that Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] came down[^h3381] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Know[^h3045] ye that Ramoth[^h7433] in Gilead[^h1568] is ours, and we be still[^h2814], and take[^h3947] it not out of the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758]? 
###### 4
And he said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Wilt thou go[^h3212] with me to battle[^h4421] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]? And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559] to the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], I am as thou[^h3644] art, my people[^h5971] as thy people[^h5971], my horses[^h5483] as thy horses[^h5483].
###### 5
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], Enquire[^h1875], I pray thee, at the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] to day[^h3117].
###### 6
Then the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] gathered[^h6908] the prophets[^h5030] together[^h6908], about four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376], and said[^h559] unto them, Shall I go[^h3212] against Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568] to battle[^h4421], or shall I forbear[^h2308]? And they said[^h559], Go up[^h5927]; for the Lord[^h136] shall deliver[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428].
###### 7
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], Is there not here a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068] besides[^h5750], that we might enquire[^h1875] of him?
###### 8
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], There is yet one[^h259] man[^h376], Micaiah[^h4321] the son[^h1121] of Imlah[^h3229], by whom we may enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068]: but I hate[^h8130] him; for he doth not prophesy[^h5012] good[^h2896] concerning me, but evil[^h7451]. And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] said[^h559], Let not the king[^h4428] say[^h559] so.
###### 9
Then the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] called[^h7121] an[^h259] officer[^h5631], and said[^h559], Hasten[^h4116] hither Micaiah[^h4321] the son[^h1121] of Imlah[^h3229]. 
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] sat[^h3427] each[^h376] on his throne[^h3678], having put on[^h3847] their robes[^h899], in a void place[^h1637] in the entrance[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of Samaria[^h8111]; and all the prophets[^h5030] prophesied[^h5012] before[^h6440] them. 
###### 11
And Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Chenaanah[^h3668] made[^h6213] him horns[^h7161] of iron[^h1270]: and he said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], With these shalt thou push[^h5055] the Syrians[^h758], until thou have consumed[^h3615] them.
###### 12
And all the prophets[^h5030] prophesied[^h5012] so, saying[^h559], Go up[^h5927] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568], and prosper[^h6743]: for the LORD[^h3068] shall deliver[^h5414] it into the king's[^h4428] hand[^h3027].
###### 13
And the messenger[^h4397] that was gone[^h1980] to call[^h7121] Micaiah[^h4321] spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], Behold now, the words[^h1697] of the prophets[^h5030] declare good[^h2896] unto the king[^h4428] with one[^h259] mouth[^h6310]: let thy word[^h1697], I pray thee, be like the word[^h1697] of one[^h259] of them, and speak[^h1696] that which is good[^h2896].
###### 14
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], what the LORD[^h3068] saith[^h559] unto me, that will I speak[^h1696].
###### 15
So he came[^h935] to the king[^h4428]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, Micaiah[^h4321], shall we go[^h3212] against Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568] to battle[^h4421], or shall we forbear[^h2308]? And he answered[^h559] him, Go[^h5927], and prosper[^h6743]: for the LORD[^h3068] shall deliver[^h5414] it into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428].
###### 16
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, How many times[^h6471] shall I adjure[^h7650] thee that thou tell[^h1696] me nothing but that which is true[^h571] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 17
And he said[^h559], I saw[^h7200] all Israel[^h3478] scattered[^h6327] upon the hills[^h2022], as sheep[^h6629] that have not a shepherd[^h7462]: and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], These have no master[^h113]: let them return[^h7725] every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004] in peace[^h7965].
###### 18
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Did I not tell[^h559] thee that he would prophesy[^h5012] no good[^h2896] concerning me, but evil[^h7451]?
###### 19
And he said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] thou therefore the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]: I saw[^h7200] the LORD[^h3068] sitting[^h3427] on his throne[^h3678], and all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064] standing[^h5975] by him on his right hand[^h3225] and on his left[^h8040].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Who shall persuade[^h6601] Ahab[^h256], that he may go up[^h5927] and fall[^h5307] at Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568]? And one said[^h559] on this manner[^h3541], and another said[^h559] on that manner[^h3541]. 
###### 21
And there came forth[^h3318] a spirit[^h7307], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], I will persuade[^h6601] him.
###### 22
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Wherewith? And he said[^h559], I will go forth[^h3318], and I will be a lying[^h8267] spirit[^h7307] in the mouth[^h6310] of all his prophets[^h5030]. And he said[^h559], Thou shalt persuade[^h6601] him, and prevail[^h3201] also: go forth[^h3318], and do[^h6213] so.
###### 23
Now therefore, behold, the LORD[^h3068] hath put[^h5414] a lying[^h8267] spirit[^h7307] in the mouth[^h6310] of all these thy prophets[^h5030], and the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] evil[^h7451] concerning thee.
###### 24
But Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Chenaanah[^h3668] went near[^h5066], and smote[^h5221] Micaiah[^h4321] on the cheek[^h3895], and said[^h559], Which way[^h335] went[^h5674] the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] from me to speak[^h1696] unto thee?
###### 25
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], Behold, thou shalt see[^h7200] in that day[^h3117], when thou shalt go[^h935] into an inner[^h2315] chamber[^h2315] to hide[^h2247] thyself. 
###### 26
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Take[^h3947] Micaiah[^h4321], and carry him back[^h7725] unto Amon[^h526] the governor[^h8269] of the city[^h5892], and to Joash[^h3101] the king's[^h4428] son[^h1121];
###### 27
And say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the king[^h4428], Put[^h7760] this fellow in the prison[^h1004] [^h3608], and feed[^h398] him with bread[^h3899] of affliction[^h3906] and with water[^h4325] of affliction[^h3906], until I come[^h935] in peace[^h7965].
###### 28
And Micaiah[^h4321] said[^h559], If thou return[^h7725] at all[^h7725] in peace[^h7965], the LORD[^h3068] hath not spoken[^h1696] by me. And he said[^h559], Hearken[^h8085], O people[^h5971], every one of you.
###### 29
So the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] went up[^h5927] to Ramothgilead[^h7433] [^h1568].
###### 30
And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], I will disguise[^h2664] myself, and enter[^h935] into the battle[^h4421]; but put thou on[^h3847] thy robes[^h899]. And the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] disguised[^h2664] himself, and went[^h935] into the battle[^h4421]. 
###### 31
But the king[^h4428] of Syria[^h758] commanded[^h6680] his thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] captains[^h8269] that had rule over his chariots[^h7393], saying[^h559], Fight[^h3898] neither with small[^h6996] nor great[^h1419], save only with the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 32
And it came to pass, when the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393] saw[^h7200] Jehoshaphat[^h3092], that they said[^h559], Surely it is the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]. And they turned aside[^h5493] to fight[^h3898] against him: and Jehoshaphat[^h3092] cried out[^h2199].
###### 33
And it came to pass, when the captains[^h8269] of the chariots[^h7393] perceived[^h7200] that it was not the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], that they turned back[^h7725] from pursuing[^h310] him.
###### 34
And a certain man[^h376] drew[^h4900] a bow[^h7198] at a venture[^h8537], and smote[^h5221] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] between the joints[^h1694] of the harness[^h8302]: wherefore he said[^h559] unto the driver of his chariot[^h7395], Turn[^h2015] thine hand[^h3027], and carry me out[^h3318] of the host[^h4264]; for I am wounded[^h2470].   
###### 35
And the battle[^h4421] increased[^h5927] that day[^h3117]: and the king[^h4428] was stayed up[^h5975] in his chariot[^h4818] against[^h5227] the Syrians[^h758], and died[^h4191] at even[^h6153]: and the blood[^h1818] ran out[^h3332] of the wound[^h4347] into the midst[^h2436] of the chariot[^h7393].  
###### 36
And there went[^h5674] a proclamation[^h7440] throughout the host[^h4264] about the going down[^h935] of the sun[^h8121], saying[^h559], Every man[^h376] to his city[^h5892], and every man[^h376] to his own country[^h776].
###### 37
So the king[^h4428] died[^h4191], and was brought[^h935] to Samaria[^h8111]; and they buried[^h6912] the king[^h4428] in Samaria[^h8111]. 
###### 38
And one washed[^h7857] the chariot[^h7393] in the pool[^h1295] of Samaria[^h8111]; and the dogs[^h3611] licked up[^h3952] his blood[^h1818]; and they washed[^h7364] his armour[^h2185]; according unto the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which he spake[^h1696].
###### 39
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Ahab[^h256], and all that he did[^h6213], and the ivory[^h8127] house[^h1004] which he made[^h1129], and all the cities[^h5892] that he built[^h1129], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 40
So Ahab[^h256] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1]; and Ahaziah[^h274] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 41
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] the son[^h1121] of Asa[^h609] began to reign[^h4427] over Judah[^h3063] in the fourth[^h702] year[^h8141] of Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 42
Jehoshaphat[^h3092] was thirty[^h7970] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427]; and he reigned[^h4427] twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Azubah[^h5806] the daughter[^h1323] of Shilhi[^h7977].
###### 43
And he walked[^h3212] in all the ways[^h1870] of Asa[^h609] his father[^h1]; he turned not aside[^h5493] from it, doing[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: nevertheless the high places[^h1116] were not taken away[^h5493]; for the people[^h5971] offered[^h2076] and burnt incense[^h6999] yet in the high places[^h1116].
###### 44
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] made peace[^h7999] with the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 45
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092], and his might[^h1369] that he shewed[^h6213], and how he warred[^h3898], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]?
###### 46
And the remnant[^h3499] of the sodomites[^h6945], which remained[^h7604] in the days[^h3117] of his father[^h1] Asa[^h609], he took[^h1197] out of the land[^h776].
###### 47
There was then no king[^h4428] in Edom[^h123]: a deputy[^h5324] was king[^h4428].
###### 48
Jehoshaphat[^h3092] made[^h6213] [^h6240] ships[^h591] of Tharshish[^h8659] to go[^h3212] to Ophir[^h211] for gold[^h2091]: but they went[^h1980] not; for the ships[^h591] were broken[^h7665] at Eziongeber[^h6100]. 
###### 49
Then said[^h559] Ahaziah[^h274] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] unto Jehoshaphat[^h3092], Let my servants[^h5650] go[^h3212] with thy servants[^h5650] in the ships[^h591]. But Jehoshaphat[^h3092] would[^h14] not.
###### 50
And Jehoshaphat[^h3092] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] with his fathers[^h1] in the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732] his father[^h1]: and Jehoram[^h3088] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 51
Ahaziah[^h274] the son[^h1121] of Ahab[^h256] began to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111] the seventeenth[^h7651] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of Jehoshaphat[^h3092] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and reigned[^h4427] two years[^h8141] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 52
And he did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of his father[^h1], and in the way[^h1870] of his mother[^h517], and in the way[^h1870] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398]:
###### 53
For he served[^h5647] Baal[^h1168], and worshipped[^h7812] him, and provoked to anger[^h3707] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], according to all that his father[^h1] had done[^h6213].

###### 1
And it came to pass in the four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and eightieth[^h8084] year[^h8141] after the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were come out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in the fourth[^h7243] year[^h8141] of Solomon's[^h8010] reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478], in the month[^h2320] Zif[^h2099], which is the second[^h8145] month[^h2320], that he began to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 2
And the house[^h1004] which king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] built[^h1129] for the LORD[^h3068], the length[^h753] thereof was threescore[^h8346] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] thereof twenty[^h6242] cubits, and the height[^h6967] thereof thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520].
###### 3
And the porch[^h197] before[^h6440] the temple[^h1964] of the house[^h1004], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] was the length[^h753] thereof, according to the breadth[^h7341] of the house[^h1004]; and ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520] was the breadth[^h7341] thereof before the house[^h1004].
###### 4
And for the house[^h1004] he made[^h6213] windows[^h2474] of narrow[^h331] lights[^h8261]. 
###### 5
And against the wall[^h7023] of the house[^h1004] he built[^h1129] chambers[^h3326] [^h3326] round about[^h5439], against the walls[^h7023] of the house[^h1004] round about[^h5439], both of the temple[^h1964] and of the oracle[^h1687]: and he made[^h6213] chambers[^h6763] round about[^h5439]:   
###### 6
The nethermost[^h8481] chamber[^h3326] [^h3326] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341], and the middle[^h8484] was six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341], and the third[^h7992] was seven[^h7651] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341]: for without in the wall of[^h2351] the house[^h1004] he made[^h5414] narrowed rests[^h4052] round about[^h5439], that the beams should not be fastened[^h270] in the walls[^h7023] of the house[^h1004]. 
###### 7
And the house[^h1004], when it was in building[^h1129], was built[^h1129] of stone[^h68] made ready[^h8003] before it was brought[^h4551] thither: so that there was neither hammer[^h4717] nor axe[^h1631] nor any tool[^h3627] of iron[^h1270] heard[^h8085] in the house[^h1004], while it was in building[^h1129].
###### 8
The door[^h6607] for the middle[^h8484] chamber[^h6763] was in the right[^h3233] side[^h3802] of the house[^h1004]: and they went up[^h5927] with winding stairs[^h3883] into the middle[^h8484] chamber, and out of the middle[^h8484] into the third[^h7992]. 
###### 9
So he built[^h1129] the house[^h1004], and finished[^h3615] it; and covered[^h5603] the house[^h1004] with beams[^h1356] and boards[^h7713] of cedar[^h730]. 
###### 10
And then he built[^h1129] chambers[^h3326] [^h3326] against all the house[^h1004], five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] high[^h6967]: and they rested[^h270] on the house[^h1004] with timber[^h6086] of cedar[^h730].
###### 11
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Solomon[^h8010], saying[^h559],
###### 12
Concerning this house[^h1004] which thou art in building[^h1129], if thou wilt walk[^h3212] in my statutes[^h2708], and execute[^h6213] my judgments[^h4941], and keep[^h8104] all my commandments[^h4687] to walk[^h3212] in them; then will I perform[^h6965] my word[^h1697] with thee, which I spake[^h1696] unto David[^h1732] thy father[^h1]:
###### 13
And I will dwell[^h7931] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and will not forsake[^h5800] my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
So Solomon[^h8010] built[^h1129] the house[^h1004], and finished[^h3615] it.
###### 15
And he built[^h1129] the walls[^h7023] of the house[^h1004] within[^h1004] with boards[^h6763] of cedar[^h730], both the floor[^h7172] of the house[^h1004], and the walls[^h7023] of the cieling[^h5604]: and he covered[^h6823] them on the inside[^h1004] with wood[^h6086], and covered[^h6823] the floor[^h7172] of the house[^h1004] with planks[^h6763] of fir[^h1265]. 
###### 16
And he built[^h1129] twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] on the sides[^h3411] of the house[^h1004], both[^h4480] the floor[^h7172] and the walls[^h7023] with boards[^h6763] of cedar[^h730]: he even built[^h1129] them for it within[^h1004], even for the oracle[^h1687], even for the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place.
###### 17
And the house[^h1004], that is, the temple[^h1964] before[^h3942] it, was forty[^h705] cubits[^h520] long.
###### 18
And the cedar[^h730] of the house[^h1004] within[^h6441] was carved[^h4734] with knops[^h6497] and open[^h6362] flowers[^h6731]: all was cedar[^h730]; there was no stone[^h68] seen[^h7200].  
###### 19
And the oracle[^h1687] he prepared[^h3559] in[^h8432] the house[^h1004] within[^h6441], to set[^h5414] there the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
And the oracle[^h1687] in the forepart[^h6440] was twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] in length[^h753], and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] in breadth[^h7341], and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] in the height[^h6967] thereof: and he overlaid[^h6823] it with pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091]; and so covered[^h6823] the altar[^h4196] which was of cedar[^h730]. 
###### 21
So Solomon[^h8010] overlaid[^h6823] the house[^h1004] within[^h6441] with pure[^h5462] gold[^h2091]: and he made a partition[^h5674] by the chains[^h7572] [^h7572] of gold[^h2091] before[^h6440] the oracle[^h1687]; and he overlaid[^h6823] it with gold[^h2091].
###### 22
And the whole house[^h1004] he overlaid[^h6823] with gold[^h2091], until he had finished[^h8552] all the house[^h1004]: also the whole altar[^h4196] that was by the oracle[^h1687] he overlaid[^h6823] with gold[^h2091].
###### 23
And within the oracle[^h1687] he made[^h6213] two[^h8147] cherubims[^h3742] of olive[^h8081] tree[^h6086], each ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520] high[^h6967]. 
###### 24
And five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] was the one[^h259] wing[^h3671] of the cherub[^h3742], and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] the other[^h8145] wing[^h3671] of the cherub[^h3742]: from the uttermost part[^h7098] of the one wing[^h3671] unto the uttermost part[^h7098] of the other[^h3671] were ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520].
###### 25
And the other[^h8145] cherub[^h3742] was ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520]: both[^h8147] the cherubims[^h3742] were of one[^h259] measure[^h4060] and one[^h259] size[^h7095].
###### 26
The height[^h6967] of the one[^h259] cherub[^h3742] was ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520], and so was it of the other[^h8145] cherub[^h3742].
###### 27
And he set[^h5414] the cherubims[^h3742] within[^h8432] the inner[^h6442] house[^h1004]: and they stretched forth[^h6566] the wings[^h3671] of the cherubims[^h3742], so that the wing[^h3671] of the one[^h259] touched[^h5060] the one wall[^h7023], and the wing[^h3671] of the other[^h8145] cherub[^h3742] touched[^h5060] the other[^h8145] wall[^h7023]; and their wings[^h3671] touched[^h5060] one[^h3671] another[^h3671] in the midst[^h8432] of the house[^h1004]. 
###### 28
And he overlaid[^h6823] the cherubims[^h3742] with gold[^h2091].
###### 29
And he carved[^h7049] all the walls[^h7023] of the house[^h1004] round about[^h4524] with carved[^h6603] figures[^h4734] of cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561] and open[^h6362] flowers[^h6731], within[^h6441] and without[^h2435]. 
###### 30
And the floor[^h7172] of the house[^h1004] he overlaid[^h6823] with gold[^h2091], within[^h6441] and without[^h2435].
###### 31
And for the entering[^h6607] of the oracle[^h1687] he made[^h6213] doors[^h1817] of olive[^h8081] tree[^h6086]: the lintel[^h352] and side posts[^h4201] were a fifth part[^h2549] of the wall. 
###### 32
The two[^h8147] doors[^h1817] also were of olive[^h8081] tree[^h6086]; and he carved[^h7049] upon them carvings[^h4734] of cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561] and open[^h6362] flowers[^h6731], and overlaid[^h6823] them with gold[^h2091], and spread[^h7286] gold[^h2091] upon the cherubims[^h3742], and upon the palm trees[^h8561].  
###### 33
So also made[^h6213] he for the door[^h6607] of the temple[^h1964] posts[^h4201] of olive[^h8081] tree[^h6086], a fourth part[^h7243] of the wall. 
###### 34
And the two[^h8147] doors[^h1817] were of fir[^h1265] tree[^h6086]: the two[^h8147] leaves[^h6763] of the one[^h259] door[^h1817] were folding[^h1550], and the two[^h8147] leaves[^h7050] of the other[^h8145] door[^h1817] were folding[^h1550].
###### 35
And he carved[^h7049] thereon cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561] and open[^h6362] flowers[^h6731]: and covered[^h6823] them with gold[^h2091] fitted[^h3474] upon the carved work[^h2707].
###### 36
And he built[^h1129] the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] with three[^h7969] rows[^h2905] of hewed stone[^h1496], and a row[^h2905] of cedar[^h730] beams[^h3773].
###### 37
In the fourth[^h7243] year[^h8141] was the foundation[^h3245] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] laid[^h3245], in the month[^h3391] Zif[^h2099]:
###### 38
And in the eleventh[^h259] [^h6240] year[^h8141], in the month[^h3391] Bul[^h945], which is the eighth[^h8066] month[^h2320], was the house[^h1004] finished[^h3615] throughout all the parts[^h1697] thereof, and according to all the fashion[^h4941] of it. So was he seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] in building[^h1129] it.

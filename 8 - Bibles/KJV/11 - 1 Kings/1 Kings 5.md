###### 1
And Hiram[^h2438] king[^h4428] of Tyre[^h6865] sent[^h7971] his servants[^h5650] unto Solomon[^h8010]; for he had heard[^h8085] that they had anointed[^h4886] him king[^h4428] in the room of his father[^h1]: for Hiram[^h2438] was ever[^h3117] a lover[^h157] of David[^h1732].
###### 2
And Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971] to Hiram[^h2438], saying[^h559],
###### 3
Thou knowest[^h3045] how that David[^h1732] my father[^h1] could[^h3201] not build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430] for[^h6440] the wars[^h4421] which were about him on every side[^h5437], until the LORD[^h3068] put[^h5414] them under the soles[^h3709] of his feet[^h7272].
###### 4
But now the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430] hath given me rest[^h5117] on every side[^h5439], so that there is neither adversary[^h7854] nor evil[^h7451] occurrent[^h6294].
###### 5
And, behold, I purpose[^h559] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], as the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto David[^h1732] my father[^h1], saying[^h559], Thy son[^h1121], whom I will set[^h5414] upon thy throne[^h3678] in thy room, he shall build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto my name[^h8034]. 
###### 6
Now therefore command[^h6680] thou that they hew[^h3772] me cedar trees[^h730] out of Lebanon[^h3844]; and my servants[^h5650] shall be with thy servants[^h5650]: and unto thee will I give[^h5414] hire[^h7939] for thy servants[^h5650] according to all that thou shalt appoint[^h559]: for thou knowest[^h3045] that there is not among us any[^h376] that can skill[^h3045] to hew[^h3772] timber[^h6086] like unto the Sidonians[^h6722]. 
###### 7
And it came to pass, when Hiram[^h2438] heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of Solomon[^h8010], that he rejoiced[^h8055] greatly[^h3966], and said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] this day[^h3117], which hath given[^h5414] unto David[^h1732] a wise[^h2450] son[^h1121] over this great[^h7227] people[^h5971].
###### 8
And Hiram[^h2438] sent[^h7971] to Solomon[^h8010], saying[^h559], I have considered[^h8085] the things which thou sentest[^h7971] to me for: and I will do[^h6213] all thy desire[^h2656] concerning timber[^h6086] of cedar[^h730], and concerning timber[^h6086] of fir[^h1265]. 
###### 9
My servants[^h5650] shall bring them down[^h3381] from Lebanon[^h3844] unto the sea[^h3220]: and I will convey[^h7760] them by sea[^h3220] in floats[^h1702] unto the place[^h4725] that thou shalt appoint[^h7971] me, and will cause them to be discharged[^h5310] there, and thou shalt receive[^h5375] them: and thou shalt accomplish[^h6213] my desire[^h2656], in giving[^h5414] food[^h3899] for my household[^h1004]. 
###### 10
So Hiram[^h2438] gave[^h5414] Solomon[^h8010] cedar[^h730] trees[^h6086] and fir[^h1265] trees[^h6086] according to all his desire[^h2656].
###### 11
And Solomon[^h8010] gave[^h5414] Hiram[^h2438] twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] measures[^h3734] of wheat[^h2406] for food[^h4361] to his household[^h1004], and twenty[^h6242] measures[^h3734] of pure[^h3795] oil[^h8081]: thus gave[^h5414] Solomon[^h8010] to Hiram[^h2438] year[^h8141] by year[^h8141]. 
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] Solomon[^h8010] wisdom[^h2451], as he promised[^h1696] him: and there was peace[^h7965] between Hiram[^h2438] and Solomon[^h8010]; and they two[^h8147] made[^h3772] a league[^h1285] together[^h8147].
###### 13
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] raised[^h5927] a levy[^h4522] out of all Israel[^h3478]; and the levy[^h4522] was thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]. 
###### 14
And he sent[^h7971] them to Lebanon[^h3844], ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] a month[^h2320] by courses[^h2487]: a month[^h2320] they were in Lebanon[^h3844], and two[^h8147] months[^h2320] at home[^h1004]: and Adoniram[^h141] was over the levy[^h4522].
###### 15
And Solomon[^h8010] had threescore and ten[^h7657] thousand[^h505] that bare[^h5375] burdens[^h5449], and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] hewers[^h2672] in the mountains[^h2022];
###### 16
Beside the chief[^h8269] of Solomon's[^h8010] officers[^h5324] which were over the work[^h4399], three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] and three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967], which ruled[^h7287] over the people[^h5971] that wrought[^h6213] in the work[^h4399].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680], and they brought[^h5265] great[^h1419] stones[^h68], costly[^h3368] stones[^h68], and hewed[^h1496] stones[^h68], to lay the foundation[^h3245] of the house[^h1004].
###### 18
And Solomon's[^h8010] builders[^h1129] and Hiram's[^h2438] builders[^h1129] did hew[^h6458] them, and the stonesquarers[^h1382]: so they prepared[^h3559] timber[^h6086] and stones[^h68] to build[^h1129] the house[^h1004].

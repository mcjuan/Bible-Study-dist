###### 1
Then the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Hanani[^h2607] against Baasha[^h1201], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Forasmuch as I exalted[^h7311] thee out of the dust[^h6083], and made[^h5414] thee prince[^h5057] over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]; and thou hast walked[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of Jeroboam[^h3379], and hast made my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398], to provoke me to anger[^h3707] with their sins[^h2403];
###### 3
Behold, I will take away[^h1197] the posterity[^h310] of Baasha[^h1201], and the posterity[^h310] of his house[^h1004]; and will make[^h5414] thy house[^h1004] like the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028].
###### 4
Him that dieth[^h4191] of Baasha[^h1201] in the city[^h5892] shall the dogs[^h3611] eat[^h398]; and him that dieth[^h4191] of his in the fields[^h7704] shall the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064] eat[^h398].
###### 5
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Baasha[^h1201], and what he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 6
So Baasha[^h1201] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in Tirzah[^h8656]: and Elah[^h425] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 7
And also by the hand[^h3027] of the prophet[^h5030] Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Hanani[^h2607] came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] against Baasha[^h1201], and against his house[^h1004], even for all the evil[^h7451] that he did[^h6213] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], in provoking him to anger[^h3707] with the work[^h4639] of his hands[^h3027], in being like the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379]; and because he killed[^h5221] him.
###### 8
In the twenty[^h6242] [^h8141] and sixth[^h8337] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Elah[^h425] the son[^h1121] of Baasha[^h1201] to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Tirzah[^h8656], two years[^h8141].
###### 9
And his servant[^h5650] Zimri[^h2174], captain[^h8269] of half[^h4276] his chariots[^h7393], conspired[^h7194] against him, as he was in Tirzah[^h8656], drinking[^h8354] himself drunk[^h7910] in the house[^h1004] of Arza[^h777] steward of his house[^h1004] in Tirzah[^h8656]. 
###### 10
And Zimri[^h2174] went in[^h935] and smote[^h5221] him, and killed[^h4191] him, in the twenty[^h6242] and seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 11
And it came to pass, when he began to reign[^h4427], as soon as he sat[^h3427] on his throne[^h3678], that he slew[^h5221] all the house[^h1004] of Baasha[^h1201]: he left[^h7604] him not one that pisseth[^h8366] against a wall[^h7023], neither of his kinsfolks[^h1350], nor of his friends[^h7453]. 
###### 12
Thus did Zimri[^h2174] destroy[^h8045] all the house[^h1004] of Baasha[^h1201], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] against Baasha[^h1201] by[^h3027] Jehu[^h3058] the prophet[^h5030], 
###### 13
For all the sins[^h2403] of Baasha[^h1201], and the sins[^h2403] of Elah[^h425] his son[^h1121], by which they sinned[^h2398], and by which they made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398], in provoking the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] to anger[^h3707] with their vanities[^h1892].
###### 14
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Elah[^h425], and all that he did[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 15
In the twenty[^h6242] [^h8141] and seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] did Zimri[^h2174] reign[^h4427] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] in Tirzah[^h8656]. And the people[^h5971] were encamped[^h2583] against Gibbethon[^h1405], which belonged to the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 16
And the people[^h5971] that were encamped[^h2583] heard[^h8085] say[^h559], Zimri[^h2174] hath conspired[^h7194], and hath also slain[^h5221] the king[^h4428]: wherefore all Israel[^h3478] made Omri[^h6018], the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635], king[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] that day[^h3117] in the camp[^h4264].
###### 17
And Omri[^h6018] went up[^h5927] from Gibbethon[^h1405], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, and they besieged[^h6696] Tirzah[^h8656].
###### 18
And it came to pass, when Zimri[^h2174] saw[^h7200] that the city[^h5892] was taken[^h3920], that he went[^h935] into the palace[^h759] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and burnt[^h8313] the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004] over him with fire[^h784], and died[^h4191],
###### 19
For his sins[^h2403] which he sinned[^h2398] in doing[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], in walking[^h3212] in the way[^h1870] of Jeroboam[^h3379], and in his sin[^h2403] which he did[^h6213], to make Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 20
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Zimri[^h2174], and his treason[^h7195] that he wrought[^h7194], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 21
Then were the people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478] divided[^h2505] into two parts[^h2677]: half[^h2677] of the people[^h5971] followed[^h1961] [^h310] Tibni[^h8402] the son[^h1121] of Ginath[^h1527], to make him king[^h4427]; and half[^h2677] followed[^h310] Omri[^h6018].
###### 22
But the people[^h5971] that followed[^h310] Omri[^h6018] prevailed[^h2388] against[^h854] the people[^h5971] that followed[^h310] Tibni[^h8402] the son[^h1121] of Ginath[^h1527]: so Tibni[^h8402] died[^h4191], and Omri[^h6018] reigned[^h4427].
###### 23
In the thirty[^h7970] [^h8141] and first[^h259] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Omri[^h6018] to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] years[^h8141]: six[^h8337] years[^h8141] reigned[^h4427] he in Tirzah[^h8656].
###### 24
And he bought[^h7069] the hill[^h2022] Samaria[^h8111] of Shemer[^h8106] for two talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701], and built[^h1129] on the hill[^h2022], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] which he built[^h1129], after the name[^h8034] of Shemer[^h8106], owner[^h113] of the hill[^h2022], Samaria[^h8111]. 
###### 25
But Omri[^h6018] wrought[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and did worse[^h7489] than all that were before[^h6440] him.
###### 26
For he walked[^h3212] in all the way[^h1870] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], and in his sin[^h2403] wherewith he made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398], to provoke the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] to anger[^h3707] with their vanities[^h1892].
###### 27
Now the rest[^h3499] of the acts[^h1697] of Omri[^h6018] which he did[^h6213], and his might[^h1369] that he shewed[^h6213], are they not written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] of the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 28
So Omri[^h6018] slept[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], and was buried[^h6912] in Samaria[^h8111]: and Ahab[^h256] his son[^h1121] reigned[^h4427] in his stead.
###### 29
And in the thirty[^h7970] [^h8141] and eighth[^h8083] year[^h8141] of Asa[^h609] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] began Ahab[^h256] the son[^h1121] of Omri[^h6018] to reign[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478]: and Ahab[^h256] the son[^h1121] of Omri[^h6018] reigned[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478] in Samaria[^h8111] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141].
###### 30
And Ahab[^h256] the son[^h1121] of Omri[^h6018] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] above all that were before[^h6440] him.
###### 31
And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing[^h7043] for him to walk[^h3212] in the sins[^h2403] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], that he took[^h3947] to wife[^h802] Jezebel[^h348] the daughter[^h1323] of Ethbaal[^h856] king[^h4428] of the Zidonians[^h6722], and went[^h3212] and served[^h5647] Baal[^h1168], and worshipped[^h7812] him. 
###### 32
And he reared up[^h6965] an altar[^h4196] for Baal[^h1168] in the house[^h1004] of Baal[^h1168], which he had built[^h1129] in Samaria[^h8111].
###### 33
And Ahab[^h256] made[^h6213] a grove[^h842]; and Ahab[^h256] did[^h6213] more[^h3254] to provoke the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] to anger[^h3707] than all the kings[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] that were before[^h6440] him.
###### 34
In his days[^h3117] did Hiel[^h2419] the Bethelite[^h1017] build[^h1129] Jericho[^h3405]: he laid the foundation[^h3245] thereof in Abiram[^h48] his firstborn[^h1060], and set up[^h5324] the gates[^h1817] thereof in his youngest[^h6810] son Segub[^h7687], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126].

###### 1
Then Solomon[^h8010] assembled[^h6950] the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and all the heads[^h7218] of the tribes[^h4294], the chief[^h5387] of the fathers[^h1] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], unto king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] in Jerusalem[^h3389], that they might bring up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] out of the city[^h5892] of David[^h1732], which is Zion[^h6726]. 
###### 2
And all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] assembled[^h6950] themselves unto king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] at the feast[^h2282] in the month[^h3391] Ethanim[^h388], which is the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320].
###### 3
And all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935], and the priests[^h3548] took up[^h5375] the ark[^h727].
###### 4
And they brought up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and all the holy[^h6944] vessels[^h3627] that were in the tabernacle[^h168], even those did the priests[^h3548] and the Levites[^h3881] bring up[^h5927].
###### 5
And king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010], and all the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478], that were assembled[^h3259] unto him, were with him before[^h6440] the ark[^h727], sacrificing[^h2076] sheep[^h6629] and oxen[^h1241], that could not be told[^h5608] nor numbered[^h4487] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 6
And the priests[^h3548] brought in[^h935] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] unto his place[^h4725], into the oracle[^h1687] of the house[^h1004], to the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place, even under the wings[^h3671] of the cherubims[^h3742].
###### 7
For the cherubims[^h3742] spread forth[^h6566] their two wings[^h3671] over the place[^h4725] of the ark[^h727], and the cherubims[^h3742] covered[^h5526] the ark[^h727] and the staves[^h905] thereof above[^h4605].
###### 8
And they drew out[^h748] the staves[^h905], that the ends[^h7218] of the staves[^h905] were seen out[^h7200] in the holy[^h6944] place before[^h6440] the oracle[^h1687], and they were not seen[^h7200] without[^h2351]: and there they are unto this day[^h3117].  
###### 9
There was nothing in the ark[^h727] save[^h7535] the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68], which Moses[^h4872] put[^h3240] there at Horeb[^h2722], when the LORD[^h3068] made[^h3772] a covenant with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], when they came out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 10
And it came to pass, when the priests[^h3548] were come out[^h3318] of the holy[^h6944] place, that the cloud[^h6051] filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068],
###### 11
So that the priests[^h3548] could[^h3201] not stand[^h5975] to minister[^h8334] because[^h6440] of the cloud[^h6051]: for the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] had filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 12
Then spake[^h559] Solomon[^h8010], The LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] that he would dwell[^h7931] in the thick darkness[^h6205].
###### 13
I have surely[^h1129] built[^h1129] thee an house[^h1004] to dwell in[^h2073], a settled place[^h4349] for thee to abide in[^h3427] for ever[^h5769].
###### 14
And the king[^h4428] turned[^h5437] his face[^h6440] about[^h5437], and blessed[^h1288] all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478]: (and all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478] stood[^h5975];)
###### 15
And he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], which spake[^h1696] with his mouth[^h6310] unto David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and hath with his hand[^h3027] fulfilled[^h4390] it, saying[^h559],
###### 16
Since the day[^h3117] that I brought forth[^h3318] my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] out of Egypt[^h4714], I chose[^h977] no city[^h5892] out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004], that my name[^h8034] might be therein; but I chose[^h977] David[^h1732] to be over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478].
###### 17
And it was in the heart[^h3824] of David[^h1732] my father[^h1] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732] my father[^h1], Whereas[^h3282] [^h834] it was in thine heart[^h3824] to build[^h1129] an house[^h1004] unto my name[^h8034], thou didst well[^h2895] that it was in thine heart[^h3824].
###### 19
Nevertheless[^h7535] thou shalt not build[^h1129] the house[^h1004]; but thy son[^h1121] that shall come forth out[^h3318] of thy loins[^h2504], he shall build[^h1129] the house[^h1004] unto my name[^h8034].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] hath performed[^h6965] his word[^h1697] that he spake[^h1696], and I am risen up[^h6965] in the room of David[^h1732] my father[^h1], and sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478], as the LORD[^h3068] promised[^h1696], and have built[^h1129] an house[^h1004] for the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 21
And I have set[^h7760] there a place[^h4725] for the ark[^h727], wherein is the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], which he made[^h3772] with our fathers[^h1], when he brought them out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 22
And Solomon[^h8010] stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] in the presence of[^h5048] all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], and spread forth[^h6566] his hands[^h3709] toward heaven[^h8064]:
###### 23
And he said[^h559], LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], there is no God[^h430] like thee, in heaven[^h8064] above[^h4605], or on earth[^h776] beneath, who keepest[^h8104] covenant[^h1285] and mercy[^h2617] with thy servants[^h5650] that walk[^h1980] before[^h6440] thee with all their heart[^h3820]:
###### 24
Who hast kept[^h8104] with thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1] that thou promisedst[^h1696] him: thou spakest[^h1696] also with thy mouth[^h6310], and hast fulfilled[^h4390] it with thine hand[^h3027], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 25
Therefore now, LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], keep[^h8104] with thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1] that thou promisedst[^h1696] him, saying[^h559], There shall not fail[^h3772] thee a man[^h376] in my sight[^h6440] to sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of Israel[^h3478]; so[^h7535] that thy children[^h1121] take heed[^h8104] to their way[^h1870], that they walk[^h3212] before[^h6440] me as thou hast walked[^h1980] before[^h6440] me.  
###### 26
And now, O God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], let thy word[^h1697], I pray thee, be verified[^h539], which thou spakest[^h1696] unto thy servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] my father[^h1].
###### 27
But will God[^h430] indeed[^h552] dwell[^h3427] on the earth[^h776]? behold, the heaven[^h8064] and heaven[^h8064] of heavens[^h8064] cannot contain[^h3557] thee; how much less[^h637] this house[^h1004] that I have builded[^h1129]?
###### 28
Yet have thou respect[^h6437] unto the prayer[^h8605] of thy servant[^h5650], and to his supplication[^h8467], O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], to hearken[^h8085] unto the cry[^h7440] and to the prayer[^h8605], which thy servant[^h5650] prayeth[^h6419] before[^h6440] thee to day[^h3117]:
###### 29
That thine eyes[^h5869] may be open[^h6605] toward this house[^h1004] night[^h3915] and day[^h3117], even toward the place[^h4725] of which thou hast said[^h559], My name[^h8034] shall be there: that thou mayest hearken[^h8085] unto the prayer[^h8605] which thy servant[^h5650] shall make[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725]. 
###### 30
And hearken[^h8085] thou to the supplication[^h8467] of thy servant[^h5650], and of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], when they shall pray[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725]: and hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064] thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4725]: and when thou hearest[^h8085], forgive[^h5545]. 
###### 31
If any man[^h376] trespass[^h2398] against his neighbour[^h7453], and an oath[^h423] be laid[^h5375] upon him to cause him to swear[^h422], and the oath[^h423] come[^h935] before[^h6440] thine altar[^h4196] in this house[^h1004]: 
###### 32
Then hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064], and do[^h6213], and judge[^h8199] thy servants[^h5650], condemning[^h7561] the wicked[^h7563], to bring[^h5414] his way[^h1870] upon his head[^h7218]; and justifying[^h6663] the righteous[^h6662], to give[^h5414] him according to his righteousness[^h6666].
###### 33
When thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] be smitten down[^h5062] before[^h6440] the enemy[^h341], because they have sinned[^h2398] against thee, and shall turn again[^h7725] to thee, and confess[^h3034] thy name[^h8034], and pray[^h6419], and make supplication[^h2603] unto thee in this house[^h1004]: 
###### 34
Then hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064], and forgive[^h5545] the sin[^h2403] of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and bring them again[^h7725] unto the land[^h127] which thou gavest[^h5414] unto their fathers[^h1].
###### 35
When heaven[^h8064] is shut up[^h6113], and there is no rain[^h4306], because they have sinned[^h2398] against thee; if they pray[^h6419] toward this place[^h4725], and confess[^h3034] thy name[^h8034], and turn[^h7725] from their sin[^h2403], when thou afflictest[^h6031] them:
###### 36
Then hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064], and forgive[^h5545] the sin[^h2403] of thy servants[^h5650], and of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], that thou teach[^h3384] them the good[^h2896] way[^h1870] wherein they should walk[^h3212], and give[^h5414] rain[^h4306] upon thy land[^h776], which thou hast given[^h5414] to thy people[^h5971] for an inheritance[^h5159].
###### 37
If there be in the land[^h776] famine[^h7458], if there be pestilence[^h1698], blasting[^h7711], mildew[^h3420], locust[^h697], or if there be caterpiller[^h2625]; if their enemy[^h341] besiege[^h6887] them in the land[^h776] of their cities[^h8179]; whatsoever plague[^h5061], whatsoever sickness[^h4245] there be; 
###### 38
What prayer[^h8605] and supplication[^h8467] soever be made by any man[^h120], or by all thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], which shall know[^h3045] every man[^h376] the plague[^h5061] of his own heart[^h3824], and spread forth[^h6566] his hands[^h3709] toward this house[^h1004]:
###### 39
Then hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064] thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], and forgive[^h5545], and do[^h6213], and give[^h5414] to every man[^h376] according to his ways[^h1870], whose heart[^h3824] thou knowest[^h3045]; (for thou, even thou only, knowest[^h3045] the hearts[^h3824] of all the children[^h1121] of men[^h120];)
###### 40
That they may fear[^h3372] thee all the days[^h3117] that they live[^h2416] in[^h6440] the land[^h127] which thou gavest[^h5414] unto our fathers[^h1].
###### 41
Moreover concerning a stranger[^h5237], that is not of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], but cometh out[^h935] of a far[^h7350] country[^h776] for[^h4616] thy name's[^h8034] sake;
###### 42
(For they shall hear[^h8085] of thy great[^h1419] name[^h8034], and of thy strong[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and of thy stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220];) when he shall come[^h935] and pray[^h6419] toward this house[^h1004];
###### 43
Hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064] thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], and do[^h6213] according to all that the stranger[^h5237] calleth[^h7121] to thee for: that all people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776] may know[^h3045] thy name[^h8034], to fear[^h3372] thee, as do thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]; and that they may know[^h3045] that this house[^h1004], which I have builded[^h1129], is called[^h7121] by thy name[^h8034]. 
###### 44
If thy people[^h5971] go out[^h3318] to battle[^h4421] against their enemy[^h341], whithersoever[^h1870] thou shalt send[^h7971] them, and shall pray[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068] toward[^h1870] the city[^h5892] which thou hast chosen[^h977], and toward the house[^h1004] that I have built[^h1129] for thy name[^h8034]: 
###### 45
Then hear[^h8085] thou in heaven[^h8064] their prayer[^h8605] and their supplication[^h8467], and maintain[^h6213] their cause[^h4941]. 
###### 46
If they sin[^h2398] against thee, (for there is no man[^h120] that sinneth[^h2398] not,) and thou be angry[^h599] with them, and deliver[^h5414] them to the enemy[^h341], so that they carry them away[^h7617] captives[^h7617] unto[^h6440] the land[^h776] of the enemy[^h341], far[^h7350] or near[^h7138];
###### 47
Yet if they shall bethink[^h7725] themselves in the land[^h776] whither they were carried captives[^h7617], and repent[^h7725] [^h3820], and make supplication[^h2603] unto thee in the land[^h776] of them that carried them captives[^h7617], saying[^h559], We have sinned[^h2398], and have done perversely[^h5753], we have committed wickedness[^h7561]; 
###### 48
And so return[^h7725] unto thee with all their heart[^h3824], and with all their soul[^h5315], in the land[^h776] of their enemies[^h341], which led them away captive[^h7617], and pray[^h6419] unto thee toward[^h1870] their land[^h776], which thou gavest[^h5414] unto their fathers[^h1], the city[^h5892] which thou hast chosen[^h977], and the house[^h1004] which I have built[^h1129] for thy name[^h8034]:
###### 49
Then hear[^h8085] thou their prayer[^h8605] and their supplication[^h8467] in heaven[^h8064] thy dwelling[^h3427] place[^h4349], and maintain[^h6213] their cause[^h4941], 
###### 50
And forgive[^h5545] thy people[^h5971] that have sinned[^h2398] against thee, and all their transgressions[^h6588] wherein they have transgressed[^h6586] against thee, and give[^h5414] them compassion[^h7356] before[^h6440] them who carried them captive[^h7617], that they may have compassion[^h7355] on them:
###### 51
For they be thy people[^h5971], and thine inheritance[^h5159], which thou broughtest forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714], from the midst[^h8432] of the furnace[^h3564] of iron[^h1270]:
###### 52
That thine eyes[^h5869] may be open[^h6605] unto the supplication[^h8467] of thy servant[^h5650], and unto the supplication[^h8467] of thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], to hearken[^h8085] unto them in all that they call[^h7121] for unto thee.
###### 53
For thou didst separate[^h914] them from among all the people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776], to be thine inheritance[^h5159], as thou spakest[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872] thy servant[^h5650], when thou broughtest[^h3318] our fathers[^h1] out of Egypt[^h4714], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 54
And it was so, that when Solomon[^h8010] had made an end[^h3615] of praying[^h6419] all this prayer[^h8605] and supplication[^h8467] unto the LORD[^h3068], he arose[^h6965] from before[^h6440] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], from kneeling[^h3766] on his knees[^h1290] with his hands[^h3709] spread up[^h6566] to heaven[^h8064].
###### 55
And he stood[^h5975], and blessed[^h1288] all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], saying[^h559],
###### 56
Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068], that hath given[^h5414] rest[^h4496] unto his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], according to all that he promised[^h1696]: there hath not failed[^h5307] one[^h259] word[^h1697] of all his good[^h2896] promise[^h1697], which he promised[^h1696] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872] his servant[^h5650]. 
###### 57
The LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] be with us, as he was with our fathers[^h1]: let him not leave[^h5800] us, nor forsake[^h5203] us:
###### 58
That he may incline[^h5186] our hearts[^h3824] unto him, to walk[^h3212] in all his ways[^h1870], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687], and his statutes[^h2706], and his judgments[^h4941], which he commanded[^h6680] our fathers[^h1].
###### 59
And let these my words[^h1697], wherewith I have made supplication[^h2603] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], be nigh[^h7138] unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915], that he maintain[^h6213] the cause[^h4941] of his servant[^h5650], and the cause[^h4941] of his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] at all times[^h3117] [^h3117], as the matter[^h1697] shall require: 
###### 60
That all the people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776] may know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] is God[^h430], and that there is none else.
###### 61
Let your heart[^h3824] therefore be perfect[^h8003] with the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in his statutes[^h2706], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687], as at this day[^h3117].
###### 62
And the king[^h4428], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, offered[^h2076] sacrifice[^h2077] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 63
And Solomon[^h8010] offered[^h2076] a sacrifice[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002], which he offered[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068], two[^h8147] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] oxen[^h1241], and an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629]. So the king[^h4428] and all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] dedicated[^h2596] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 64
The same day[^h3117] did the king[^h4428] hallow[^h6942] the middle[^h8432] of the court[^h2691] that was before[^h6440] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: for there he offered[^h6213] burnt offerings[^h5930], and meat offerings[^h4503], and the fat[^h2459] of the peace offerings[^h8002]: because the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196] that was before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] was too little[^h6996] to receive[^h3557] the burnt offerings[^h5930], and meat offerings[^h4503], and the fat[^h2459] of the peace offerings[^h8002].
###### 65

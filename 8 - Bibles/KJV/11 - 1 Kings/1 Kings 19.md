###### 1
And Ahab[^h256] told[^h5046] Jezebel[^h348] all that Elijah[^h452] had done[^h6213], and withal how he had slain[^h2026] all the prophets[^h5030] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 2
Then Jezebel[^h348] sent[^h7971] a messenger[^h4397] unto Elijah[^h452], saying[^h559], So let the gods[^h430] do[^h6213] to me, and more[^h3254] also, if I make[^h7760] not thy life[^h5315] as the life[^h5315] of one[^h259] of them by to morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256].
###### 3
And when he saw[^h7200] that, he arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] for his life[^h5315], and came[^h935] to Beersheba[^h884], which belongeth to Judah[^h3063], and left[^h3240] his servant[^h5288] there.
###### 4
But he himself went[^h1980] a day's[^h3117] journey[^h1870] into the wilderness[^h4057], and came[^h935] and sat down[^h3427] under a[^h259] juniper tree[^h7574]: and he requested[^h7592] for himself[^h5315] that he might die[^h4191]; and said[^h559], It is enough[^h7227]; now, O LORD[^h3068], take away[^h3947] my life[^h5315]; for I am not better[^h2896] than my fathers[^h1]. 
###### 5
And as he lay[^h7901] and slept[^h3462] under a[^h259] juniper tree[^h7574], behold, then an angel[^h4397] touched[^h5060] him, and said[^h559] unto him, Arise[^h6965] and eat[^h398].
###### 6
And he looked[^h5027], and, behold, there was a cake[^h5692] baken on the coals[^h7529], and a cruse[^h6835] of water[^h4325] at his head[^h4763]. And he did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and laid him down[^h7901] again[^h7725]. 
###### 7
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] came again[^h7725] the second time[^h8145], and touched[^h5060] him, and said[^h559], Arise[^h6965] and eat[^h398]; because the journey[^h1870] is too great[^h7227] for thee.
###### 8
And he arose[^h6965], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and went[^h3212] in the strength[^h3581] of that meat[^h396] forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915] unto Horeb[^h2722] the mount[^h2022] of God[^h430].
###### 9
And he came[^h935] thither unto a cave[^h4631], and lodged[^h3885] there; and, behold, the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to him, and he said[^h559] unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah[^h452]?
###### 10
And he said[^h559], I have been very[^h7065] jealous[^h7065] for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635]: for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] have forsaken[^h5800] thy covenant[^h1285], thrown down[^h2040] thine altars[^h4196], and slain[^h2026] thy prophets[^h5030] with the sword[^h2719]; and I, even I only, am left[^h3498]; and they seek[^h1245] my life[^h5315], to take it away[^h3947].
###### 11
And he said[^h559], Go forth[^h3318], and stand[^h5975] upon the mount[^h2022] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. And, behold, the LORD[^h3068] passed by[^h5674], and a great[^h1419] and strong[^h2389] wind[^h7307] rent[^h6561] the mountains[^h2022], and brake in pieces[^h7665] the rocks[^h5553] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; but the LORD[^h3068] was not in the wind[^h7307]: and after[^h310] the wind[^h7307] an earthquake[^h7494]; but the LORD[^h3068] was not in the earthquake[^h7494]:
###### 12
And after[^h310] the earthquake[^h7494] a fire[^h784]; but the LORD[^h3068] was not in the fire[^h784]: and after[^h310] the fire[^h784] a still[^h1827] small[^h1851] voice[^h6963].
###### 13
And it was so, when Elijah[^h452] heard[^h8085] it, that he wrapped[^h3874] his face[^h6440] in his mantle[^h155], and went out[^h3318], and stood[^h5975] in the entering in[^h6607] of the cave[^h4631]. And, behold, there came a voice[^h6963] unto him, and said[^h559], What doest thou here, Elijah[^h452]?
###### 14
And he said[^h559], I have been very[^h7065] jealous[^h7065] for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635]: because the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] have forsaken[^h5800] thy covenant[^h1285], thrown down[^h2040] thine altars[^h4196], and slain[^h2026] thy prophets[^h5030] with the sword[^h2719]; and I, even I only, am left[^h3498]; and they seek[^h1245] my life[^h5315], to take it away[^h3947].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212], return[^h7725] on thy way[^h1870] to the wilderness[^h4057] of Damascus[^h1834]: and when thou comest[^h935], anoint[^h4886] Hazael[^h2371] to be king[^h4428] over Syria[^h758]:
###### 16
And Jehu[^h3058] the son[^h1121] of Nimshi[^h5250] shalt thou anoint[^h4886] to be king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478]: and Elisha[^h477] the son[^h1121] of Shaphat[^h8202] of Abelmeholah[^h65] shalt thou anoint[^h4886] to be prophet[^h5030] in thy room. 
###### 17
And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth[^h4422] the sword[^h2719] of Hazael[^h2371] shall Jehu[^h3058] slay[^h4191]: and him that escapeth[^h4422] from the sword[^h2719] of Jehu[^h3058] shall Elisha[^h477] slay[^h4191].
###### 18
Yet I have left[^h7604] me seven[^h7651] thousand[^h505] in Israel[^h3478], all the knees[^h1290] which have not bowed[^h3766] unto Baal[^h1168], and every mouth[^h6310] which hath not kissed[^h5401] him. 
###### 19
So he departed[^h3212] thence, and found[^h4672] Elisha[^h477] the son[^h1121] of Shaphat[^h8202], who was plowing[^h2790] with twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] yoke[^h6776] of oxen before[^h6440] him, and he with the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240]: and Elijah[^h452] passed[^h5674] by him, and cast[^h7993] his mantle[^h155] upon him.
###### 20
And he left[^h5800] the oxen[^h1241], and ran[^h7323] after[^h310] Elijah[^h452], and said[^h559], Let me, I pray thee, kiss[^h5401] my father[^h1] and my mother[^h517], and then I will follow[^h3212] [^h310] thee. And he said[^h559] unto him, Go back[^h3212] again[^h7725]: for what have I done[^h6213] to thee? 
###### 21
And he returned back[^h7725] from him[^h310], and took[^h3947] a yoke[^h6776] of oxen[^h1241], and slew[^h2076] them, and boiled[^h1310] their flesh[^h1320] with the instruments[^h3627] of the oxen[^h1241], and gave[^h5414] unto the people[^h5971], and they did eat[^h398]. Then he arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] after[^h310] Elijah[^h452], and ministered[^h8334] unto him.

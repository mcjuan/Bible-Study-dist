###### 1
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158] had a vineyard[^h3754], which was in Jezreel[^h3157], hard by[^h681] the palace[^h1964] of Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Samaria[^h8111].
###### 2
And Ahab[^h256] spake[^h1696] unto Naboth[^h5022], saying[^h559], Give[^h5414] me thy vineyard[^h3754], that I may have it for a garden[^h1588] of herbs[^h3419], because it is near[^h7138] unto[^h681] my house[^h1004]: and I will give[^h5414] thee for it a better[^h2896] vineyard[^h3754] than it; or, if it seem good[^h2896] to thee[^h5869], I will give[^h5414] thee the worth[^h4242] of it in money[^h3701]. 
###### 3
And Naboth[^h5022] said[^h559] to Ahab[^h256], The LORD[^h3068] forbid[^h2486] it me, that I should give[^h5414] the inheritance[^h5159] of my fathers[^h1] unto thee.
###### 4
And Ahab[^h256] came[^h935] into his house[^h1004] heavy[^h5620] and displeased[^h2198] because of the word[^h1697] which Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158] had spoken[^h1696] to him: for he had said[^h559], I will not give[^h5414] thee the inheritance[^h5159] of my fathers[^h1]. And he laid him down[^h7901] upon his bed[^h4296], and turned away[^h5437] his face[^h6440], and would eat[^h398] no bread[^h3899].
###### 5
But Jezebel[^h348] his wife[^h802] came[^h935] to him, and said[^h1696] unto him, Why is thy spirit[^h7307] so sad[^h5620], that thou eatest[^h398] no bread[^h3899]?
###### 6
And he said[^h1696] unto her, Because I spake[^h1696] unto Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158], and said[^h559] unto him, Give[^h5414] me thy vineyard[^h3754] for money[^h3701]; or else, if it please[^h2655] thee, I will give[^h5414] thee another vineyard[^h3754] for it: and he answered[^h559], I will not give[^h5414] thee my vineyard[^h3754].
###### 7
And Jezebel[^h348] his wife[^h802] said[^h559] unto him, Dost thou now govern[^h6213] the kingdom[^h4410] of Israel[^h3478]? arise[^h6965], and eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], and let thine heart[^h3820] be merry[^h3190]: I will give[^h5414] thee the vineyard[^h3754] of Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158].
###### 8
So she wrote[^h3789] letters[^h5612] in Ahab's[^h256] name[^h8034], and sealed[^h2856] them with his seal[^h2368], and sent[^h7971] the letters[^h5612] unto the elders[^h2205] and to the nobles[^h2715] that were in his city[^h5892], dwelling[^h3427] with Naboth[^h5022].
###### 9
And she wrote[^h3789] in the letters[^h5612], saying[^h559], Proclaim[^h7121] a fast[^h6685], and set[^h3427] Naboth[^h5022] on high[^h7218] among the people[^h5971]: 
###### 10
And set[^h3427] two[^h8147] men[^h582], sons[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], before him, to bear witness[^h5749] against him, saying[^h559], Thou didst blaspheme[^h1288] God[^h430] and the king[^h4428]. And then carry him out[^h3318], and stone[^h5619] him, that he may die[^h4191].
###### 11
And the men[^h582] of his city[^h5892], even the elders[^h2205] and the nobles[^h2715] who were the inhabitants[^h3427] in his city[^h5892], did[^h6213] as Jezebel[^h348] had sent[^h7971] unto them, and as it was written[^h3789] in the letters[^h5612] which she had sent[^h7971] unto them.
###### 12
They proclaimed[^h7121] a fast[^h6685], and set[^h3427] Naboth[^h5022] on high[^h7218] among the people[^h5971].
###### 13
And there came[^h935] in two[^h8147] men[^h582], children[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], and sat[^h3427] before him: and the men[^h582] of Belial[^h1100] witnessed[^h5749] against him, even against Naboth[^h5022], in the presence of the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Naboth[^h5022] did blaspheme[^h1288] God[^h430] and the king[^h4428]. Then they carried him forth[^h3318] out[^h2351] of the city[^h5892], and stoned[^h5619] him with stones[^h68], that he died[^h4191].
###### 14
Then they sent[^h7971] to Jezebel[^h348], saying[^h559], Naboth[^h5022] is stoned[^h5619], and is dead[^h4191].
###### 15
And it came to pass, when Jezebel[^h348] heard[^h8085] that Naboth[^h5022] was stoned[^h5619], and was dead[^h4191], that Jezebel[^h348] said[^h559] to Ahab[^h256], Arise[^h6965], take possession[^h3423] of the vineyard[^h3754] of Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158], which he refused[^h3985] to give[^h5414] thee for money[^h3701]: for Naboth[^h5022] is not alive[^h2416], but dead[^h4191].
###### 16
And it came to pass, when Ahab[^h256] heard[^h8085] that Naboth[^h5022] was dead[^h4191], that Ahab[^h256] rose up[^h6965] to go down[^h3381] to the vineyard[^h3754] of Naboth[^h5022] the Jezreelite[^h3158], to take possession[^h3423] of it.
###### 17
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664], saying[^h559],
###### 18
Arise[^h6965], go down[^h3381] to meet[^h7125] Ahab[^h256] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], which is in Samaria[^h8111]: behold, he is in the vineyard[^h3754] of Naboth[^h5022], whither he is gone down[^h3381] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 19
And thou shalt speak[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Hast thou killed[^h7523], and also taken possession[^h3423]? And thou shalt speak[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], In the place[^h4725] where dogs[^h3611] licked[^h3952] the blood[^h1818] of Naboth[^h5022] shall dogs[^h3611] lick[^h3952] thy blood[^h1818], even thine.
###### 20
And Ahab[^h256] said[^h559] to Elijah[^h452], Hast thou found[^h4672] me, O mine enemy[^h341]? And he answered[^h559], I have found[^h4672] thee: because thou hast sold[^h4376] thyself to work[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
Behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon thee, and will take away[^h1197] thy posterity[^h310], and will cut off[^h3772] from Ahab[^h256] him that pisseth[^h8366] against the wall[^h7023], and him that is shut up[^h6113] and left[^h5800] in Israel[^h3478],
###### 22
And will make[^h5414] thine house[^h1004] like the house[^h1004] of Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], and like the house[^h1004] of Baasha[^h1201] the son[^h1121] of Ahijah[^h281], for the provocation[^h3708] wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger[^h3707], and made Israel[^h3478] to sin[^h2398].
###### 23
And of Jezebel[^h348] also spake[^h1696] the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], The dogs[^h3611] shall eat[^h398] Jezebel[^h348] by the wall[^h2426] of Jezreel[^h3157]. 
###### 24
Him that dieth[^h4191] of Ahab[^h256] in the city[^h5892] the dogs[^h3611] shall eat[^h398]; and him that dieth[^h4191] in the field[^h7704] shall the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064] eat[^h398].
###### 25
But there was none like unto Ahab[^h256], which did sell[^h4376] himself to work[^h6213] wickedness[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], whom Jezebel[^h348] his wife[^h802] stirred up[^h5496]. 
###### 26
And he did very[^h3966] abominably[^h8581] in following[^h3212] [^h310] idols[^h1544], according to all things as did[^h6213] the Amorites[^h567], whom the LORD[^h3068] cast out[^h3423] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 27
And it came to pass, when Ahab[^h256] heard[^h8085] those words[^h1697], that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], and put[^h7760] sackcloth[^h8242] upon his flesh[^h1320], and fasted[^h6684], and lay[^h7901] in sackcloth[^h8242], and went[^h1980] softly[^h328].
###### 28
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Elijah[^h452] the Tishbite[^h8664], saying[^h559],
###### 29
Seest[^h7200] thou how Ahab[^h256] humbleth[^h3665] himself before[^h6440] me? because[^h3282] he humbleth[^h3665] himself before[^h6440] me, I will not bring[^h935] the evil[^h7451] in his days[^h3117]: but in his son's[^h1121] days[^h3117] will I bring[^h935] the evil[^h7451] upon his house[^h1004].

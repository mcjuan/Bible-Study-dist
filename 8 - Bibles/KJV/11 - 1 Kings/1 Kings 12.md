###### 1
And Rehoboam[^h7346] went[^h3212] to Shechem[^h7927]: for all Israel[^h3478] were come[^h935] to Shechem[^h7927] to make him king[^h4427].
###### 2
And it came to pass, when Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028], who was yet in Egypt[^h4714], heard[^h8085] of it, (for he was fled[^h1272] from the presence[^h6440] of king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010], and Jeroboam[^h3379] dwelt[^h3427] in Egypt[^h4714];)
###### 3
That they sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] him. And Jeroboam[^h3379] and all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935], and spake[^h1696] unto Rehoboam[^h7346], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Thy father[^h1] made[^h7185] our yoke[^h5923] grievous[^h7185]: now therefore make thou the grievous[^h7186] service[^h5656] of thy father[^h1], and his heavy[^h3515] yoke[^h5923] which he put[^h5414] upon us, lighter[^h7043], and we will serve[^h5647] thee.
###### 5
And he said[^h559] unto them, Depart[^h3212] yet for three[^h7969] days[^h3117], then come again[^h7725] to me. And the people[^h5971] departed[^h3212].
###### 6
And king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] consulted[^h3289] with the old men[^h2205], that stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Solomon[^h8010] his father[^h1] while he yet lived[^h2416], and said[^h559], How do ye advise[^h3289] that I may[^h7725] answer[^h1697] this people[^h5971]?
###### 7
And they spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], If thou wilt be a servant[^h5650] unto this people[^h5971] this day[^h3117], and wilt serve[^h5647] them, and answer[^h6030] them, and speak[^h1696] good[^h2896] words[^h1697] to them, then they will be thy servants[^h5650] for ever[^h3117].
###### 8
But he forsook[^h5800] the counsel[^h6098] of the old men[^h2205], which they had given[^h3289] him, and consulted[^h3289] with the young men[^h3206] that were grown up[^h1431] with him, and which stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him:
###### 9
And he said[^h559] unto them, What counsel give[^h3289] ye that we may[^h7725] answer[^h1697] this people[^h5971], who have spoken[^h1696] to me, saying[^h559], Make[^h7043] the yoke[^h5923] which thy father[^h1] did put[^h5414] upon us lighter[^h7043]?
###### 10
And the young men[^h3206] that were grown up[^h1431] with him spake[^h1696] unto him, saying[^h559], Thus shalt thou speak[^h559] unto this people[^h5971] that spake[^h1696] unto thee, saying[^h559], Thy father[^h1] made[^h3513] our yoke[^h5923] heavy[^h3513], but make thou it lighter[^h7043] unto us; thus shalt thou say[^h1696] unto them, My little[^h6995] finger shall be thicker[^h5666] than my father's[^h1] loins[^h4975].
###### 11
And now whereas my father[^h1] did lade[^h6006] you with a heavy[^h3515] yoke[^h5923], I will add[^h3254] to your yoke[^h5923]: my father[^h1] hath chastised[^h3256] you with whips[^h7752], but I will chastise[^h3256] you with scorpions[^h6137].
###### 12
So Jeroboam[^h3379] and all the people[^h5971] came[^h935] to Rehoboam[^h7346] the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], as the king[^h4428] had appointed[^h1696], saying[^h559], Come to me again[^h7725] the third[^h7992] day[^h3117].
###### 13
And the king[^h4428] answered[^h6030] the people[^h5971] roughly[^h7186], and forsook[^h5800] the old men's[^h2205] counsel[^h6098] that they gave[^h3289] him; 
###### 14
And spake[^h1696] to them after the counsel[^h6098] of the young men[^h3206], saying[^h559], My father[^h1] made[^h3513] your yoke[^h5923] heavy[^h3513], and I will add[^h3254] to your yoke[^h5923]: my father[^h1] also chastised[^h3256] you with whips[^h7752], but I will chastise[^h3256] you with scorpions[^h6137].
###### 15
Wherefore the king[^h4428] hearkened[^h8085] not unto the people[^h5971]; for the cause[^h5438] was from the LORD[^h3068], that he might perform[^h6965] his saying[^h1697], which the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] Ahijah[^h281] the Shilonite[^h7888] unto Jeroboam[^h3379] the son[^h1121] of Nebat[^h5028].
###### 16
So[^h7725] when all Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that the king[^h4428] hearkened[^h8085] not unto them, the people[^h5971] answered[^h1697] the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], What portion[^h2506] have we in David[^h1732]? neither have we inheritance[^h5159] in the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448]: to your tents[^h168], O Israel[^h3478]: now see[^h7200] to thine own house[^h1004], David[^h1732]. So Israel[^h3478] departed[^h3212] unto their tents[^h168].
###### 17
But as for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] which dwelt[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], Rehoboam[^h7346] reigned[^h4427] over them.
###### 18
Then king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] sent[^h7971] Adoram[^h151], who was over the tribute[^h4522]; and all Israel[^h3478] stoned[^h7275] him with stones[^h68], that he died[^h4191]. Therefore king[^h4428] Rehoboam[^h7346] made speed[^h553] to get him up[^h5927] to his chariot[^h4818], to flee[^h5127] to Jerusalem[^h3389]. 
###### 19
So Israel[^h3478] rebelled[^h6586] against the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 20
And it came to pass, when all Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] that Jeroboam[^h3379] was come again[^h7725], that they sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] him unto the congregation[^h5712], and made him king[^h4427] over all Israel[^h3478]: there was none that followed[^h310] the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], but[^h2108] the tribe[^h7626] of Judah[^h3063] only.
###### 21
And when Rehoboam[^h7346] was come[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], he assembled[^h6950] all the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], with the tribe[^h7626] of Benjamin[^h1144], an hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] thousand[^h505] chosen men[^h977], which were warriors[^h6213] [^h4421], to fight[^h3898] against the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], to bring[^h7725] the kingdom[^h4410] again[^h7725] to Rehoboam[^h7346] the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010].
###### 22
But the word[^h1697] of God[^h430] came unto Shemaiah[^h8098] the man[^h376] of God[^h430], saying[^h559],
###### 23
Speak[^h559] unto Rehoboam[^h7346], the son[^h1121] of Solomon[^h8010], king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and unto all the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] and Benjamin[^h1144], and to the remnant[^h3499] of the people[^h5971], saying[^h559],
###### 24
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Ye shall not go up[^h5927], nor fight[^h3898] against your brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: return[^h7725] every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004]; for this thing[^h1697] is[^h1961] from me. They hearkened[^h8085] therefore to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and returned[^h7725] to depart[^h3212], according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
Then Jeroboam[^h3379] built[^h1129] Shechem[^h7927] in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and dwelt[^h3427] therein; and went out[^h3318] from thence, and built[^h1129] Penuel[^h6439].
###### 26
And Jeroboam[^h3379] said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], Now shall the kingdom[^h4467] return[^h7725] to the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732]:
###### 27
If this people[^h5971] go up[^h5927] to do[^h6213] sacrifice[^h2077] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] at Jerusalem[^h3389], then shall the heart[^h3820] of this people[^h5971] turn again[^h7725] unto their lord[^h113], even unto Rehoboam[^h7346] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and they shall kill[^h2026] me, and go again[^h7725] to Rehoboam[^h7346] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 28
Whereupon the king[^h4428] took counsel[^h3289], and made[^h6213] two[^h8147] calves[^h5695] of gold[^h2091], and said[^h559] unto them, It is too much[^h7227] for you to go up[^h5927] to Jerusalem[^h3389]: behold thy gods[^h430], O Israel[^h3478], which brought thee up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 29
And he set[^h7760] the one[^h259] in Bethel[^h1008], and the other[^h259] put[^h5414] he in Dan[^h1835].
###### 30
And this thing[^h1697] became a sin[^h2403]: for the people[^h5971] went[^h3212] to worship before[^h6440] the one[^h259], even unto Dan[^h1835].
###### 31
And he made[^h6213] an house[^h1004] of high places[^h1116], and made[^h6213] priests[^h3548] of the lowest[^h7098] of the people[^h5971], which were not of the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878].
###### 32
And Jeroboam[^h3379] ordained[^h6213] a feast[^h2282] in the eighth[^h8066] month[^h2320], on the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320], like unto the feast[^h2282] that is in Judah[^h3063], and he offered[^h5927] upon the altar[^h4196]. So did[^h6213] he in Bethel[^h1008], sacrificing[^h2076] unto the calves[^h5695] that he had made[^h6213]: and he placed[^h5975] in Bethel[^h1008] the priests[^h3548] of the high places[^h1116] which he had made[^h6213].  
###### 33
So he offered[^h5927] upon the altar[^h4196] which he had made[^h6213] in Bethel[^h1008] the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the eighth[^h8066] month[^h2320], even in the month[^h2320] which he had devised[^h908] of his own heart[^h3820]; and ordained[^h6213] a feast[^h2282] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and he offered[^h5927] upon the altar[^h4196], and burnt incense[^h6999].

###### 1
Now king[^h4428] David[^h1732] was old[^h2204] and stricken[^h935] in years[^h3117]; and they covered[^h3680] him with clothes[^h899], but he gat no heat[^h3179]. 
###### 2
Wherefore his servants[^h5650] said[^h559] unto him, Let there be sought[^h1245] for my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] a young[^h5291] virgin[^h1330]: and let her stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], and let her cherish[^h5532] him, and let her lie[^h7901] in thy bosom[^h2436], that my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] may get heat[^h2552].   
###### 3
So they sought[^h1245] for a fair[^h3303] damsel[^h5291] throughout all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478], and found[^h4672] Abishag[^h49] a Shunammite[^h7767], and brought[^h935] her to the king[^h4428].
###### 4
And the damsel[^h5291] was very[^h3966] fair[^h3303], and cherished[^h5532] the king[^h4428], and ministered[^h8334] to him: but the king[^h4428] knew[^h3045] her not.
###### 5
Then Adonijah[^h138] the son[^h1121] of Haggith[^h2294] exalted[^h4984] himself, saying[^h559], I will be king[^h4427]: and he prepared[^h6213] him chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571], and fifty[^h2572] men[^h376] to run[^h7323] before[^h6440] him. 
###### 6
And his father[^h1] had not displeased[^h6087] him at any time[^h3117] in saying[^h559], Why hast thou done so[^h6213]? and he also was a very[^h3966] goodly[^h2896] [^h8389] man; and his mother bare[^h3205] him after[^h310] Absalom[^h53]. 
###### 7
And he conferred[^h1697] with Joab[^h3097] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], and with Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548]: and they following[^h310] Adonijah[^h138] helped[^h5826] him.  
###### 8
But Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and Shimei[^h8096], and Rei[^h7472], and the mighty men[^h1368] which belonged to David[^h1732], were not with Adonijah[^h138].
###### 9
And Adonijah[^h138] slew[^h2076] sheep[^h6629] and oxen[^h1241] and fat cattle[^h4806] by the stone[^h68] of Zoheleth[^h2120], which is by[^h681] Enrogel[^h5883], and called[^h7121] all his brethren[^h251] the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121], and all the men[^h582] of Judah[^h3063] the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650]: 
###### 10
But Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and Benaiah[^h1141], and the mighty men[^h1368], and Solomon[^h8010] his brother[^h251], he called[^h7121] not.
###### 11
Wherefore Nathan[^h5416] spake[^h559] unto Bathsheba[^h1339] the mother[^h517] of Solomon[^h8010], saying[^h559], Hast thou not heard[^h8085] that Adonijah[^h138] the son[^h1121] of Haggith[^h2294] doth reign[^h4427], and David[^h1732] our lord[^h113] knoweth[^h3045] it not?
###### 12
Now therefore come[^h3212], let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel[^h3289] [^h6098], that thou mayest save[^h4422] thine own life[^h5315], and the life[^h5315] of thy son[^h1121] Solomon[^h8010].
###### 13
Go[^h3212] and get thee in[^h935] unto king[^h4428] David[^h1732], and say[^h559] unto him, Didst not thou, my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], swear[^h7650] unto thine handmaid[^h519], saying[^h559], Assuredly[^h3588] Solomon[^h8010] thy son[^h1121] shall reign[^h4427] after[^h310] me, and he shall sit[^h3427] upon my throne[^h3678]? why then doth Adonijah[^h138] reign[^h4427]?
###### 14
Behold, while thou yet talkest[^h1696] there with the king[^h4428], I also will come in[^h935] after[^h310] thee, and confirm[^h4390] thy words[^h1697]. 
###### 15
And Bathsheba[^h1339] went in[^h935] unto the king[^h4428] into the chamber[^h2315]: and the king[^h4428] was very[^h3966] old[^h2204]; and Abishag[^h49] the Shunammite[^h7767] ministered[^h8334] unto the king[^h4428].
###### 16
And Bathsheba[^h1339] bowed[^h6915], and did obeisance[^h7812] unto the king[^h4428]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], What wouldest thou? 
###### 17
And she said[^h559] unto him, My lord[^h113], thou swarest[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] unto thine handmaid[^h519], saying, Assuredly Solomon[^h8010] thy son[^h1121] shall reign[^h4427] after[^h310] me, and he shall sit[^h3427] upon my throne[^h3678].
###### 18
And now, behold, Adonijah[^h138] reigneth[^h4427]; and now, my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], thou knowest[^h3045] it not:
###### 19
And he hath slain[^h2076] oxen[^h7794] and fat cattle[^h4806] and sheep[^h6629] in abundance[^h7230], and hath called[^h7121] all the sons[^h1121] of the king[^h4428], and Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548], and Joab[^h3097] the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635]: but Solomon[^h8010] thy servant[^h5650] hath he not called[^h7121].
###### 20
And thou, my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], the eyes[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478] are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell[^h5046] them who shall sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] after[^h310] him.
###### 21
Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] shall sleep[^h7901] with his fathers[^h1], that I and my son[^h1121] Solomon[^h8010] shall be counted offenders[^h2400]. 
###### 22
And, lo, while she yet talked[^h1696] with the king[^h4428], Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030] also came in[^h935].
###### 23
And they told[^h5046] the king[^h4428], saying[^h559], Behold Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030]. And when he was come in[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], he bowed[^h7812] himself before the king[^h4428] with his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776].
###### 24
And Nathan[^h5416] said[^h559], My lord[^h113], O king[^h4428], hast thou said[^h559], Adonijah[^h138] shall reign[^h4427] after[^h310] me, and he shall sit[^h3427] upon my throne[^h3678]?
###### 25
For he is gone down[^h3381] this day[^h3117], and hath slain[^h2076] oxen[^h7794] and fat cattle[^h4806] and sheep[^h6629] in abundance[^h7230], and hath called[^h7121] all the king's[^h4428] sons[^h1121], and the captains[^h8269] of the host[^h6635], and Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548]; and, behold, they eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354] before[^h6440] him, and say[^h559], God save[^h2421] king[^h4428] Adonijah[^h138]. 
###### 26
But me, even me thy servant[^h5650], and Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], and thy servant[^h5650] Solomon[^h8010], hath he not called[^h7121].
###### 27
Is this thing[^h1697] done[^h1961] by my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], and thou hast not shewed[^h3045] it unto thy servant[^h5650], who should sit[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] after[^h310] him?
###### 28
Then king[^h4428] David[^h1732] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Call[^h7121] me Bathsheba[^h1339]. And she came[^h935] into the king's[^h4428] presence[^h6440], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 29
And the king[^h4428] sware[^h7650], and said[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], that hath redeemed[^h6299] my soul[^h5315] out of all distress[^h6869],
###### 30
Even as I sware[^h7650] unto thee by the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Assuredly Solomon[^h8010] thy son[^h1121] shall reign[^h4427] after[^h310] me, and he shall sit[^h3427] upon my throne[^h3678] in my stead; even so will I certainly do[^h6213] this day[^h3117].
###### 31
Then Bathsheba[^h1339] bowed[^h6915] with her face[^h639] to the earth[^h776], and did reverence[^h7812] to the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], Let my lord[^h113] king[^h4428] David[^h1732] live[^h2421] for ever[^h5769].
###### 32
And king[^h4428] David[^h1732] said[^h559], Call[^h7121] me Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077]. And they came[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 33
The king[^h4428] also said[^h559] unto them, Take[^h3947] with you the servants[^h5650] of your lord[^h113], and cause Solomon[^h8010] my son[^h1121] to ride[^h7392] upon mine own mule[^h6506], and bring him down[^h3381] to Gihon[^h1521]: 
###### 34
And let Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548] and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030] anoint[^h4886] him there king[^h4428] over Israel[^h3478]: and blow[^h8628] ye with the trumpet[^h7782], and say[^h559], God save[^h2421] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].
###### 35
Then ye shall come up[^h5927] after[^h310] him, that he may come[^h935] and sit[^h3427] upon my throne[^h3678]; for he shall be king[^h4427] in my stead: and I have appointed[^h6680] him to be ruler[^h5057] over Israel[^h3478] and over Judah[^h3063].
###### 36
And Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077] answered[^h6030] the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], Amen[^h543]: the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] say[^h559] so too.
###### 37
As the LORD[^h3068] hath been with my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], even so be he with Solomon[^h8010], and make[^h1431] his throne[^h3678] greater[^h1431] than the throne[^h3678] of my lord[^h113] king[^h4428] David[^h1732].
###### 38
So Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], and the Cherethites[^h3774], and the Pelethites[^h6432], went down[^h3381], and caused Solomon[^h8010] to ride[^h7392] upon king[^h4428] David's[^h1732] mule[^h6506], and brought[^h3212] him to Gihon[^h1521].
###### 39
And Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548] took[^h3947] an horn[^h7161] of oil[^h8081] out of the tabernacle[^h168], and anointed[^h4886] Solomon[^h8010]. And they blew[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782]; and all the people[^h5971] said[^h559], God save[^h2421] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010].
###### 40
And all the people[^h5971] came up[^h5927] after[^h310] him, and the people[^h5971] piped[^h2490] with pipes[^h2485], and rejoiced[^h8056] with great[^h1419] joy[^h8057], so that the earth[^h776] rent[^h1234] with the sound[^h6963] of them. 
###### 41
And Adonijah[^h138] and all the guests[^h7121] that were with him heard[^h8085] it as they had made an end[^h3615] of eating[^h398]. And when Joab[^h3097] heard[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], he said[^h559], Wherefore is this noise[^h6963] of the city[^h7151] being in an uproar[^h1993]?
###### 42
And while he yet spake[^h1696], behold, Jonathan[^h3129] the son[^h1121] of Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548] came[^h935]: and Adonijah[^h138] said[^h559] unto him, Come in[^h935]; for thou art a valiant[^h2428] man[^h376] [^h381], and bringest[^h1319] good[^h2896] tidings[^h1319].
###### 43
And Jonathan[^h3129] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] to Adonijah[^h138], Verily[^h61] our lord[^h113] king[^h4428] David[^h1732] hath made Solomon[^h8010] king[^h4427].
###### 44
And the king[^h4428] hath sent[^h7971] with him Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548], and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030], and Benaiah[^h1141] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiada[^h3077], and the Cherethites[^h3774], and the Pelethites[^h6432], and they have caused him to ride[^h7392] upon the king's[^h4428] mule[^h6506]:
###### 45
And Zadok[^h6659] the priest[^h3548] and Nathan[^h5416] the prophet[^h5030] have anointed[^h4886] him king[^h4428] in Gihon[^h1521]: and they are come up[^h5927] from thence rejoicing[^h8056], so that the city[^h7151] rang again[^h1949]. This is the noise[^h6963] that ye have heard[^h8085].
###### 46
And also Solomon[^h8010] sitteth[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of the kingdom[^h4410].
###### 47
And moreover the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650] came[^h935] to bless[^h1288] our lord[^h113] king[^h4428] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], God[^h430] make the name[^h8034] of Solomon[^h8010] better[^h3190] than thy name[^h8034], and make[^h1431] his throne[^h3678] greater[^h1431] than thy throne[^h3678]. And the king[^h4428] bowed[^h7812] himself upon the bed[^h4904].
###### 48
And also thus said[^h559] the king[^h4428], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], which hath given[^h5414] one to sit[^h3427] on my throne[^h3678] this day[^h3117], mine eyes[^h5869] even seeing[^h7200] it.
###### 49
And all the guests[^h7121] that were with Adonijah[^h138] were afraid[^h2729], and rose up[^h6965], and went[^h3212] every man[^h376] his way[^h1870].
###### 50
And Adonijah[^h138] feared[^h3372] because[^h6440] of Solomon[^h8010], and arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212], and caught hold[^h2388] on the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196].
###### 51
And it was told[^h5046] Solomon[^h8010], saying[^h559], Behold, Adonijah[^h138] feareth[^h3372] king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010]: for, lo, he hath caught hold[^h270] on the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196], saying[^h559], Let king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] swear[^h7650] unto me to day[^h3117] that he will not slay[^h4191] his servant[^h5650] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 52
And Solomon[^h8010] said[^h559], If he will shew himself a worthy[^h2428] man[^h1121], there shall not an hair[^h8185] of him fall[^h5307] to the earth[^h776]: but if wickedness[^h7451] shall be found[^h4672] in him, he shall die[^h4191].
###### 53
So king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] sent[^h7971], and they brought him down[^h3381] from the altar[^h4196]. And he came[^h935] and bowed[^h7812] himself to king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010]: and Solomon[^h8010] said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212] to thine house[^h1004].

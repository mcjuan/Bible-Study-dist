###### 1
So the king[^h4428] and Haman[^h2001] came[^h935] to banquet[^h8354] with Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436]. 
###### 2
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] again unto Esther[^h635] on the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] at the banquet[^h4960] of wine[^h3196], What is thy petition[^h7596], queen[^h4436] Esther[^h635]? and it shall be granted[^h5414] thee: and what is thy request[^h1246]? and it shall be performed[^h6213], even to the half[^h2677] of the kingdom[^h4438].
###### 3
Then Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], If I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], O king[^h4428], and if it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428], let my life[^h5315] be given[^h5414] me at my petition[^h7596], and my people[^h5971] at my request[^h1246]:
###### 4
For we are sold[^h4376], I and my people[^h5971], to be destroyed[^h8045], to be slain[^h2026], and to perish[^h6]. But if[^h432] we had been sold[^h4376] for bondmen[^h5650] and bondwomen[^h8198], I had held my tongue[^h2790], although the enemy[^h6862] could not countervail[^h7737] the king's[^h4428] damage[^h5143]. 
###### 5
Then the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] answered[^h559] and said[^h559] unto Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436], Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume[^h4390] in his heart[^h3820] to do[^h6213] so? 
###### 6
And Esther[^h635] said[^h559], The adversary[^h376] [^h6862] and enemy[^h341] is this wicked[^h7451] Haman[^h2001]. Then Haman[^h2001] was afraid[^h1204] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] and the queen[^h4436].  
###### 7
And the king[^h4428] arising[^h6965] from the banquet[^h4960] of wine[^h3196] in his wrath[^h2534] went into the palace[^h1055] garden[^h1594]: and Haman[^h2001] stood up[^h5975] to make request[^h1245] for his life[^h5315] to Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436]; for he saw[^h7200] that there was evil[^h7451] determined[^h3615] against him by the king[^h4428].
###### 8
Then the king[^h4428] returned[^h7725] out of the palace[^h1055] garden[^h1594] into the place[^h1004] of the banquet[^h4960] of wine[^h3196]; and Haman[^h2001] was fallen[^h5307] upon the bed[^h4296] whereon Esther[^h635] was. Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428], Will he force[^h3533] the queen[^h4436] also before me in the house[^h1004]? As the word[^h1697] went out[^h3318] of the king's[^h4428] mouth[^h6310], they covered[^h2645] Haman's[^h2001] face[^h6440]. 
###### 9
And Harbonah[^h2726], one[^h259] of the chamberlains[^h5631], said[^h559] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], Behold also, the gallows[^h6086] fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520] high[^h1364], which Haman[^h2001] had made[^h6213] for Mordecai[^h4782], who had spoken[^h1696] good[^h2896] for the king[^h4428], standeth[^h5975] in the house[^h1004] of Haman[^h2001]. Then the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Hang[^h8518] him thereon. 
###### 10
So they hanged[^h8518] Haman[^h2001] on the gallows[^h6086] that he had prepared[^h3559] for Mordecai[^h4782]. Then was the king's[^h4428] wrath[^h2534] pacified[^h7918].

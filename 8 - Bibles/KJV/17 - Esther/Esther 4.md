###### 1
When Mordecai[^h4782] perceived[^h3045] all that was done[^h6213], Mordecai[^h4782] rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], and put on[^h3847] sackcloth[^h8242] with ashes[^h665], and went out[^h3318] into the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892], and cried[^h2199] with a loud[^h1419] and a bitter[^h4751] cry[^h2201];
###### 2
And came[^h935] even before[^h6440] the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179]: for none might enter[^h935] into the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179] clothed[^h3830] with sackcloth[^h8242].
###### 3
And in every province[^h4082], whithersoever[^h4725] the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697] and his decree[^h1881] came[^h5060], there was great[^h1419] mourning[^h60] among the Jews[^h3064], and fasting[^h6685], and weeping[^h1065], and wailing[^h4553]; and many[^h7227] lay[^h3331] in sackcloth[^h8242] and ashes[^h665]. 
###### 4
So Esther's[^h635] maids[^h5291] and her chamberlains[^h5631] came[^h935] and told[^h5046] it her. Then was the queen[^h4436] exceedingly[^h3966] grieved[^h2342]; and she sent[^h7971] raiment[^h899] to clothe[^h3847] Mordecai[^h4782], and to take away[^h5493] his sackcloth[^h8242] from him: but he received[^h6901] it not. 
###### 5
Then called[^h7121] Esther[^h635] for Hatach[^h2047], one of the king's[^h4428] chamberlains[^h5631], whom he had appointed[^h5975] to attend[^h6440] upon her, and gave him a commandment[^h6680] to Mordecai[^h4782], to know[^h3045] what it was, and why it was. 
###### 6
So Hatach[^h2047] went forth[^h3318] to Mordecai[^h4782] unto the street[^h7339] of the city[^h5892], which was before[^h6440] the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179].
###### 7
And Mordecai[^h4782] told[^h5046] him of all that had happened[^h7136] unto him, and of the sum[^h6575] of the money[^h3701] that Haman[^h2001] had promised[^h559] to pay[^h8254] to the king's[^h4428] treasuries[^h1595] for the Jews[^h3064], to destroy[^h6] them.
###### 8
Also he gave[^h5414] him the copy[^h6572] of the writing[^h3791] of the decree[^h1881] that was given[^h5414] at Shushan[^h7800] to destroy[^h8045] them, to shew[^h7200] it unto Esther[^h635], and to declare[^h5046] it unto her, and to charge[^h6680] her that she should go in[^h935] unto the king[^h4428], to make supplication[^h2603] unto him, and to make request[^h1245] before[^h6440] him for her people[^h5971].
###### 9
And Hatach[^h2047] came[^h935] and told[^h5046] Esther[^h635] the words[^h1697] of Mordecai[^h4782].
###### 10
Again Esther[^h635] spake[^h559] unto Hatach[^h2047], and gave him commandment[^h6680] unto Mordecai[^h4782];
###### 11
All the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650], and the people[^h5971] of the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082], do know[^h3045], that whosoever, whether man[^h376] or woman[^h802], shall come[^h935] unto the king[^h4428] into the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], who is not called[^h7121], there is one[^h259] law[^h1881] of his to put him to death[^h4191], except[^h905] such to whom the king[^h4428] shall hold out[^h3447] the golden[^h2091] sceptre[^h8275], that he may live[^h2421]: but I have not been called[^h7121] to come in[^h935] unto the king[^h4428] these thirty[^h7970] days[^h3117].
###### 12
And they told[^h5046] to Mordecai[^h4782] Esther's[^h635] words[^h1697].
###### 13
Then Mordecai[^h4782] commanded[^h559] to answer[^h7725] Esther[^h635], Think[^h1819] not with thyself[^h5315] that thou shalt escape[^h4422] in the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], more than all the Jews[^h3064].
###### 14
For if thou altogether[^h2790] holdest thy peace[^h2790] at this time[^h6256], then shall there enlargement[^h7305] and deliverance[^h2020] arise[^h5975] to the Jews[^h3064] from another[^h312] place[^h4725]; but thou and thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004] shall be destroyed[^h6]: and who knoweth[^h3045] whether thou art come[^h5060] to the kingdom[^h4438] for such a time[^h6256] as this? 
###### 15
Then Esther[^h635] bade[^h559] them return[^h7725] Mordecai[^h4782] this answer,
###### 16
Go[^h3212], gather together[^h3664] all the Jews[^h3064] that are present[^h4672] in Shushan[^h7800], and fast[^h6684] ye for me, and neither eat[^h398] nor drink[^h8354] three[^h7969] days[^h3117], night[^h3915] or day[^h3117]: I also and my maidens[^h5291] will fast[^h6684] likewise; and so[^h3651] will I go[^h935] in unto the king[^h4428], which is not according to the law[^h1881]: and if I perish[^h6], I perish[^h6]. 
###### 17
So Mordecai[^h4782] went his way[^h5674], and did[^h6213] according to all that Esther[^h635] had commanded[^h6680] him.

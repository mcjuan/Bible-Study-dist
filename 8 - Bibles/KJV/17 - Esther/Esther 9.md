###### 1
Now in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month[^h2320], that is, the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143], on the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the same, when the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697] and his decree[^h1881] drew near[^h5060] to be put in execution[^h6213], in the day[^h3117] that the enemies[^h341] of the Jews[^h3064] hoped[^h7663] to have power[^h7980] over them, (though it was turned[^h2015] to the contrary, that the Jews[^h3064] had rule[^h7980] over them that hated[^h8130] them;)
###### 2
The Jews[^h3064] gathered themselves together[^h6950] in their cities[^h5892] throughout all the provinces[^h4082] of the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], to lay[^h7971] hand[^h3027] on such as sought[^h1245] their hurt[^h7451]: and no man[^h376] could withstand[^h5975] them[^h6440]; for the fear[^h6343] of them fell[^h5307] upon all people[^h5971].
###### 3
And all the rulers[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082], and the lieutenants[^h323], and the deputies[^h6346], and officers[^h6213] [^h4399] of the king[^h4428], helped[^h5375] the Jews[^h3064]; because the fear[^h6343] of Mordecai[^h4782] fell[^h5307] upon them. 
###### 4
For Mordecai[^h4782] was great[^h1419] in the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and his fame[^h8089] went out[^h1980] throughout all the provinces[^h4082]: for this man[^h376] Mordecai[^h4782] waxed[^h1980] greater and greater[^h1419].
###### 5
Thus the Jews[^h3064] smote[^h5221] all their enemies[^h341] with the stroke[^h4347] of the sword[^h2719], and slaughter[^h2027], and destruction[^h12], and did[^h6213] what they would[^h7522] unto those that hated[^h8130] them. 
###### 6
And in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002] the Jews[^h3064] slew[^h2026] and destroyed[^h6] five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376].
###### 7
And Parshandatha[^h6577], and Dalphon[^h1813], and Aspatha[^h630],
###### 8
And Poratha[^h6334], and Adalia[^h118], and Aridatha[^h743],
###### 9
And Parmashta[^h6534], and Arisai[^h747], and Aridai[^h742], and Vajezatha[^h2055],
###### 10
The ten[^h6235] sons[^h1121] of Haman[^h2001] the son[^h1121] of Hammedatha[^h4099], the enemy[^h6887] of the Jews[^h3064], slew[^h2026] they; but on the spoil[^h961] laid[^h7971] they not their hand[^h3027].
###### 11
On that day[^h3117] the number[^h4557] of those that were slain[^h2026] in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002] was brought[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 12
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436], The Jews[^h3064] have slain[^h2026] and destroyed[^h6] five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002], and the ten[^h6235] sons[^h1121] of Haman[^h2001]; what have they done[^h6213] in the rest[^h7605] of the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082]? now what is thy petition[^h7596]? and it shall be granted[^h5414] thee: or what is thy request[^h1246] further[^h5750]? and it shall be done[^h6213].
###### 13
Then said[^h559] Esther[^h635], If it please[^h2896] the king[^h4428], let it be granted[^h5414] to the Jews[^h3064] which are in Shushan[^h7800] to do[^h6213] to morrow[^h4279] also according unto this day's[^h3117] decree[^h1881], and let Haman's[^h2001] ten[^h6235] sons[^h1121] be hanged[^h8518] upon the gallows[^h6086]. 
###### 14
And the king[^h4428] commanded[^h559] it so to be done[^h6213]: and the decree[^h1881] was given[^h5414] at Shushan[^h7800]; and they hanged[^h8518] Haman's[^h2001] ten[^h6235] sons[^h1121].
###### 15
For the Jews[^h3064] that were in Shushan[^h7800] gathered themselves together[^h6950] on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] also of the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143], and slew[^h2026] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] at Shushan[^h7800]; but on the prey[^h961] they laid[^h7971] not their hand[^h3027].
###### 16
But the other[^h7605] Jews[^h3064] that were in the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082] gathered themselves together[^h6950], and stood[^h5975] for their lives[^h5315], and had rest[^h5118] from their enemies[^h341], and slew[^h2026] of their foes[^h8130] seventy[^h7657] and five[^h2568] thousand[^h505], but they laid[^h7971] not their hands[^h3027] on the prey[^h961],
###### 17
On the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143]; and on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day of the same rested[^h5118] they, and made[^h6213] it a day[^h3117] of feasting[^h4960] and gladness[^h8057]. 
###### 18
But the Jews[^h3064] that were at Shushan[^h7800] assembled together[^h6950] on the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day thereof, and on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] thereof; and on the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day of the same they rested[^h5118], and made[^h6213] it a day[^h3117] of feasting[^h4960] and gladness[^h8057].
###### 19
Therefore the Jews[^h3064] of the villages[^h6521], that dwelt[^h3427] in the unwalled[^h6519] towns[^h5892], made[^h6213] the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143] a day of gladness[^h8057] and feasting[^h4960], and a good[^h2896] day[^h3117], and of sending[^h4916] portions[^h4490] one[^h376] to another[^h7453].
###### 20
And Mordecai[^h4782] wrote[^h3789] these things[^h1697], and sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] unto all the Jews[^h3064] that were in all the provinces[^h4082] of the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], both nigh[^h7138] and far[^h7350],
###### 21
To stablish[^h6965] this among them, that they should keep[^h6213] the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143], and the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the same, yearly[^h8141] [^h8141],
###### 22
As the days[^h3117] wherein the Jews[^h3064] rested[^h5117] from their enemies[^h341], and the month[^h2320] which was turned[^h2015] unto them from sorrow[^h3015] to joy[^h8057], and from mourning[^h60] into a good[^h2896] day[^h3117]: that they should make[^h6213] them days[^h3117] of feasting[^h4960] and joy[^h8057], and of sending[^h4916] portions[^h4490] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], and gifts[^h4979] to the poor[^h34].
###### 23
And the Jews[^h3064] undertook[^h6901] to do[^h6213] as they had begun[^h2490], and as Mordecai[^h4782] had written[^h3789] unto them;
###### 24
Because Haman[^h2001] the son[^h1121] of Hammedatha[^h4099], the Agagite[^h91], the enemy[^h6887] of all the Jews[^h3064], had devised[^h2803] against the Jews[^h3064] to destroy[^h6] them, and had cast[^h5307] Pur[^h6332], that is, the lot[^h1486], to consume[^h2000] them, and to destroy[^h6] them; 
###### 25
But when Esther came[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], he commanded[^h559] by letters[^h5612] that his wicked[^h7451] device[^h4284], which he devised[^h2803] against the Jews[^h3064], should return[^h7725] upon his own head[^h7218], and that he and his sons[^h1121] should be hanged[^h8518] on the gallows[^h6086]. 
###### 26
Wherefore they called[^h7121] these days[^h3117] Purim[^h6332] after the name[^h8034] of Pur[^h6332]. Therefore for all the words[^h1697] of this letter[^h107], and of that which they had seen[^h7200] concerning this matter[^h3602], and which had come[^h5060] unto them, 
###### 27
The Jews[^h3064] ordained[^h6965], and took[^h6901] upon them, and upon their seed[^h2233], and upon all such as joined[^h3867] themselves unto them, so as it should not fail[^h5674], that they would keep[^h6213] these two[^h8147] days[^h3117] according to their writing[^h3791], and according to their appointed time[^h2165] every year[^h8141] [^h8141]; 
###### 28
And that these days[^h3117] should be remembered[^h2142] and kept[^h6213] throughout[^h1755] every generation[^h1755], every family[^h4940], every province[^h4082], and every city[^h5892]; and that these days[^h3117] of Purim[^h6332] should not fail[^h5674] from among[^h8432] the Jews[^h3064], nor the memorial[^h2143] of them perish[^h5486] from their seed[^h2233].  
###### 29
Then Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436], the daughter[^h1323] of Abihail[^h32], and Mordecai[^h4782] the Jew[^h3064], wrote[^h3789] with all authority[^h8633], to confirm[^h6965] this second[^h8145] letter[^h107] of Purim[^h6332]. 
###### 30
And he sent[^h7971] the letters[^h5612] unto all the Jews[^h3064], to the hundred[^h3967] twenty[^h6242] and seven[^h7651] provinces[^h4082] of the kingdom[^h4438] of Ahasuerus[^h325], with words[^h1697] of peace[^h7965] and truth[^h571],
###### 31
To confirm[^h6965] these days[^h3117] of Purim[^h6332] in their times[^h2165] appointed, according as Mordecai[^h4782] the Jew[^h3064] and Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436] had enjoined[^h6965] them, and as they had decreed[^h6965] for themselves[^h5315] and for their seed[^h2233], the matters[^h1697] of the fastings[^h6685] and their cry[^h2201]. 
###### 32
And the decree[^h3982] of Esther[^h635] confirmed[^h6965] these matters[^h1697] of Purim[^h6332]; and it was written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612].

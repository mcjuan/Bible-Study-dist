###### 1
After[^h310] these things[^h1697] did king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] promote[^h1431] Haman[^h2001] the son[^h1121] of Hammedatha[^h4099] the Agagite[^h91], and advanced[^h5375] him, and set[^h7760] his seat[^h3678] above all the princes[^h8269] that were with him.
###### 2
And all the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650], that were in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179], bowed[^h3766], and reverenced[^h7812] Haman[^h2001]: for the king[^h4428] had so commanded[^h6680] concerning him. But Mordecai[^h4782] bowed[^h3766] not, nor did him reverence[^h7812].
###### 3
Then the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5650], which were in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179], said[^h559] unto Mordecai[^h4782], Why transgressest[^h5674] thou the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h4687]?
###### 4
Now it came to pass, when they spake[^h559] daily[^h3117] [^h3117] unto him, and he hearkened[^h8085] not unto them, that they told[^h5046] Haman[^h2001], to see[^h7200] whether Mordecai's[^h4782] matters[^h1697] would stand[^h5975]: for he had told[^h5046] them that he was a Jew[^h3064].
###### 5
And when Haman[^h2001] saw[^h7200] that Mordecai[^h4782] bowed[^h3766] not, nor did him reverence[^h7812], then was Haman[^h2001] full[^h4390] of wrath[^h2534].
###### 6
And he thought[^h5869] scorn[^h959] to lay[^h7971] hands[^h3027] on Mordecai[^h4782] alone; for they had shewed[^h5046] him the people[^h5971] of Mordecai[^h4782]: wherefore Haman[^h2001] sought[^h1245] to destroy[^h8045] all the Jews[^h3064] that were throughout the whole kingdom[^h4438] of Ahasuerus[^h325], even the people[^h5971] of Mordecai[^h4782].
###### 7
In the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], that is, the month[^h2320] Nisan[^h5212], in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], they cast[^h5307] Pur[^h6332], that is, the lot[^h1486], before[^h6440] Haman[^h2001] from day[^h3117] to day[^h3117], and from month[^h2320] to month[^h2320], to the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month, that is, the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143].
###### 8
And Haman[^h2001] said[^h559] unto king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], There is[^h3426] a certain[^h259] people[^h5971] scattered abroad[^h6340] and dispersed[^h6504] among the people[^h5971] in all the provinces[^h4082] of thy kingdom[^h4438]; and their laws[^h1881] are diverse[^h8138] from all people[^h5971]; neither keep[^h6213] they the king's[^h4428] laws[^h1881]: therefore it is not for the king's[^h4428] profit[^h7737] to suffer[^h3240] them. 
###### 9
If it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428], let it be written[^h3789] that they may be destroyed[^h6]: and I will pay[^h8254] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] talents[^h3603] of silver[^h3701] to the hands[^h3027] of those that have the charge[^h6213] of the business[^h4399], to bring[^h935] it into the king's[^h4428] treasuries[^h1595].  
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] took[^h5493] his ring[^h2885] from his hand[^h3027], and gave[^h5414] it unto Haman[^h2001] the son[^h1121] of Hammedatha[^h4099] the Agagite[^h91], the Jews'[^h3064] enemy[^h6887]. 
###### 11
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Haman[^h2001], The silver[^h3701] is given[^h5414] to thee, the people[^h5971] also, to do[^h6213] with them as it seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] to thee.
###### 12
Then were the king's[^h4428] scribes[^h5608] called[^h7121] on the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], and there was written[^h3789] according to all that Haman[^h2001] had commanded[^h6680] unto the king's[^h4428] lieutenants[^h323], and to the governors[^h6346] that were over every province[^h4082], and to the rulers[^h8269] of every people[^h5971] of every province[^h4082] according to the writing[^h3791] thereof, and to every people[^h5971] after their language[^h3956]; in the name[^h8034] of king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] was it written[^h3789], and sealed[^h2856] with the king's[^h4428] ring[^h2885]. 
###### 13
And the letters[^h5612] were sent[^h7971] by[^h3027] posts[^h7323] into all the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082], to destroy[^h8045], to kill[^h2026], and to cause to perish[^h6], all Jews[^h3064], both young[^h5288] and old[^h2205], little children[^h2945] and women[^h802], in one[^h259] day[^h3117], even upon the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day of the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month[^h2320], which is the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143], and to take the spoil[^h7998] of them for a prey[^h962].
###### 14
The copy[^h6572] of the writing[^h3791] for a commandment[^h1881] to be given[^h5414] in every province[^h4082] was published[^h1540] unto all people[^h5971], that they should be ready[^h6264] against that day[^h3117].
###### 15
The posts[^h7323] went out[^h3318], being hastened[^h1765] by the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697], and the decree[^h1881] was given[^h5414] in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002]. And the king[^h4428] and Haman[^h2001] sat down[^h3427] to drink[^h8354]; but the city[^h5892] Shushan[^h7800] was perplexed[^h943].

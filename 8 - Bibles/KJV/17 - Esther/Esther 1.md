###### 1
Now it came to pass in the days[^h3117] of Ahasuerus[^h325], (this is Ahasuerus[^h325] which reigned[^h4427], from India[^h1912] even unto Ethiopia[^h3568], over an hundred[^h3967] and seven[^h7651] and twenty[^h6242] provinces[^h4082]:)
###### 2
That in those days[^h3117], when the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] sat[^h3427] on the throne[^h3678] of his kingdom[^h4438], which was in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002],
###### 3
In the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], he made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960] unto all his princes[^h8269] and his servants[^h5650]; the power[^h2428] of Persia[^h6539] and Media[^h4074], the nobles[^h6579] and princes[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082], being before[^h6440] him:
###### 4
When he shewed[^h7200] the riches[^h6239] of his glorious[^h3519] kingdom[^h4438] and the honour[^h3366] of his excellent[^h8597] majesty[^h1420] many[^h7227] days[^h3117], even an hundred[^h3967] and fourscore[^h8084] days[^h3117].
###### 5
And when these days[^h3117] were expired[^h4390], the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960] unto all the people[^h5971] that were present[^h4672] in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002], both unto great[^h1419] and small[^h6996], seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], in the court[^h2691] of the garden[^h1594] of the king's[^h4428] palace[^h1055]; 
###### 6
Where were white[^h2353], green[^h3768], and blue[^h8504], hangings, fastened[^h270] with cords[^h2256] of fine linen[^h948] and purple[^h713] to silver[^h3701] rings[^h1550] and pillars[^h5982] of marble[^h8336]: the beds[^h4296] were of gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701], upon a pavement[^h7531] of red[^h923], and blue[^h8504], and white[^h1858], and black[^h5508], marble[^h8336].  
###### 7
And they gave them drink[^h8248] in vessels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], (the vessels[^h3627] being diverse[^h8138] one from another[^h3627],) and royal[^h4438] wine[^h3196] in abundance[^h7227], according to the state[^h3027] of the king[^h4428].  
###### 8
And the drinking[^h8360] was according to the law[^h1881]; none did compel[^h597]: for so the king[^h4428] had appointed[^h3245] to all the officers[^h7227] of his house[^h1004], that they should do[^h6213] according to every man's[^h376] pleasure[^h7522].
###### 9
Also Vashti[^h2060] the queen[^h4436] made[^h6213] a feast[^h4960] for the women[^h802] in the royal[^h4438] house[^h1004] which belonged to king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325].
###### 10
On the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], when the heart[^h3820] of the king[^h4428] was merry[^h2896] with wine[^h3196], he commanded[^h559] Mehuman[^h4104], Biztha[^h968], Harbona[^h2726], Bigtha[^h903], and Abagtha[^h5], Zethar[^h2242], and Carcas[^h3752], the seven[^h7651] chamberlains[^h5631] that served[^h8334] in the presence[^h6440] of Ahasuerus[^h325] the king[^h4428], 
###### 11
To bring[^h935] Vashti[^h2060] the queen[^h4436] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] with the crown[^h3804] royal[^h4438], to shew[^h7200] the people[^h5971] and the princes[^h8269] her beauty[^h3308]: for she was fair[^h2896] to look on[^h4758]. 
###### 12
But the queen[^h4436] Vashti[^h2060] refused[^h3985] to come[^h935] at the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697] by[^h3027] his chamberlains[^h5631]: therefore was the king[^h4428] very[^h3966] wroth[^h7107], and his anger[^h2534] burned[^h1197] in him. 
###### 13
Then the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to the wise men[^h2450], which knew[^h3045] the times[^h6256], (for so was the king's[^h4428] manner[^h1697] toward[^h6440] all that knew[^h3045] law[^h1881] and judgment[^h1779]:
###### 14
And the next[^h7138] unto him was Carshena[^h3771], Shethar[^h8369], Admatha[^h133], Tarshish[^h8659], Meres[^h4825], Marsena[^h4826], and Memucan[^h4462], the seven[^h7651] princes[^h8269] of Persia[^h6539] and Media[^h4074], which saw[^h7200] the king's[^h4428] face[^h6440], and which sat[^h3427] the first[^h7223] in the kingdom[^h4438];)
###### 15
What shall we do[^h6213] unto the queen[^h4436] Vashti[^h2060] according to law[^h1881], because she hath not performed[^h6213] the commandment[^h3982] of the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] by[^h3027] the chamberlains[^h5631]? 
###### 16
And Memucan[^h4462] answered[^h559] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] and the princes[^h8269], Vashti[^h2060] the queen[^h4436] hath not done wrong[^h5753] to the king[^h4428] only, but also to all the princes[^h8269], and to all the people[^h5971] that are in all the provinces[^h4082] of the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325].
###### 17
For this deed[^h1697] of the queen[^h4436] shall come abroad[^h3318] unto all women[^h802], so that they shall despise[^h959] their husbands[^h1167] in their eyes[^h5869], when it shall be reported[^h559], The king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] commanded[^h559] Vashti[^h2060] the queen[^h4436] to be brought in[^h935] before[^h6440] him, but she came[^h935] not.
###### 18
Likewise shall the ladies[^h8282] of Persia[^h6539] and Media[^h4074] say[^h559] this day[^h3117] unto all the king's[^h4428] princes[^h8269], which have heard[^h8085] of the deed[^h1697] of the queen[^h4436]. Thus shall there arise too much[^h1767] contempt[^h963] and wrath[^h7110].
###### 19
If it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428], let there go[^h3318] a royal[^h4438] commandment[^h1697] from him[^h6440], and let it be written[^h3789] among the laws[^h1881] of the Persians[^h6539] and the Medes[^h4074], that it be not altered[^h5674], That Vashti[^h2060] come[^h935] no more before[^h6440] king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325]; and let the king[^h4428] give[^h5414] her royal estate[^h4438] unto another[^h7468] that is better[^h2896] than she.    
###### 20
And when the king's[^h4428] decree[^h6599] which he shall make[^h6213] shall be published[^h8085] throughout all his empire[^h4438], (for it is great[^h7227],) all the wives[^h802] shall give[^h5414] to their husbands[^h1167] honour[^h3366], both to great[^h1419] and small[^h6996].
###### 21
And the saying[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] the king[^h4428] and the princes[^h8269]; and the king[^h4428] did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Memucan[^h4462]: 
###### 22
For he sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] into all the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082], into every province[^h4082] according to the writing[^h3791] thereof, and to every people[^h5971] after their language[^h3956], that every man[^h376] should bear rule[^h8323] in his own house[^h1004], and that it should be published[^h1696] according to the language[^h3956] of every people[^h5971].

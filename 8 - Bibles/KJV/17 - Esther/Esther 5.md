###### 1
Now it came to pass on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], that Esther[^h635] put on[^h3847] her royal[^h4438] apparel, and stood[^h5975] in the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], over against[^h5227] the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]: and the king[^h4428] sat[^h3427] upon his royal[^h4438] throne[^h3678] in the royal[^h4438] house[^h1004], over against[^h5227] the gate[^h6607] of the house[^h1004].
###### 2
And it was so, when the king[^h4428] saw[^h7200] Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436] standing[^h5975] in the court[^h2691], that she obtained[^h5375] favour[^h2580] in his sight[^h5869]: and the king[^h4428] held out[^h3447] to Esther[^h635] the golden[^h2091] sceptre[^h8275] that was in his hand[^h3027]. So Esther[^h635] drew near[^h7126], and touched[^h5060] the top[^h7218] of the sceptre[^h8275].
###### 3
Then said[^h559] the king[^h4428] unto her, What wilt thou, queen[^h4436] Esther[^h635]? and what is thy request[^h1246]? it shall be even given[^h5414] thee to the half[^h2677] of the kingdom[^h4438].
###### 4
And Esther[^h635] answered[^h559], If it seem good[^h2895] unto the king[^h4428], let the king[^h4428] and Haman[^h2001] come[^h935] this day[^h3117] unto the banquet[^h4960] that I have prepared[^h6213] for him.
###### 5
Then the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Cause Haman[^h2001] to make haste[^h4116], that he may do[^h6213] as Esther[^h635] hath said[^h1697]. So the king[^h4428] and Haman[^h2001] came[^h935] to the banquet[^h4960] that Esther[^h635] had prepared[^h6213].
###### 6
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Esther[^h635] at the banquet[^h4960] of wine[^h3196], What is thy petition[^h7596]? and it shall be granted[^h5414] thee: and what is thy request[^h1246]? even to the half[^h2677] of the kingdom[^h4438] it shall be performed[^h6213].
###### 7
Then answered[^h6030] Esther[^h635], and said[^h559], My petition[^h7596] and my request[^h1246] is;
###### 8
If I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of the king[^h4428], and if it please[^h2895] the king[^h4428] to grant[^h5414] my petition[^h7596], and to perform[^h6213] my request[^h1246], let the king[^h4428] and Haman[^h2001] come[^h935] to the banquet[^h4960] that I shall prepare[^h6213] for them, and I will do[^h6213] to morrow[^h4279] as the king[^h4428] hath said[^h1697]. 
###### 9
Then went[^h3318] Haman[^h2001] forth[^h3318] that day[^h3117] joyful[^h8056] and with a glad[^h2896] heart[^h3820]: but when Haman[^h2001] saw[^h7200] Mordecai[^h4782] in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179], that he stood not up[^h6965], nor moved[^h2111] for him, he[^h2001] was full[^h4390] of indignation[^h2534] against Mordecai[^h4782].
###### 10
Nevertheless Haman[^h2001] refrained[^h662] himself: and when he came[^h935] home[^h1004], he sent[^h7971] and called[^h935] for his friends[^h157], and Zeresh[^h2238] his wife[^h802]. 
###### 11
And Haman[^h2001] told[^h5608] them of the glory[^h3519] of his riches[^h6239], and the multitude[^h7230] of his children[^h1121], and all the things wherein the king[^h4428] had promoted[^h1431] him, and how he had advanced[^h5375] him above the princes[^h8269] and servants[^h5650] of the king[^h4428].
###### 12
Haman[^h2001] said[^h559] moreover, Yea, Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436] did let no man come in[^h935] with the king[^h4428] unto the banquet[^h4960] that she had prepared[^h6213] but myself; and to morrow[^h4279] am I invited[^h7121] unto her also with the king[^h4428].
###### 13
Yet all this availeth[^h7737] me nothing, so long as[^h6256] I see[^h7200] Mordecai[^h4782] the Jew[^h3064] sitting[^h3427] at the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179].
###### 14
Then said[^h559] Zeresh[^h2238] his wife[^h802] and all his friends[^h157] unto him, Let a gallows[^h6086] be made[^h6213] of fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520] high[^h1364], and to morrow[^h1242] speak[^h559] thou unto the king[^h4428] that Mordecai[^h4782] may be hanged[^h8518] thereon: then go[^h935] thou in merrily[^h8056] with the king[^h4428] unto the banquet[^h4960]. And the thing[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h6440] Haman[^h2001]; and he caused[^h6213] the gallows[^h6086] to be made[^h6213].

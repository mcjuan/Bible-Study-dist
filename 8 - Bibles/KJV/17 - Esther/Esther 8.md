###### 1
On that day[^h3117] did the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] give[^h5414] the house[^h1004] of Haman[^h2001] the Jews'[^h3064] enemy[^h6887] unto Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436]. And Mordecai[^h4782] came[^h935] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]; for Esther[^h635] had told[^h5046] what he was unto her.
###### 2
And the king[^h4428] took off[^h5493] his ring[^h2885], which he had taken[^h5674] from Haman[^h2001], and gave[^h5414] it unto Mordecai[^h4782]. And Esther[^h635] set[^h7760] Mordecai[^h4782] over the house[^h1004] of Haman[^h2001].
###### 3
And Esther[^h635] spake[^h1696] yet again[^h3254] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], and fell down[^h5307] at[^h6440] his feet[^h7272], and besought[^h2603] him with tears[^h1058] to put away[^h5674] the mischief[^h7451] of Haman[^h2001] the Agagite[^h91], and his device[^h4284] that he had devised[^h2803] against the Jews[^h3064]. 
###### 4
Then the king[^h4428] held out[^h3447] the golden[^h2091] sceptre[^h8275] toward Esther[^h635]. So Esther[^h635] arose[^h6965], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428],
###### 5
And said[^h559], If it please[^h2896] the king[^h4428], and if I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in his sight[^h6440], and the thing[^h1697] seem right[^h3787] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], and I be pleasing[^h2896] in his eyes[^h5869], let it be written[^h3789] to reverse[^h7725] the letters[^h5612] devised[^h4284] by Haman[^h2001] the son[^h1121] of Hammedatha[^h4099] the Agagite[^h91], which he wrote[^h3789] to destroy[^h6] the Jews[^h3064] which are in all the king's[^h4428] provinces[^h4082]:  
###### 6
For how[^h349] can I endure[^h3201] to see[^h7200] the evil[^h7451] that shall come[^h4672] unto my people[^h5971]? or how[^h349] can I endure[^h3201] to see[^h7200] the destruction[^h13] of my kindred[^h4138]? 
###### 7
Then the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] said[^h559] unto Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436] and to Mordecai[^h4782] the Jew[^h3064], Behold, I have given[^h5414] Esther[^h635] the house[^h1004] of Haman[^h2001], and him they have hanged[^h8518] upon the gallows[^h6086], because he laid[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] upon the Jews[^h3064].
###### 8
Write[^h3789] ye also for the Jews[^h3064], as it liketh[^h2896] you[^h5869], in the king's[^h4428] name[^h8034], and seal[^h2856] it with the king's[^h4428] ring[^h2885]: for the writing[^h3791] which is written[^h3789] in the king's[^h4428] name[^h8034], and sealed[^h2856] with the king's[^h4428] ring[^h2885], may no man reverse[^h7725].
###### 9
Then were the king's[^h4428] scribes[^h5608] called[^h7121] at that time[^h6256] in the third[^h7992] month[^h2320], that is, the month[^h2320] Sivan[^h5510], on the three[^h7969] and twentieth[^h6242] day thereof; and it was written[^h3789] according to all that Mordecai[^h4782] commanded[^h6680] unto the Jews[^h3064], and to the lieutenants[^h323], and the deputies[^h6346] and rulers[^h8269] of the provinces[^h4082] which are from India[^h1912] unto Ethiopia[^h3568], an hundred[^h3967] twenty[^h6242] and seven[^h7651] provinces[^h4082], unto every province[^h4082] according to the writing[^h3791] thereof, and unto every people[^h5971] after their language[^h3956], and to the Jews[^h3064] according to their writing[^h3791], and according to their language[^h3956].
###### 10
And he wrote[^h3789] in the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus'[^h325] name[^h8034], and sealed[^h2856] it with the king's[^h4428] ring[^h2885], and sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] by[^h3027] posts[^h7323] on horseback[^h5483], and riders[^h7392] on mules[^h7409], camels[^h327], and young[^h1121] dromedaries[^h7424]:
###### 11
Wherein the king[^h4428] granted[^h5414] the Jews[^h3064] which were in every city[^h5892] to gather themselves together[^h6950], and to stand[^h5975] for their life[^h5315], to destroy[^h8045], to slay[^h2026], and to cause to perish[^h6], all the power[^h2428] of the people[^h5971] and province[^h4082] that would assault[^h6696] them, both little ones[^h2945] and women[^h802], and to take the spoil[^h7998] of them for a prey[^h962],
###### 12
Upon one[^h259] day[^h3117] in all the provinces[^h4082] of king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], namely, upon the thirteenth[^h7969] [^h6240] day of the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month[^h2320], which is the month[^h2320] Adar[^h143].
###### 13
The copy[^h6572] of the writing[^h3791] for a commandment[^h1881] to be given[^h5414] in every province[^h4082] was published[^h1540] unto all people[^h5971], and that the Jews[^h3064] should be ready[^h6264] [^h6259] against that day[^h3117] to avenge[^h5358] themselves on their enemies[^h341]. 
###### 14
So the posts[^h7323] that rode[^h7392] upon mules[^h7409] and camels[^h327] went out[^h3318], being hastened[^h926] and pressed on[^h1765] by the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697]. And the decree[^h1881] was given[^h5414] at Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002].
###### 15
And Mordecai[^h4782] went out[^h3318] from the presence[^h6440] of the king[^h4428] in royal[^h4438] apparel[^h3830] of blue[^h8504] and white[^h2353], and with a great[^h1419] crown[^h5850] of gold[^h2091], and with a garment[^h8509] of fine linen[^h948] and purple[^h713]: and the city[^h5892] of Shushan[^h7800] rejoiced[^h6670] and was glad[^h8056]. 
###### 16
The Jews[^h3064] had light[^h219], and gladness[^h8057], and joy[^h8342], and honour[^h3366].
###### 17
And in every province[^h4082], and in every city[^h5892], whithersoever[^h4725] the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697] and his decree[^h1881] came[^h5060], the Jews[^h3064] had joy[^h8057] and gladness[^h8342], a feast[^h4960] and a good[^h2896] day[^h3117]. And many[^h7227] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] became Jews[^h3054]; for the fear[^h6343] of the Jews[^h3064] fell[^h5307] upon them.

###### 1
On that night[^h3915] could not[^h5074] the king[^h4428] sleep[^h8142], and he commanded[^h559] to bring[^h935] the book[^h5612] of records[^h2146] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117]; and they were read[^h7121] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 2
And it was found[^h4672] written[^h3789], that Mordecai[^h4782] had told[^h5046] of Bigthana[^h904] and Teresh[^h8657], two[^h8147] of the king's[^h4428] chamberlains[^h5631], the keepers[^h8104] of the door[^h5592], who sought[^h1245] to lay[^h7971] hand[^h3027] on the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325].  
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], What honour[^h3366] and dignity[^h1420] hath been done[^h6213] to Mordecai[^h4782] for this? Then said[^h559] the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5288] that ministered[^h8334] unto him, There is nothing[^h1697] done[^h6213] for him.
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Who is in the court[^h2691]? Now Haman[^h2001] was come[^h935] into the outward[^h2435] court[^h2691] of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], to speak[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] to hang[^h8518] Mordecai[^h4782] on the gallows[^h6086] that he had prepared[^h3559] for him.
###### 5
And the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5288] said[^h559] unto him, Behold, Haman[^h2001] standeth[^h5975] in the court[^h2691]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Let him come in[^h935].
###### 6
So Haman[^h2001] came in[^h935]. And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto him, What shall be done[^h6213] unto the man[^h376] whom the king[^h4428] delighteth[^h2654] to honour[^h3366]? Now Haman[^h2001] thought[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], To whom would the king[^h4428] delight[^h2654] to do[^h6213] honour[^h3366] more[^h3148] than to myself? 
###### 7
And Haman[^h2001] answered[^h559] the king[^h4428], For the man[^h376] whom the king[^h4428] delighteth[^h2654] to honour[^h3366], 
###### 8
Let the royal[^h4438] apparel[^h3830] be brought[^h935] which the king[^h4428] useth to wear[^h3847], and the horse[^h5483] that the king[^h4428] rideth[^h7392] upon, and the crown[^h3804] royal[^h4438] which is set[^h5414] upon his head[^h7218]:  
###### 9
And let this apparel[^h3830] and horse[^h5483] be delivered[^h5414] to the hand[^h3027] of one[^h376] of the king's[^h4428] most noble[^h6579] princes[^h8269], that they may array[^h3847] the man[^h376] withal whom the king[^h4428] delighteth[^h2654] to honour[^h3366], and bring[^h7392] him on horseback[^h5483] through the street[^h7339] of the city[^h5892], and proclaim[^h7121] before[^h6440] him, Thus shall it be done[^h6213] to the man[^h376] whom the king[^h4428] delighteth[^h2654] to honour[^h3366]. 
###### 10
Then the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to Haman[^h2001], Make haste[^h4116], and take[^h3947] the apparel[^h3830] and the horse[^h5483], as thou hast said[^h1696], and do[^h6213] even so to Mordecai[^h4782] the Jew[^h3064], that sitteth[^h3427] at the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179]: let nothing[^h1697] fail[^h5307] of all that thou hast spoken[^h1696]. 
###### 11
Then took[^h3947] Haman[^h2001] the apparel[^h3830] and the horse[^h5483], and arrayed[^h3847] Mordecai[^h4782], and brought him on horseback[^h7392] through the street[^h7339] of the city[^h5892], and proclaimed[^h7121] before[^h6440] him, Thus shall it be done[^h6213] unto the man[^h376] whom the king[^h4428] delighteth[^h2654] to honour[^h3366].
###### 12
And Mordecai[^h4782] came again[^h7725] to the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179]. But Haman[^h2001] hasted[^h1765] to his house[^h1004] mourning[^h57], and having his head[^h7218] covered[^h2645].
###### 13
And Haman[^h2001] told[^h5608] Zeresh[^h2238] his wife[^h802] and all his friends[^h157] every thing that had befallen[^h7136] him. Then said[^h559] his wise men[^h2450] and Zeresh[^h2238] his wife[^h802] unto him, If Mordecai[^h4782] be of the seed[^h2233] of the Jews[^h3064], before[^h6440] whom thou hast begun[^h2490] to fall[^h5307], thou shalt not prevail[^h3201] against him, but shalt surely[^h5307] fall[^h5307] before[^h6440] him.
###### 14
And while they were yet talking[^h1696] with him, came[^h5060] the king's[^h4428] chamberlains[^h5631], and hasted[^h926] to bring[^h935] Haman[^h2001] unto the banquet[^h4960] that Esther[^h635] had prepared[^h6213].

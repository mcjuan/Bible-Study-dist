###### 1
After[^h310] these things[^h1697], when the wrath[^h2534] of king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] was appeased[^h7918], he remembered[^h2142] Vashti[^h2060], and what she had done[^h6213], and what was decreed[^h1504] against her.
###### 2
Then said[^h559] the king's[^h4428] servants[^h5288] that ministered[^h8334] unto him, Let there be fair[^h2896] [^h4758] young[^h5291] virgins[^h1330] sought[^h1245] for the king[^h4428]:
###### 3
And let the king[^h4428] appoint[^h6485] officers[^h6496] in all the provinces[^h4082] of his kingdom[^h4438], that they may gather together[^h6908] all the fair[^h2896] [^h4758] young[^h5291] virgins[^h1330] unto Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002], to the house[^h1004] of the women[^h802], unto the custody[^h3027] of Hege[^h1896] the king's[^h4428] chamberlain[^h5631], keeper[^h8104] of the women[^h802]; and let their things for purification[^h8562] be given[^h5414] them:  
###### 4
And let the maiden[^h5291] which pleaseth[^h3190] [^h5869] the king[^h4428] be queen[^h4427] instead of Vashti[^h2060]. And the thing[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] the king[^h4428]; and he did so[^h6213].
###### 5
Now in Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002] there was a certain[^h376] Jew[^h3064], whose name[^h8034] was Mordecai[^h4782], the son[^h1121] of Jair[^h2971], the son[^h1121] of Shimei[^h8096], the son[^h1121] of Kish[^h7027], a Benjamite[^h1145];
###### 6
Who had been carried away[^h1540] from Jerusalem[^h3389] with the captivity[^h1473] which had been carried away[^h1540] with Jeconiah[^h3204] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], whom Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had carried away[^h1540]. 
###### 7
And he brought up[^h539] Hadassah[^h1919], that is, Esther[^h635], his uncle's[^h1730] daughter[^h1323]: for she had neither father[^h1] nor mother[^h517], and the maid[^h5291] was fair[^h3303] [^h8389] and beautiful[^h2896] [^h4758]; whom Mordecai[^h4782], when her father[^h1] and mother[^h517] were dead[^h4194], took[^h3947] for his own daughter[^h1323].  
###### 8
So it came to pass, when the king's[^h4428] commandment[^h1697] and his decree[^h1881] was heard[^h8085], and when many[^h7227] maidens[^h5291] were gathered together[^h6908] unto Shushan[^h7800] the palace[^h1002], to the custody[^h3027] of Hegai[^h1896], that Esther[^h635] was brought[^h3947] also unto the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], to the custody[^h3027] of Hegai[^h1896], keeper[^h8104] of the women[^h802].
###### 9
And the maiden[^h5291] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] him, and she obtained[^h5375] kindness[^h2617] of him[^h6440]; and he speedily[^h926] gave[^h5414] her her things for purification[^h8562], with such things as belonged[^h4490] to her, and seven[^h7651] maidens[^h5291], which were meet[^h7200] to be given[^h5414] her, out of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]: and he preferred[^h8138] her and her maids[^h5291] unto the best[^h2896] place of the house[^h1004] of the women[^h802].  
###### 10
Esther[^h635] had not shewed[^h5046] her people[^h5971] nor her kindred[^h4138]: for Mordecai[^h4782] had charged[^h6680] her that she should not shew[^h5046] it.
###### 11
And Mordecai[^h4782] walked[^h1980] every day[^h3117] before[^h6440] the court[^h2691] of the women's[^h802] house[^h1004], to know[^h3045] how Esther[^h635] did[^h7965], and what should become[^h6213] of her. 
###### 12
Now when every maid's[^h5291] turn[^h8447] was come[^h5060] to go in[^h935] to king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325], after[^h7093] that she had been twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] months[^h2320], according to the manner[^h1881] of the women[^h802], (for so were the days[^h3117] of their purifications[^h4795] accomplished[^h4390], to wit, six[^h8337] months[^h2320] with oil[^h8081] of myrrh[^h4753], and six[^h8337] months[^h2320] with sweet odours[^h1314], and with other things for the purifying[^h8562] of the women[^h802];)
###### 13
Then thus came[^h935] every maiden[^h5291] unto the king[^h4428]; whatsoever she desired[^h559] was given[^h5414] her to go[^h935] with her out of the house[^h1004] of the women[^h802] unto the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004].
###### 14
In the evening[^h6153] she went[^h935], and on the morrow[^h1242] she returned[^h7725] into the second[^h8145] house[^h1004] of the women[^h802], to the custody[^h3027] of Shaashgaz[^h8190], the king's[^h4428] chamberlain[^h5631], which kept[^h8104] the concubines[^h6370]: she came in[^h935] unto the king[^h4428] no more, except the king[^h4428] delighted[^h2654] in her, and that she were called[^h7121] by name[^h8034].
###### 15
Now when the turn[^h8447] of Esther[^h635], the daughter[^h1323] of Abihail[^h32] the uncle[^h1730] of Mordecai[^h4782], who had taken[^h3947] her for his daughter[^h1323], was come[^h5060] to go in[^h935] unto the king[^h4428], she required[^h1245] nothing[^h1697] but what Hegai[^h1896] the king's[^h4428] chamberlain[^h5631], the keeper[^h8104] of the women[^h802], appointed[^h559]. And Esther[^h635] obtained[^h5375] favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of all them that looked[^h7200] upon her.
###### 16
So Esther[^h635] was taken[^h3947] unto king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325] into his house[^h1004] royal[^h4438] in the tenth[^h6224] month[^h2320], which is the month[^h2320] Tebeth[^h2887], in the seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4438].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] loved[^h157] Esther[^h635] above all the women[^h802], and she obtained[^h5375] grace[^h2580] and favour[^h2617] in his sight[^h6440] more than all the virgins[^h1330]; so that he set[^h7760] the royal[^h4438] crown[^h3804] upon her head[^h7218], and made her queen[^h4427] instead of Vashti[^h2060].  
###### 18
Then the king[^h4428] made[^h6213] a great[^h1419] feast[^h4960] unto all his princes[^h8269] and his servants[^h5650], even Esther's[^h635] feast[^h4960]; and he made[^h6213] a release[^h2010] to the provinces[^h4082], and gave[^h5414] gifts[^h4864], according to the state[^h3027] of the king[^h4428]. 
###### 19
And when the virgins[^h1330] were gathered together[^h6908] the second time[^h8145], then Mordecai[^h4782] sat[^h3427] in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179].
###### 20
Esther[^h635] had not yet shewed[^h5046] her kindred[^h4138] nor her people[^h5971]; as Mordecai[^h4782] had charged[^h6680] her: for Esther[^h635] did[^h6213] the commandment[^h3982] of Mordecai[^h4782], like as when she was brought up[^h545] with him.
###### 21
In those days[^h3117], while Mordecai[^h4782] sat[^h3427] in the king's[^h4428] gate[^h8179], two[^h8147] of the king's[^h4428] chamberlains[^h5631], Bigthan[^h904] and Teresh[^h8657], of those which kept[^h8104] the door[^h5592], were wroth[^h7107], and sought[^h1245] to lay[^h7971] hand[^h3027] on the king[^h4428] Ahasuerus[^h325].  
###### 22
And the thing[^h1697] was known[^h3045] to Mordecai[^h4782], who told[^h5046] it unto Esther[^h635] the queen[^h4436]; and Esther[^h635] certified[^h559] the king[^h4428] thereof in Mordecai's[^h4782] name[^h8034].
###### 23
And when inquisition[^h1245] was made of the matter[^h1697], it was found out[^h4672]; therefore they were both[^h8147] hanged[^h8518] on a tree[^h6086]: and it was written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the chronicles[^h1697] [^h3117] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].

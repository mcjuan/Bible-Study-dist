###### 1
And this is the blessing[^h1293], wherewith Moses[^h4872] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] blessed[^h1288] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] before[^h6440] his death[^h4194].
###### 2
And he said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] came[^h935] from Sinai[^h5514], and rose up[^h2224] from Seir[^h8165] unto them; he shined forth[^h3313] from mount[^h2022] Paran[^h6290], and he came[^h857] with ten thousands[^h7233] of saints[^h6944]: from his right hand[^h3225] went a fiery[^h799] [^h784] law[^h1881] for them. 
###### 3
Yea[^h637], he loved[^h2245] the people[^h5971]; all his saints[^h6918] are in thy hand[^h3027]: and they sat down[^h8497] at thy feet[^h7272]; every one shall receive[^h5375] of thy words[^h1703].
###### 4
Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] us a law[^h8451], even the inheritance[^h4181] of the congregation[^h6952] of Jacob[^h3290].
###### 5
And he was king[^h4428] in Jeshurun[^h3484], when the heads[^h7218] of the people[^h5971] and the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] were gathered[^h622] together[^h3162].
###### 6
Let Reuben[^h7205] live[^h2421], and not die[^h4191]; and let not his men[^h4962] be few[^h4557].
###### 7
And this is the blessing of Judah[^h3063]: and he said[^h559], Hear[^h8085], LORD[^h3068], the voice[^h6963] of Judah[^h3063], and bring[^h935] him unto his people[^h5971]: let his hands[^h3027] be sufficient[^h7227] for him; and be thou an help[^h5828] to him from his enemies[^h6862].
###### 8
And of Levi[^h3878] he said[^h559], Let thy Thummim[^h8550] and thy Urim[^h224] be with thy holy[^h2623] one[^h376], whom thou didst prove[^h5254] at Massah[^h4532], and with whom thou didst strive[^h7378] at the waters[^h4325] of Meribah[^h4809];
###### 9
Who said[^h559] unto his father[^h1] and to his mother[^h517], I have not seen[^h7200] him; neither did he acknowledge[^h5234] his brethren[^h251], nor knew[^h3045] his own children[^h1121]: for they have observed[^h8104] thy word[^h565], and kept[^h5341] thy covenant[^h1285].
###### 10
They shall teach[^h3384] Jacob[^h3290] thy judgments[^h4941], and Israel[^h3478] thy law[^h8451]: they shall put[^h7760] incense[^h6988] before[^h639] thee, and whole burnt sacrifice[^h3632] upon thine altar[^h4196].   
###### 11
Bless[^h1288], LORD[^h3068], his substance[^h2428], and accept[^h7521] the work[^h6467] of his hands[^h3027]: smite[^h4272] through the loins[^h4975] of them that rise[^h6965] against him, and of them that hate[^h8130] him, that they rise[^h6965] not[^h4480] again[^h6965].
###### 12
And of Benjamin[^h1144] he said[^h559], The beloved[^h3039] of the LORD[^h3068] shall dwell[^h7931] in safety[^h983] by him; and the LORD shall cover[^h2653] him all the day[^h3117] long, and he shall dwell[^h7931] between his shoulders[^h3802].
###### 13
And of Joseph[^h3130] he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] of the LORD[^h3068] be his land[^h776], for the precious things[^h4022] of heaven[^h8064], for the dew[^h2919], and for the deep[^h8415] that coucheth beneath[^h7257],
###### 14
And for the precious[^h4022] fruits[^h8393] brought forth by the sun[^h8121], and for the precious things[^h4022] put forth[^h1645] by the moon[^h3391],  
###### 15
And for the chief things[^h7218] of the ancient[^h6924] mountains[^h2042], and for the precious things[^h4022] of the lasting[^h5769] hills[^h1389],
###### 16
And for the precious things[^h4022] of the earth[^h776] and fulness[^h4393] thereof, and for the good will[^h7522] of him that dwelt[^h7931] in the bush[^h5572]: let the blessing come[^h935] upon the head[^h7218] of Joseph[^h3130], and upon the top of the head[^h6936] of him that was separated[^h5139] from his brethren[^h251].
###### 17
His glory[^h1926] is like the firstling[^h1060] of his bullock[^h7794], and his horns[^h7161] are like the horns[^h7161] of unicorns[^h7214]: with them he shall push[^h5055] the people[^h5971] together[^h3162] to the ends[^h657] of the earth[^h776]: and they are the ten thousands[^h7233] of Ephraim[^h669], and they are the thousands[^h505] of Manasseh[^h4519]. 
###### 18
And of Zebulun[^h2074] he said[^h559], Rejoice[^h8055], Zebulun[^h2074], in thy going out[^h3318]; and, Issachar[^h3485], in thy tents[^h168].
###### 19
They shall call[^h7121] the people[^h5971] unto the mountain[^h2022]; there they shall offer[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] of righteousness[^h6664]: for they shall suck[^h3243] of the abundance[^h8228] of the seas[^h3220], and of treasures[^h8226] hid[^h2934] in the sand[^h2344].
###### 20
And of Gad[^h1410] he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be he that enlargeth[^h7337] Gad[^h1410]: he dwelleth[^h7931] as a lion[^h3833], and teareth[^h2963] the arm[^h2220] with[^h637] the crown of the head[^h6936].
###### 21
And he provided[^h7200] the first part[^h7225] for himself, because there, in a portion[^h2513] of the lawgiver[^h2710], was he seated[^h5603]; and he came[^h857] with the heads[^h7218] of the people[^h5971], he executed[^h6213] the justice[^h6666] of the LORD[^h3068], and his judgments[^h4941] with Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 22
And of Dan[^h1835] he said[^h559], Dan[^h1835] is a lion's[^h738] whelp[^h1482]: he shall leap[^h2187] from Bashan[^h1316].
###### 23
And of Naphtali[^h5321] he said[^h559], O Naphtali[^h5321], satisfied[^h7649] with favour[^h7522], and full[^h4392] with the blessing[^h1293] of the LORD[^h3068]: possess[^h3423] thou the west[^h3220] and the south[^h1864].
###### 24
And of Asher[^h836] he said[^h559], Let Asher[^h836] be blessed[^h1288] with children[^h1121]; let him be acceptable[^h7521] to his brethren[^h251], and let him dip[^h2881] his foot[^h7272] in oil[^h8081].
###### 25
Thy shoes[^h4515] shall be iron[^h1270] and brass[^h5178]; and as thy days[^h3117], so shall thy strength[^h1679] be. 
###### 26
There is none like unto the God[^h410] of Jeshurun[^h3484], who rideth[^h7392] upon the heaven[^h8064] in thy help[^h5828], and in his excellency[^h1346] on the sky[^h7834].
###### 27
The eternal[^h6924] God[^h430] is thy refuge[^h4585], and underneath are the everlasting[^h5769] arms[^h2220]: and he shall thrust out[^h1644] the enemy[^h341] from before[^h6440] thee; and shall say[^h559], Destroy[^h8045] them.
###### 28
Israel[^h3478] then shall dwell[^h7931] in safety[^h983] alone[^h910]: the fountain[^h5869] of Jacob[^h3290] shall be upon a land[^h776] of corn[^h1715] and wine[^h8492]; also his heavens[^h8064] shall drop down[^h6201] dew[^h2919].
###### 29
Happy[^h835] art thou, O Israel[^h3478]: who is like unto thee, O people[^h5971] saved[^h3467] by the LORD[^h3068], the shield[^h4043] of thy help[^h5828], and who is the sword[^h2719] of thy excellency[^h1346]! and thine enemies[^h341] shall be found liars[^h3584] unto thee; and thou shalt tread[^h1869] upon their high places[^h1116].

###### 1
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] all Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto them, Hear[^h8085], O Israel[^h3478], the statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941] which I speak[^h1696] in your ears[^h241] this day[^h3117], that ye may learn[^h3925] them, and keep[^h8104], and do[^h6213] them. 
###### 2
The LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with us in Horeb[^h2722].
###### 3
The LORD[^h3068] made[^h3772] not this covenant[^h1285] with our fathers[^h1], but with us[^h587], even us, who are all of us[^h428] here alive[^h2416] this day[^h3117].
###### 4
The LORD[^h3068] talked[^h1696] with you face[^h6440] to face[^h6440] in the mount[^h2022] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784],
###### 5
(I stood[^h5975] between the LORD[^h3068] and you at that time[^h6256], to shew[^h5046] you the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]: for ye were afraid[^h3372] by reason[^h6440] of the fire[^h784], and went not up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022];) saying[^h559],
###### 6
I am the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], which brought thee out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from the house[^h1004] of bondage[^h5650]. 
###### 7
Thou shalt have none other[^h312] gods[^h430] before[^h6440] me.
###### 8
Thou shalt not make[^h6213] thee any graven image[^h6459], or any likeness[^h8544] of any thing that is in heaven[^h8064] above[^h4605], or that is in the earth[^h776] beneath, or that is in the waters[^h4325] beneath the earth[^h776]:
###### 9
Thou shalt not bow down[^h7812] thyself unto them, nor serve[^h5647] them: for I the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] am a jealous[^h7067] God[^h410], visiting[^h6485] the iniquity[^h5771] of the fathers[^h1] upon the children[^h1121] unto the third[^h8029] and fourth[^h7256] generation of them that hate[^h8130] me,
###### 10
And shewing[^h6213] mercy[^h2617] unto thousands[^h505] of them that love[^h157] me and keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687].
###### 11
Thou shalt not take[^h5375] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] in vain[^h7723]: for the LORD[^h3068] will not hold him guiltless[^h5352] that taketh[^h5375] his name[^h8034] in vain[^h7723].
###### 12
Keep[^h8104] the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117] to sanctify[^h6942] it, as the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath commanded[^h6680] thee.
###### 13
Six[^h8337] days[^h3117] thou shalt labour[^h5647], and do[^h6213] all thy work[^h4399]:
###### 14
But the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] is the sabbath[^h7676] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]: in it thou shalt not do[^h6213] any work[^h4399], thou, nor thy son[^h1121], nor thy daughter[^h1323], nor thy manservant[^h5650], nor thy maidservant[^h519], nor thine ox[^h7794], nor thine ass[^h2543], nor any of thy cattle[^h929], nor thy stranger[^h1616] that is within thy gates[^h8179]; that thy manservant[^h5650] and thy maidservant[^h519] may rest[^h5117] as well as thou.
###### 15
And remember[^h2142] that thou wast a servant[^h5650] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] brought[^h3318] thee out thence through a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027] and by a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220]: therefore the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] thee to keep[^h6213] the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117].
###### 16
Honour[^h3513] thy father[^h1] and thy mother[^h517], as the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath commanded[^h6680] thee; that thy days[^h3117] may be prolonged[^h748], and that it may go well[^h3190] with thee, in the land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee.
###### 17
Thou shalt not kill[^h7523].
###### 18
Neither shalt thou commit adultery[^h5003].
###### 19
Neither shalt thou steal[^h1589].
###### 20
Neither shalt thou bear[^h6030] false[^h7723] witness[^h5707] against thy neighbour[^h7453].
###### 21
Neither shalt thou desire[^h2530] thy neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802], neither shalt thou covet[^h183] thy neighbour's[^h7453] house[^h1004], his field[^h7704], or his manservant[^h5650], or his maidservant[^h519], his ox[^h7794], or his ass[^h2543], or any thing that is thy neighbour's[^h7453].
###### 22
These words[^h1697] the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto all your assembly[^h6951] in the mount[^h2022] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784], of the cloud[^h6051], and of the thick darkness[^h6205], with a great[^h1419] voice[^h6963]: and he added no more[^h3254]. And he wrote[^h3789] them in two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68], and delivered[^h5414] them unto me.
###### 23
And it came to pass, when ye heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] out of the midst[^h8432] of the darkness[^h2822], (for the mountain[^h2022] did burn[^h1197] with fire[^h784],) that ye came near[^h7126] unto me, even all the heads[^h7218] of your tribes[^h7626], and your elders[^h2205];
###### 24
And ye said[^h559], Behold, the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] hath shewed[^h7200] us his glory[^h3519] and his greatness[^h1433], and we have heard[^h8085] his voice[^h6963] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784]: we have seen[^h7200] this day[^h3117] that God[^h430] doth talk[^h1696] with man[^h120], and he liveth[^h2425].
###### 25
Now therefore why should we die[^h4191]? for this great[^h1419] fire[^h784] will consume[^h398] us: if we hear[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] any more[^h3254], then we shall die[^h4191]. 
###### 26
For who is there of all flesh[^h1320], that hath heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the living[^h2416] God[^h430] speaking[^h1696] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784], as we have, and lived[^h2421]?
###### 27
Go thou near[^h7126], and hear[^h8085] all that the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] shall say[^h559]: and speak[^h1696] thou unto us all that the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] shall speak[^h1696] unto thee; and we will hear[^h8085] it, and do[^h6213] it.
###### 28
And the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of your words[^h1697], when ye spake[^h1696] unto me; and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, I have heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the words[^h1697] of this people[^h5971], which they have spoken[^h1696] unto thee: they have well[^h3190] said all that they have spoken[^h1696].
###### 29
O that there were such[^h2088] an[^h4310] heart[^h3824] in them[^h5414], that they would fear[^h3372] me, and keep[^h8104] all my commandments[^h4687] always[^h3117], that it might be well[^h3190] with them, and with their children[^h1121] for ever[^h5769]!
###### 30
Go[^h3212] say[^h559] to them, Get[^h7725] you into your tents[^h168] again[^h7725].
###### 31
But as for thee, stand[^h5975] thou here by me[^h5978], and I will speak[^h1696] unto thee all the commandments[^h4687], and the statutes[^h2706], and the judgments[^h4941], which thou shalt teach[^h3925] them, that they may do[^h6213] them in the land[^h776] which I give[^h5414] them to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 32
Ye shall observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] therefore as the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath commanded[^h6680] you: ye shall not turn aside[^h5493] to the right hand[^h3225] or to the left[^h8040].
###### 33
Ye shall walk[^h3212] in all the ways[^h1870] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath commanded[^h6680] you, that ye may live[^h2421], and that it may be well[^h2895] with you, and that ye may prolong[^h748] your days[^h3117] in the land[^h776] which ye shall possess[^h3423].

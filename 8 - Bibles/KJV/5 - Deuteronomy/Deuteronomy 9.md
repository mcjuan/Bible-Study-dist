###### 1
Hear[^h8085], O Israel[^h3478]: Thou art to pass over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] this day[^h3117], to go in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] nations[^h1471] greater[^h1419] and mightier[^h6099] than thyself, cities[^h5892] great[^h1419] and fenced up[^h1219] to heaven[^h8064],
###### 2
A people[^h5971] great[^h1419] and tall[^h7311], the children[^h1121] of the Anakims[^h6062], whom thou knowest[^h3045], and of whom thou hast heard[^h8085] say, Who can stand[^h3320] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Anak[^h6061]!
###### 3
Understand[^h3045] therefore this day[^h3117], that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] is he which goeth over[^h5674] before[^h6440] thee; as a consuming[^h398] fire[^h784] he shall destroy[^h8045] them, and he shall bring them down[^h3665] before thy face[^h6440]: so shalt thou drive them out[^h3423], and destroy[^h6] them quickly[^h4118], as the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696] unto thee.
###### 4
Speak[^h559] not thou in thine heart[^h3824], after that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath cast them out[^h1920] from before[^h6440] thee, saying[^h559], For my righteousness[^h6666] the LORD[^h3068] hath brought me in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] this land[^h776]: but for the wickedness[^h7564] of these nations[^h1471] the LORD[^h3068] doth drive them out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] thee.
###### 5
Not for thy righteousness[^h6666], or for the uprightness[^h3476] of thine heart[^h3824], dost thou go[^h935] to possess[^h3423] their land[^h776]: but for the wickedness[^h7564] of these nations[^h1471] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] doth drive them out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] thee, and that he may perform[^h6965] the word[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto thy fathers[^h1], Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Jacob[^h3290].
###### 6
Understand[^h3045] therefore, that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee not this good[^h2896] land[^h776] to possess[^h3423] it for thy righteousness[^h6666]; for thou art a stiffnecked[^h6203] [^h7186] people[^h5971].
###### 7
Remember[^h2142], and forget[^h7911] not, how thou provokedst the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] to wrath[^h7107] in the wilderness[^h4057]: from[^h4480] the day[^h3117] that thou didst depart out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], until ye came[^h935] unto this place[^h4725], ye have been rebellious[^h4784] against[^h5973] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
Also in Horeb[^h2722] ye provoked[^h7107] the LORD[^h3068] to wrath[^h7107], so that the LORD[^h3068] was angry[^h599] with you to have destroyed[^h8045] you.
###### 9
When I was gone up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022] to receive[^h3947] the tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68], even the tables[^h3871] of the covenant[^h1285] which the LORD[^h3068] made[^h3772] with you, then I abode[^h3427] in the mount[^h2022] forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915], I neither did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325]:
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] unto me two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68] written[^h3789] with the finger[^h676] of God[^h430]; and on them was written according to all the words[^h1697], which the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] with you in the mount[^h2022] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784] in the day[^h3117] of the assembly[^h6951].
###### 11
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915], that the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] me the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68], even the tables[^h3871] of the covenant[^h1285].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Arise[^h6965], get thee down[^h3381] quickly[^h4118] from hence; for thy people[^h5971] which thou hast brought forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714] have corrupted[^h7843] themselves; they are quickly[^h4118] turned aside[^h5493] out of the way[^h1870] which I commanded[^h6680] them; they have made[^h6213] them a molten image[^h4541].
###### 13
Furthermore the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto me, saying[^h559], I have seen[^h7200] this people[^h5971], and, behold, it is a stiffnecked[^h6203] [^h7186] people[^h5971]:
###### 14
Let me alone[^h7503], that I may destroy[^h8045] them, and blot out[^h4229] their name[^h8034] from under heaven[^h8064]: and I will make[^h6213] of[^h854] thee a nation[^h1471] mightier[^h6099] and greater[^h7227] than they.
###### 15
So I turned[^h6437] and came down[^h3381] from the mount[^h2022], and the mount[^h2022] burned[^h1197] with fire[^h784]: and the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of the covenant[^h1285] were in my two[^h8147] hands[^h3027].
###### 16
And I looked[^h7200], and, behold, ye had sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and had made[^h6213] you a molten[^h4541] calf[^h5695]: ye had turned aside[^h5493] quickly[^h4118] out of the way[^h1870] which the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] you.
###### 17
And I took[^h8610] the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871], and cast[^h7993] them out of[^h5921] my two[^h8147] hands[^h3027], and brake[^h7665] them before your eyes[^h5869].
###### 18
And I fell down[^h5307] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], as at the first[^h7223], forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915]: I did neither eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325], because of all your sins[^h2403] which ye sinned[^h2398], in doing[^h6213] wickedly[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], to provoke him to anger[^h3707].
###### 19
For I was afraid[^h3025] of[^h6440] the anger[^h639] and hot displeasure[^h2534], wherewith the LORD[^h3068] was wroth[^h7107] against you to destroy[^h8045] you. But the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] unto me at that time[^h6471] also.
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] was very[^h3966] angry[^h599] with Aaron[^h175] to have destroyed[^h8045] him: and I prayed[^h6419] for Aaron[^h175] also the same time[^h6256].
###### 21
And I took[^h3947] your sin[^h2403], the calf[^h5695] which ye had made[^h6213], and burnt[^h8313] it with fire[^h784], and stamped[^h3807] it, and ground[^h2912] it very small[^h3190], even until it was as small[^h1854] as dust[^h6083]: and I cast[^h7993] the dust[^h6083] thereof into the brook[^h5158] that descended out[^h3381] of the mount[^h2022].
###### 22
And at Taberah[^h8404], and at Massah[^h4532], and at Kibrothhattaavah[^h6914], ye provoked the LORD[^h3068] to wrath[^h7107].
###### 23
Likewise when the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] you from Kadeshbarnea[^h6947], saying[^h559], Go up[^h5927] and possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which I have given[^h5414] you; then ye rebelled[^h4784] against the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and ye believed[^h539] him not, nor hearkened[^h8085] to his voice[^h6963].
###### 24
Ye have been rebellious[^h4784] against the LORD[^h3068] from the day[^h3117] that I knew[^h3045] you.
###### 25
Thus I fell down[^h5307] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915], as I fell down[^h5307] at the first; because the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h559] he would destroy[^h8045] you.
###### 26
I prayed[^h6419] therefore unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], destroy[^h7843] not thy people[^h5971] and thine inheritance[^h5159], which thou hast redeemed[^h6299] through thy greatness[^h1433], which thou hast brought forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714] with a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027].
###### 27
Remember[^h2142] thy servants[^h5650], Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Jacob[^h3290]; look[^h6437] not unto the stubbornness[^h7190] of this people[^h5971], nor to their wickedness[^h7562], nor to their sin[^h2403]:
###### 28
Lest the land[^h776] whence thou broughtest us out[^h3318] say[^h559], Because the LORD[^h3068] was not able[^h3201] to bring[^h935] them into the land[^h776] which he promised[^h1696] them, and because he hated[^h8135] them, he hath brought them out[^h3318] to slay[^h4191] them in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 29
Yet they are thy people[^h5971] and thine inheritance[^h5159], which thou broughtest out[^h3318] by thy mighty[^h1419] power[^h3581] and by thy stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220].

###### 1
When the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath cut off[^h3772] the nations[^h1471], whose land[^h776] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee, and thou succeedest[^h3423] them, and dwellest[^h3427] in their cities[^h5892], and in their houses[^h1004]; 
###### 2
Thou shalt separate[^h914] three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] for thee in the midst[^h8432] of thy land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 3
Thou shalt prepare[^h3559] thee a way[^h1870], and divide the coasts[^h1366] of thy land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth thee to inherit[^h5157], into three parts[^h8027], that every slayer[^h7523] may flee[^h5127] thither.
###### 4
And this is the case[^h1697] of the slayer[^h7523], which shall flee[^h5127] thither, that he may live[^h2425]: Whoso killeth[^h5221] his neighbour[^h7453] ignorantly[^h1097] [^h1847], whom he hated[^h8130] not in time[^h8543] past[^h8032]; 
###### 5
As when a man goeth[^h935] into the wood[^h3293] with his neighbour[^h7453] to hew[^h2404] wood[^h6086], and his hand[^h3027] fetcheth a stroke[^h5080] with the axe[^h1631] to cut down[^h3772] the tree[^h6086], and the head[^h1270] slippeth[^h5394] from the helve[^h6086], and lighteth[^h4672] upon his neighbour[^h7453], that he die[^h4191]; he shall flee[^h5127] unto one[^h259] of those cities[^h5892], and live[^h2425]:   
###### 6
Lest the avenger[^h1350] of the blood[^h1818] pursue[^h7291] the slayer[^h310] [^h7523], while[^h3588] his heart[^h3824] is hot[^h3179], and overtake[^h5381] him, because the way[^h1870] is long[^h7235], and slay[^h5221] him[^h5315]; whereas he was not worthy[^h4941] of death[^h4194], inasmuch as[^h3588] he hated[^h8130] him not in time[^h8543] past[^h8032].  
###### 7
Wherefore I command[^h6680] thee, saying[^h559], Thou shalt separate[^h914] three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] for thee.
###### 8
And if the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] enlarge[^h7337] thy coast[^h1366], as he hath sworn[^h7650] unto thy fathers[^h1], and give[^h5414] thee all the land[^h776] which he promised[^h1696] to give[^h5414] unto thy fathers[^h1];
###### 9
If thou shalt keep[^h8104] all these commandments[^h4687] to do[^h6213] them, which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117], to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and to walk[^h3212] ever[^h3117] in his ways[^h1870]; then shalt thou add[^h3254] three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] more for thee, beside these three[^h7969]:
###### 10
That innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] be not shed[^h8210] in[^h7130] thy land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159], and so blood[^h1818] be upon thee.
###### 11
But if any man[^h376] hate[^h8130] his neighbour[^h7453], and lie in wait[^h693] for him, and rise up[^h6965] against him, and smite[^h5221] him mortally[^h5315] that he die[^h4191], and fleeth[^h5127] into one[^h259] of these[^h411] cities[^h5892]: 
###### 12
Then the elders[^h2205] of his city[^h5892] shall send[^h7971] and fetch[^h3947] him thence, and deliver[^h5414] him into the hand[^h3027] of the avenger[^h1350] of blood[^h1818], that he may die[^h4191].
###### 13
Thine eye[^h5869] shall not pity[^h2347] him, but thou shalt put away[^h1197] the guilt of innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] from Israel[^h3478], that it may go well[^h2895] with thee.
###### 14
Thou shalt not remove[^h5253] thy neighbour's[^h7453] landmark[^h1366], which they of old time[^h7223] have set[^h1379] in thine inheritance[^h5159], which thou shalt inherit[^h5157] in the land[^h776] that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 15
One[^h259] witness[^h5707] shall not rise up[^h6965] against a man[^h376] for any iniquity[^h5771], or for any sin[^h2403], in any sin[^h2399] that he sinneth[^h2398]: at the mouth[^h6310] of two[^h8147] witnesses[^h5707], or at the mouth[^h6310] of three[^h7969] witnesses[^h5707], shall the matter[^h1697] be established[^h6965].
###### 16
If a false[^h2555] witness[^h5707] rise up[^h6965] against any man[^h376] to testify[^h6030] against him that which is wrong[^h5627]; 
###### 17
Then both[^h8147] the men[^h582], between whom the controversy[^h7379] is, shall stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], before[^h6440] the priests[^h3548] and the judges[^h8199], which shall be in those days[^h3117];
###### 18
And the judges[^h8199] shall make diligent[^h3190] inquisition[^h1875]: and, behold, if the witness[^h5707] be a false[^h8267] witness[^h5707], and hath testified[^h6030] falsely[^h8267] against his brother[^h251];
###### 19
Then shall ye do[^h6213] unto him, as he had thought[^h2161] to have done[^h6213] unto his brother[^h251]: so shalt thou put[^h1197] the evil[^h7451] away[^h1197] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 20
And those which remain[^h7604] shall hear[^h8085], and fear[^h3372], and shall henceforth[^h3254] commit[^h6213] no more any[^h1697] such evil[^h7451] among[^h7130] you.
###### 21
And thine eye[^h5869] shall not pity[^h2347]; but life[^h5315] shall go for life[^h5315], eye[^h5869] for eye[^h5869], tooth[^h8127] for tooth[^h8127], hand[^h3027] for hand[^h3027], foot[^h7272] for foot[^h7272].

###### 1
When a man[^h376] hath taken[^h3947] a wife[^h802], and married[^h1166] her, and it come to pass that she find[^h4672] no favour[^h2580] in his eyes[^h5869], because he hath found[^h4672] some[^h1697] uncleanness[^h6172] in her: then let him write[^h3789] her a bill[^h5612] of divorcement[^h3748], and give[^h5414] it in her hand[^h3027], and send[^h7971] her out of his house[^h1004].  
###### 2
And when she is departed out[^h3318] of his house[^h1004], she may go[^h1980] and be another[^h312] man's[^h376] wife.
###### 3
And if the latter[^h314] husband[^h376] hate[^h8130] her, and write[^h3789] her a bill[^h5612] of divorcement[^h3748], and giveth[^h5414] it in her hand[^h3027], and sendeth[^h7971] her out of his house[^h1004]; or if the latter[^h314] husband[^h376] die[^h4191], which took[^h3947] her to be his wife[^h802];
###### 4
Her former[^h7223] husband[^h1167], which sent her away[^h7971], may[^h3201] not take[^h3947] her again[^h7725] to be his wife[^h802], after[^h310] that she is defiled[^h2930]; for that is abomination[^h8441] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and thou shalt not cause the land[^h776] to sin[^h2398], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159].
###### 5
When a man[^h376] hath taken[^h3947] a new[^h2319] wife[^h802], he shall not go out[^h3318] to war[^h6635], neither shall he be charged[^h5674] with any business[^h1697]: but he shall be free[^h5355] at home[^h1004] one[^h259] year[^h8141], and shall cheer up[^h8055] his wife[^h802] which he hath taken[^h3947]. 
###### 6
No man shall take[^h2254] the nether[^h7347] or the upper millstone[^h7393] to pledge[^h2254]: for he taketh[^h2254] a man's life[^h5315] to pledge[^h2254].
###### 7
If a man[^h376] be found[^h4672] stealing[^h1589] any[^h5315] of his brethren[^h251] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and maketh merchandise[^h6014] of him, or selleth[^h4376] him; then that thief[^h1590] shall die[^h4191]; and thou shalt put[^h1197] evil[^h7451] away[^h1197] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 8
Take heed[^h8104] in the plague[^h5061] of leprosy[^h6883], that thou observe[^h8104] diligently[^h3966], and do[^h6213] according to all that the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881] shall teach[^h3384] you: as I commanded[^h6680] them, so ye shall observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213].
###### 9
Remember[^h2142] what the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] did[^h6213] unto Miriam[^h4813] by the way[^h1870], after that ye were come forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 10
When thou dost lend[^h5383] thy brother[^h7453] any[^h3972] thing[^h4859], thou shalt not go[^h935] into his house[^h1004] to fetch[^h5670] his pledge[^h5667]. 
###### 11
Thou shalt stand[^h5975] abroad[^h2351], and the man[^h376] to whom thou dost lend[^h5383] shall bring out[^h3318] the pledge[^h5667] abroad[^h2351] unto thee.
###### 12
And if the man[^h376] be poor[^h6041], thou shalt not sleep[^h7901] with his pledge[^h5667]:
###### 13
In any case[^h7725] thou shalt deliver[^h7725] him the pledge[^h5667] again[^h7725] when the sun[^h8121] goeth down[^h935], that he may sleep[^h7901] in his own raiment[^h8008], and bless[^h1288] thee: and it shall be righteousness[^h6666] unto thee before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430].
###### 14
Thou shalt not oppress[^h6231] an hired servant[^h7916] that is poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34], whether he be of thy brethren[^h251], or of thy strangers[^h1616] that are in thy land[^h776] within thy gates[^h8179]:
###### 15
At his day[^h3117] thou shalt give[^h5414] him his hire[^h7939], neither shall the sun[^h8121] go down[^h935] upon it; for he is poor[^h6041], and setteth[^h5375] his heart[^h5315] upon it: lest he cry[^h7121] against thee unto the LORD[^h3068], and it be sin[^h2399] unto thee. 
###### 16
The fathers[^h1] shall not be put to death[^h4191] for the children[^h1121], neither shall the children[^h1121] be put to death[^h4191] for the fathers[^h1]: every man[^h376] shall be put to death[^h4191] for his own sin[^h2399].
###### 17
Thou shalt not pervert[^h5186] the judgment[^h4941] of the stranger[^h1616], nor of the fatherless[^h3490]; nor take[^h2254] a widow's[^h490] raiment[^h899] to pledge[^h2254]:
###### 18
But thou shalt remember[^h2142] that thou wast a bondman[^h5650] in Egypt[^h4714], and the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] redeemed[^h6299] thee thence: therefore I command[^h6680] thee to do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 19
When thou cuttest down[^h7114] thine harvest[^h7105] in thy field[^h7704], and hast forgot[^h7911] a sheaf[^h6016] in the field[^h7704], thou shalt not go again[^h7725] to fetch[^h3947] it: it shall be for the stranger[^h1616], for the fatherless[^h3490], and for the widow[^h490]: that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] may bless[^h1288] thee in all the work[^h4639] of thine hands[^h3027].
###### 20
When thou beatest[^h2251] thine olive tree[^h2132], thou shalt not go over the boughs[^h6286] again[^h310]: it shall be for the stranger[^h1616], for the fatherless[^h3490], and for the widow[^h490]. 
###### 21
When thou gatherest[^h1219] the grapes of thy vineyard[^h3754], thou shalt not glean[^h5953] it afterward[^h310]: it shall be for the stranger[^h1616], for the fatherless[^h3490], and for the widow[^h490]. 
###### 22
And thou shalt remember[^h2142] that thou wast a bondman[^h5650] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: therefore I command[^h6680] thee to do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].

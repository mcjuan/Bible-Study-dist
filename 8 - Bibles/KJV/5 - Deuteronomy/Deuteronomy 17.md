###### 1
Thou shalt not sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] any bullock[^h7794], or sheep[^h7716], wherein is blemish[^h3971], or any evilfavouredness[^h7451] [^h1697]: for that is an abomination[^h8441] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]. 
###### 2
If there be found[^h4672] among[^h7130] you, within any[^h259] of thy gates[^h8179] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee, man[^h376] or woman[^h802], that hath wrought[^h6213] wickedness[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], in transgressing[^h5674] his covenant[^h1285],
###### 3
And hath gone[^h3212] and served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worshipped[^h7812] them, either the sun[^h8121], or moon[^h3394], or any of the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], which I have not commanded[^h6680];
###### 4
And it be told[^h5046] thee, and thou hast heard[^h8085] of it, and enquired[^h1875] diligently[^h3190], and, behold, it be true[^h571], and the thing[^h1697] certain[^h3559], that such abomination[^h8441] is wrought[^h6213] in Israel[^h3478]:
###### 5
Then shalt thou bring forth[^h3318] that man[^h376] or that woman[^h802], which have committed[^h6213] that wicked[^h7451] thing[^h1697], unto thy gates[^h8179], even that man[^h376] or that woman[^h802], and shalt stone[^h5619] them with stones[^h68], till they die[^h4191].
###### 6
At the mouth[^h6310] of two[^h8147] witnesses[^h5707], or three[^h7969] witnesses[^h5707], shall he that is worthy of death[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]; but at the mouth[^h6310] of one[^h259] witness[^h5707] he shall not be put to death[^h4191].
###### 7
The hands[^h3027] of the witnesses[^h5707] shall be first[^h7223] upon him to put him to death[^h4191], and afterward[^h314] the hands[^h3027] of all the people[^h5971]. So thou shalt put[^h1197] the evil[^h7451] away[^h1197] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 8
If there arise a matter[^h1697] too hard[^h6381] for thee in judgment[^h4941], between blood[^h1818] and blood[^h1818], between plea[^h1779] and plea[^h1779], and between stroke[^h5061] and stroke[^h5061], being matters[^h1697] of controversy[^h7379] within thy gates[^h8179]: then shalt thou arise[^h6965], and get thee up[^h5927] into the place[^h4725] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] shall choose[^h977];
###### 9
And thou shalt come[^h935] unto the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881], and unto the judge[^h8199] that shall be in those days[^h3117], and enquire[^h1875]; and they shall shew[^h5046] thee the sentence[^h1697] of judgment[^h4941]:
###### 10
And thou shalt do[^h6213] according to the sentence[^h6310] [^h1697], which they of that place[^h4725] which the LORD[^h3068] shall choose[^h977] shall shew[^h5046] thee; and thou shalt observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] according to all that they inform[^h3384] thee:
###### 11
According to the sentence[^h6310] of the law[^h8451] which they shall teach[^h3384] thee, and according to the judgment[^h4941] which they shall tell[^h559] thee, thou shalt do[^h6213]: thou shalt not decline[^h5493] from the sentence[^h1697] which they shall shew[^h5046] thee, to the right hand[^h3225], nor to the left[^h8040].
###### 12
And the man[^h376] that will do[^h6213] presumptuously[^h2087], and will not hearken[^h8085] unto the priest[^h3548] that standeth[^h5975] to minister[^h8334] there before the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], or unto the judge[^h8199], even that man[^h376] shall die[^h4191]: and thou shalt put away[^h1197] the evil[^h7451] from Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 13
And all the people[^h5971] shall hear[^h8085], and fear[^h3372], and do no more presumptuously[^h2102].
###### 14
When thou art come[^h935] unto the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee, and shalt possess[^h3423] it, and shalt dwell[^h3427] therein, and shalt say[^h559], I will set[^h7760] a king[^h4428] over me, like as all the nations[^h1471] that are about[^h5439] me;
###### 15
Thou shalt in any wise[^h7760] set[^h7760] him king[^h4428] over thee, whom the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] shall choose[^h977]: one from among[^h7130] thy brethren[^h251] shalt thou set[^h7760] king[^h4428] over thee: thou mayest[^h3201] not set[^h5414] a stranger[^h5237] [^h376] over thee, which is not thy brother[^h251].
###### 16
But he shall not multiply[^h7235] horses[^h5483] to himself, nor cause the people[^h5971] to return[^h7725] to Egypt[^h4714], to the end that he should multiply[^h7235] horses[^h5483]: forasmuch as the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h559] unto you, Ye shall henceforth[^h3254] return[^h7725] no more that way[^h1870].
###### 17
Neither shall he multiply[^h7235] wives[^h802] to himself, that his heart[^h3824] turn[^h5493] not away: neither shall he greatly[^h3966] multiply[^h7235] to himself silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091].
###### 18
And it shall be, when he sitteth[^h3427] upon the throne[^h3678] of his kingdom[^h4467], that he shall write[^h3789] him a copy[^h4932] of this law[^h8451] in a book[^h5612] out of that which is before[^h6440] the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881]:
###### 19
And it shall be with him, and he shall read[^h7121] therein all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416]: that he may learn[^h3925] to fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], to keep[^h8104] all the words[^h1697] of this law[^h8451] and these statutes[^h2706], to do[^h6213] them:
###### 20
That his heart[^h3824] be not lifted up[^h7311] above his brethren[^h251], and that he turn not aside[^h5493] from the commandment[^h4687], to the right hand[^h3225], or to the left[^h8040]: to the end that he may prolong[^h748] his days[^h3117] in his kingdom[^h4467], he, and his children[^h1121], in the midst[^h7130] of Israel[^h3478].

###### 1
Therefore thou shalt love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and keep[^h8104] his charge[^h4931], and his statutes[^h2708], and his judgments[^h4941], and his commandments[^h4687], alway[^h3117].
###### 2
And know[^h3045] ye this day[^h3117]: for I speak not with your children[^h1121] which have not known[^h3045], and which have not seen[^h7200] the chastisement[^h4148] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], his greatness[^h1433], his mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and his stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220],
###### 3
And his miracles[^h226], and his acts[^h4639], which he did[^h6213] in the midst[^h8432] of Egypt[^h4714] unto Pharaoh[^h6547] the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and unto all his land[^h776];
###### 4
And what he did[^h6213] unto the army[^h2428] of Egypt[^h4714], unto their horses[^h5483], and to their chariots[^h7393]; how he made the water[^h4325] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220] to overflow[^h6687] them[^h6440] as they pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] you, and how the LORD[^h3068] hath destroyed[^h6] them unto this day[^h3117];
###### 5
And what he did[^h6213] unto you in the wilderness[^h4057], until ye came[^h935] into this place[^h4725];
###### 6
And what he did[^h6213] unto Dathan[^h1885] and Abiram[^h48], the sons[^h1121] of Eliab[^h446], the son[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205]: how the earth[^h776] opened[^h6475] her mouth[^h6310], and swallowed them up[^h1104], and their households[^h1004], and their tents[^h168], and all the substance[^h3351] that was in their possession[^h7272], in the midst[^h7130] of all Israel[^h3478]:  
###### 7
But your eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200] all the great[^h1419] acts[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068] which he did[^h6213].
###### 8
Therefore shall ye keep[^h8104] all the commandments[^h4687] which[^h834] I command[^h6680] you this day[^h3117], that ye may be strong[^h2388], and go in[^h935] and possess[^h3423] the land[^h776], whither ye go[^h5674] to possess[^h3423] it;
###### 9
And that ye may prolong[^h748] your days[^h3117] in the land[^h127], which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto your fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] unto them and to their seed[^h2233], a land[^h776] that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706].
###### 10
For the land[^h776], whither thou goest in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it, is not as the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from whence ye came out[^h3318], where thou sowedst[^h2232] thy seed[^h2233], and wateredst[^h8248] it with thy foot[^h7272], as a garden[^h1588] of herbs[^h3419]:
###### 11
But the land[^h776], whither ye go[^h5674] to possess[^h3423] it, is a land[^h776] of hills[^h2022] and valleys[^h1237], and drinketh[^h8354] water[^h4325] of the rain[^h4306] of heaven[^h8064]:
###### 12
A land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] careth for[^h1875]: the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] are always[^h8548] upon it, from the beginning[^h7225] of the year[^h8141] even unto the end[^h319] of the year[^h8141]. 
###### 13
And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken[^h8085] diligently[^h8085] unto my commandments[^h4687] which I command[^h6680] you this day[^h3117], to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and to serve[^h5647] him with all your heart[^h3824] and with all your soul[^h5315],
###### 14
That I will give[^h5414] you the rain[^h4306] of your land[^h776] in his due season[^h6256], the first rain[^h3138] and the latter rain[^h4456], that thou mayest gather[^h622] in thy corn[^h1715], and thy wine[^h8492], and thine oil[^h3323].
###### 15
And I will send[^h5414] grass[^h6212] in thy fields[^h7704] for thy cattle[^h929], that thou mayest eat[^h398] and be full[^h7646]. 
###### 16
Take heed[^h8104] to yourselves, that your heart[^h3824] be not deceived[^h6601], and ye turn aside[^h5493], and serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worship[^h7812] them;
###### 17
And then the LORD'S[^h3068] wrath[^h639] be kindled[^h2734] against you, and he shut up[^h6113] the heaven[^h8064], that there be no rain[^h4306], and that the land[^h127] yield[^h5414] not her fruit[^h2981]; and lest ye perish[^h6] quickly[^h4120] from off the good[^h2896] land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] giveth[^h5414] you.
###### 18
Therefore shall ye lay up[^h7760] these my words[^h1697] in your heart[^h3824] and in your soul[^h5315], and bind[^h7194] them for a sign[^h226] upon your hand[^h3027], that they may be as frontlets[^h2903] between your eyes[^h5869].
###### 19
And ye shall teach[^h3925] them your children[^h1121], speaking[^h1696] of them when thou sittest[^h3427] in thine house[^h1004], and when thou walkest[^h3212] by the way[^h1870], when thou liest[^h7901] down, and when thou risest up[^h6965].
###### 20
And thou shalt write[^h3789] them upon the door posts[^h4201] of thine house[^h1004], and upon thy gates[^h8179]:
###### 21
That your days[^h3117] may be multiplied[^h7235], and the days[^h3117] of your children[^h1121], in the land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto your fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] them, as the days[^h3117] of heaven[^h8064] upon the earth[^h776].
###### 22
For if ye shall diligently[^h8104] keep[^h8104] all these commandments[^h4687] which I command[^h6680] you, to do[^h6213] them, to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in all his ways[^h1870], and to cleave[^h1692] unto him;
###### 23
Then will the LORD[^h3068] drive out[^h3423] all these nations[^h1471] from before[^h6440] you, and ye shall possess[^h3423] greater[^h1419] nations[^h1471] and mightier[^h6099] than yourselves.
###### 24
Every place[^h4725] whereon the soles[^h3709] of your feet[^h7272] shall tread[^h1869] shall be yours: from the wilderness[^h4057] and Lebanon[^h3844], from the river[^h5104], the river[^h5104] Euphrates[^h6578], even unto the uttermost[^h314] sea[^h3220] shall your coast[^h1366] be.
###### 25
There shall no man[^h376] be able to stand[^h3320] before[^h6440] you: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] shall lay[^h5414] the fear[^h6343] of you and the dread[^h4172] of you upon[^h6440] all the land[^h776] that ye shall tread[^h1869] upon, as he hath said[^h1696] unto you.
###### 26
Behold[^h7200], I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you this day[^h3117] a blessing[^h1293] and a curse[^h7045];
###### 27
A blessing[^h1293], if ye obey[^h8085] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which I command[^h6680] you this day[^h3117]:
###### 28
And a curse[^h7045], if ye will not obey[^h8085] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], but turn aside[^h5493] out of the way[^h1870] which I command[^h6680] you this day[^h3117], to go[^h3212] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430], which ye have not known[^h3045].
###### 29
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath brought thee in[^h935] unto the land[^h776] whither thou goest[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it, that thou shalt put[^h5414] the blessing[^h1293] upon mount[^h2022] Gerizim[^h1630], and the curse[^h7045] upon mount[^h2022] Ebal[^h5858].
###### 30
Are they not on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], by[^h310] the way[^h1870] where the sun[^h8121] goeth down[^h3996], in the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], which dwell[^h3427] in the champaign[^h6160] over against[^h4136] Gilgal[^h1537], beside[^h681] the plains[^h436] of Moreh[^h4176]?
###### 31
For ye shall pass over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to go in[^h935] to possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] you, and ye shall possess[^h3423] it, and dwell[^h3427] therein.
###### 32
And ye shall observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] all the statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941] which I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you this day[^h3117].

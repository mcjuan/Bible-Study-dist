###### 1
Give ear[^h238], O ye heavens[^h8064], and I will speak[^h1696]; and hear[^h8085], O earth[^h776], the words[^h561] of my mouth[^h6310].
###### 2
My doctrine[^h3948] shall drop[^h6201] as the rain[^h4306], my speech[^h565] shall distil[^h5140] as the dew[^h2919], as the small rain[^h8164] upon the tender herb[^h1877], and as the showers[^h7241] upon the grass[^h6212]:
###### 3
Because I will publish[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]: ascribe[^h3051] ye greatness[^h1433] unto our God[^h430].
###### 4
He is the Rock[^h6697], his work[^h6467] is perfect[^h8549]: for all his ways[^h1870] are judgment[^h4941]: a God[^h410] of truth[^h530] and without iniquity[^h5766], just[^h6662] and right[^h3477] is he.
###### 5
They have corrupted[^h7843] themselves, their spot[^h3971] is not the spot of his children[^h1121]: they are a perverse[^h6141] and crooked[^h6618] generation[^h1755].  
###### 6
Do ye thus requite[^h1580] the LORD[^h3068], O foolish[^h5036] people[^h5971] and unwise[^h2450]? is not he thy father[^h1] that hath bought[^h7069] thee? hath he not made[^h6213] thee, and established[^h3559] thee?
###### 7
Remember[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of old[^h5769], consider[^h995] the years[^h8141] of many[^h1755] generations[^h1755]: ask[^h7592] thy father[^h1], and he will shew[^h5046] thee; thy elders[^h2205], and they will tell[^h559] thee. 
###### 8
When the most High[^h5945] divided[^h5157] to the nations[^h1471] their inheritance[^h5157], when he separated[^h6504] the sons[^h1121] of Adam[^h120], he set[^h5324] the bounds[^h1367] of the people[^h5971] according to the number[^h4557] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 9
For the LORD'S[^h3068] portion[^h2506] is his people[^h5971]; Jacob[^h3290] is the lot[^h2256] of his inheritance[^h5159]. 
###### 10
He found[^h4672] him in a desert[^h4057] land[^h776], and in the waste[^h8414] howling[^h3214] wilderness[^h3452]; he led him about[^h5437], he instructed[^h995] him, he kept[^h5341] him as the apple[^h380] of his eye[^h5869]. 
###### 11
As an eagle[^h5404] stirreth up[^h5782] her nest[^h7064], fluttereth[^h7363] over her young[^h1469], spreadeth abroad[^h6566] her wings[^h3671], taketh[^h3947] them, beareth[^h5375] them on her wings[^h84]:
###### 12
So the LORD[^h3068] alone[^h910] did lead[^h5148] him, and there was no strange[^h5236] god[^h410] with him.
###### 13
He made him ride[^h7392] on the high places[^h1116] of the earth[^h776], that he might eat[^h398] the increase[^h8570] of the fields[^h7704]; and he made him to suck[^h3243] honey[^h1706] out of the rock[^h5553], and oil[^h8081] out of the flinty[^h2496] rock[^h6697];
###### 14
Butter[^h2529] of kine[^h1241], and milk[^h2461] of sheep[^h6629], with fat[^h2459] of lambs[^h3733], and rams[^h352] of the breed[^h1121] of Bashan[^h1316], and goats[^h6260], with the fat[^h2459] of kidneys[^h3629] of wheat[^h2406]; and thou didst drink[^h8354] the pure[^h2561] blood[^h1818] of the grape[^h6025].
###### 15
But Jeshurun[^h3484] waxed fat[^h8080], and kicked[^h1163]: thou art waxen fat[^h8080], thou art grown thick[^h5666], thou art covered[^h3780] with fatness; then he forsook[^h5203] God[^h433] which made[^h6213] him, and lightly esteemed[^h5034] the Rock[^h6697] of his salvation[^h3444].
###### 16
They provoked him to jealousy[^h7065] with strange[^h2114] gods, with abominations[^h8441] provoked they him to anger[^h3707].
###### 17
They sacrificed[^h2076] unto devils[^h7700], not to God[^h433]; to gods[^h430] whom they knew[^h3045] not, to new[^h2319] gods that came[^h935] newly[^h7138] up[^h935], whom your fathers[^h1] feared[^h8175] not. 
###### 18
Of the Rock[^h6697] that begat[^h3205] thee thou art unmindful[^h7876], and hast forgotten[^h7911] God[^h410] that formed[^h2342] thee.
###### 19
And when the LORD[^h3068] saw[^h7200] it, he abhorred[^h5006] them, because of the provoking[^h3708] of his sons[^h1121], and of his daughters[^h1323]. 
###### 20
And he said[^h559], I will hide[^h5641] my face[^h6440] from them, I will see[^h7200] what their end[^h319] shall be: for they are a very froward[^h8419] generation[^h1755], children[^h1121] in whom is no faith[^h529].
###### 21
They have moved me to jealousy[^h7065] with that which is not[^h3808] God[^h410]; they have provoked me to anger[^h3707] with their vanities[^h1892]: and I will move them to jealousy[^h7065] with those which are not a people[^h5971]; I will provoke them to anger[^h3707] with a foolish[^h5036] nation[^h1471].
###### 22
For a fire[^h784] is kindled[^h6919] in mine anger[^h639], and shall burn[^h3344] unto the lowest[^h8482] hell[^h7585], and shall consume[^h398] the earth[^h776] with her increase[^h2981], and set on fire[^h3857] the foundations[^h4144] of the mountains[^h2022].  
###### 23
I will heap[^h5595] mischiefs[^h7451] upon them; I will spend[^h3615] mine arrows[^h2671] upon them.
###### 24
They shall be burnt[^h4198] with hunger[^h7458], and devoured[^h3898] with burning heat[^h7565], and with bitter[^h4815] destruction[^h6986]: I will also send[^h7971] the teeth[^h8127] of beasts[^h929] upon them, with the poison[^h2534] of serpents[^h2119] of the dust[^h6083]. 
###### 25
The sword[^h2719] without[^h2351], and terror[^h367] within[^h2315], shall destroy[^h7921] both the young man[^h970] and the virgin[^h1330], the suckling[^h3243] also with the man[^h376] of gray hairs[^h7872].  
###### 26
I said[^h559], I would scatter them into corners[^h6284], I would make the remembrance[^h2143] of them to cease[^h7673] from among men[^h582]:
###### 27
Were it not[^h3884] that I feared[^h1481] the wrath[^h3708] of the enemy[^h341], lest their adversaries[^h6862] should behave themselves strangely[^h5234], and lest they should say[^h559], Our hand[^h3027] is high[^h7311], and the LORD[^h3068] hath not done[^h6466] all this. 
###### 28
For they are a nation[^h1471] void[^h6] of counsel[^h6098], neither is there any understanding[^h8394] in them.
###### 29
O that[^h3863] they were wise[^h2449], that they understood[^h7919] this, that they would consider[^h995] their latter end[^h319]!
###### 30
How should one[^h259] chase[^h7291] a thousand[^h505], and two[^h8147] put ten[^h7233] thousand[^h505] to flight[^h5127], except[^h3808] their Rock[^h6697] had sold[^h4376] them[^h3588], and the LORD[^h3068] had shut them up[^h5462]?
###### 31
For their rock[^h6697] is not as our Rock[^h6697], even our enemies[^h341] themselves being judges[^h6414].
###### 32
For their vine[^h1612] is of the vine[^h1612] of Sodom[^h5467], and of the fields[^h7709] of Gomorrah[^h6017]: their grapes[^h6025] are grapes[^h6025] of gall[^h7219], their clusters[^h811] are bitter[^h4846]: 
###### 33
Their wine[^h3196] is the poison[^h2534] of dragons[^h8577], and the cruel[^h393] venom[^h7219] of asps[^h6620].
###### 34
Is not this laid up in store[^h3647] with me, and sealed up[^h2856] among my treasures[^h214]?
###### 35
To me belongeth vengeance[^h5359], and recompence[^h8005]; their foot[^h7272] shall slide[^h4131] in due time[^h6256]: for the day[^h3117] of their calamity[^h343] is at hand[^h7138], and the things that shall come[^h6264] upon them make haste[^h2363].
###### 36
For the LORD[^h3068] shall judge[^h1777] his people[^h5971], and repent[^h5162] himself for his servants[^h5650], when he seeth[^h7200] that their power[^h3027] is gone[^h235], and there is none[^h657] shut up[^h6113], or left[^h5800]. 
###### 37
And he shall say[^h559], Where are their gods[^h430], their rock[^h6697] in whom they trusted[^h2620],
###### 38
Which did eat[^h398] the fat[^h2459] of their sacrifices[^h2077], and drank[^h8354] the wine[^h3196] of their drink offerings[^h5257]? let them rise up[^h6965] and help[^h5826] you, and be your protection[^h5643]. 
###### 39
See[^h7200] now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god[^h430] with me: I kill[^h4191], and I make alive[^h2421]; I wound[^h4272], and I heal[^h7495]: neither is there any that can deliver[^h5337] out of my hand[^h3027].
###### 40
For I lift up[^h5375] my hand[^h3027] to heaven[^h8064], and say[^h559], I live[^h2416] for ever[^h5769].
###### 41
If I whet[^h8150] my glittering[^h1300] sword[^h2719], and mine hand[^h3027] take hold[^h270] on judgment[^h4941]; I will render[^h7725] vengeance[^h5359] to mine enemies[^h6862], and will reward[^h7999] them that hate[^h8130] me.
###### 42
I will make mine arrows[^h2671] drunk[^h7937] with blood[^h1818], and my sword[^h2719] shall devour[^h398] flesh[^h1320]; and that with the blood[^h1818] of the slain[^h2491] and of the captives[^h7633], from the beginning[^h7218] of revenges[^h6546] upon the enemy[^h341].
###### 43
Rejoice[^h7442], O ye nations[^h1471], with his people[^h5971]: for he will avenge[^h5358] the blood[^h1818] of his servants[^h5650], and will render[^h7725] vengeance[^h5359] to his adversaries[^h6862], and will be merciful[^h3722] unto his land[^h127], and to his people[^h5971]. 
###### 44
And Moses[^h4872] came[^h935] and spake[^h1696] all the words[^h1697] of this song[^h7892] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971], he, and Hoshea[^h1954] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126]. 
###### 45
And Moses[^h4872] made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] all these words[^h1697] to all Israel[^h3478]:
###### 46
And he said[^h559] unto them, Set[^h7760] your hearts[^h3824] unto all the words[^h1697] which I testify[^h5749] among you this day[^h3117], which ye shall command[^h6680] your children[^h1121] to observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213], all the words[^h1697] of this law[^h8451].
###### 47
For it is not a vain[^h7386] thing[^h1697] for you; because it is your life[^h2416]: and through this thing[^h1697] ye shall prolong[^h748] your days[^h3117] in the land[^h127], whither ye go over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 48
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] that selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117], saying[^h559],
###### 49
Get thee up[^h5927] into this mountain[^h2022] Abarim[^h5682], unto mount[^h2022] Nebo[^h5015], which is in the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], that is over against[^h6440] Jericho[^h3405]; and behold[^h7200] the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], which I give[^h5414] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] for a possession[^h272]:
###### 50
And die[^h4191] in the mount[^h2022] whither thou goest up[^h5927], and be gathered[^h622] unto thy people[^h5971]; as Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251] died[^h4191] in mount[^h2022] Hor[^h2023], and was gathered[^h622] unto his people[^h5971]:
###### 51
Because ye trespassed[^h4603] against me among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] at the waters[^h4325] of Meribah-Kadesh[^h4808] [^h6946], in the wilderness[^h4057] of Zin[^h6790]; because ye sanctified[^h6942] me not in the midst[^h8432] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 52
Yet thou shalt see[^h7200] the land[^h776] before thee; but thou shalt not go[^h935] thither unto the land[^h776] which I give[^h5414] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].

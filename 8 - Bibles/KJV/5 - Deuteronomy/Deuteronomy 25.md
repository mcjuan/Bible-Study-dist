###### 1
If there be a controversy[^h7379] between men[^h582], and they come[^h5066] unto judgment[^h4941], that the judges may judge[^h8199] them; then they shall justify[^h6663] the righteous[^h6662], and condemn[^h7561] the wicked[^h7563].
###### 2
And it shall be, if the wicked man[^h7563] be worthy[^h1121] to be beaten[^h5221], that the judge[^h8199] shall cause him to lie down[^h5307], and to be beaten[^h5221] before his face[^h6440], according[^h1767] to his fault[^h7564], by a certain number[^h4557].
###### 3
Forty[^h705] stripes[^h5221] he may give him, and not exceed[^h3254]: lest, if he should exceed[^h3254], and beat[^h5221] him above these with many[^h7227] stripes[^h4347], then thy brother[^h251] should seem vile[^h7034] [^h5869] unto thee.
###### 4
Thou shalt not muzzle[^h2629] the ox[^h7794] when he treadeth out[^h1778] the corn. 
###### 5
If brethren[^h251] dwell[^h3427] together[^h3162], and one[^h259] of them die[^h4191], and have no child[^h1121], the wife[^h802] of the dead[^h4191] shall not marry without[^h2351] unto a stranger[^h376] [^h2114]: her husband's brother[^h2993] shall go in[^h935] unto her, and take[^h3947] her to him to wife[^h802], and perform the duty of an husband's brother[^h2992] unto her. 
###### 6
And it shall be, that the firstborn[^h1060] which she beareth[^h3205] shall succeed[^h6965] in the name[^h8034] of his brother[^h251] which is dead[^h4191], that his name[^h8034] be not put out[^h4229] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And if the man[^h376] like[^h2654] not to take[^h3947] his brother's wife[^h2994], then let his brother's wife[^h2994] go up[^h5927] to the gate[^h8179] unto the elders[^h2205], and say[^h559], My husband's brother[^h2993] refuseth[^h3985] to raise up[^h6965] unto his brother[^h251] a name[^h8034] in Israel[^h3478], he will[^h14] not perform the duty of my husband's brother[^h2992]. 
###### 8
Then the elders[^h2205] of his city[^h5892] shall call[^h7121] him, and speak[^h1696] unto him: and if he stand[^h5975] to it, and say[^h559], I like[^h2654] not to take[^h3947] her;
###### 9
Then shall his brother's wife[^h2994] come[^h5066] unto him in the presence[^h5869] of the elders[^h2205], and loose[^h2502] his shoe[^h5275] from off his foot[^h7272], and spit[^h3417] in his face[^h6440], and shall answer[^h6030] and say[^h559], So shall it be done[^h6213] unto that man[^h376] that will not build up[^h1129] his brother's[^h251] house[^h1004].
###### 10
And his name[^h8034] shall be called[^h7121] in Israel[^h3478], The house[^h1004] of him that hath his shoe[^h5275] loosed[^h2502].
###### 11
When men[^h582] strive[^h5327] together[^h3162] one with another[^h251] [^h376], and the wife[^h802] of the one[^h259] draweth near[^h7126] for to deliver[^h5337] her husband[^h376] out of the hand[^h3027] of him that smiteth[^h5221] him, and putteth forth[^h7971] her hand[^h3027], and taketh[^h2388] him by the secrets[^h4016]:
###### 12
Then thou shalt cut off[^h7112] her hand[^h3709], thine eye[^h5869] shall not pity[^h2347] her.
###### 13
Thou shalt not have in thy bag[^h3599] divers weights[^h68] [^h68], a great[^h1419] and a small[^h6996]. 
###### 14
Thou shalt not have in thine house[^h1004] divers measures[^h374] [^h374], a great[^h1419] and a small[^h6996]. 
###### 15
But thou shalt have a perfect[^h8003] and just[^h6664] weight[^h68], a perfect[^h8003] and just[^h6664] measure[^h374] shalt thou have: that thy days[^h3117] may be lengthened[^h748] in the land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee.
###### 16
For all that do[^h6213] such things[^h428], and all that do[^h6213] unrighteously[^h5766], are an abomination[^h8441] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430].
###### 17
Remember[^h2142] what Amalek[^h6002] did[^h6213] unto thee by the way[^h1870], when ye were come forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714];
###### 18
How he met[^h7136] thee by the way[^h1870], and smote the hindmost[^h2179] of thee, even all that were feeble[^h2826] behind[^h310] thee, when thou wast faint[^h5889] and weary[^h3023]; and he feared[^h3373] not God[^h430].
###### 19
Therefore it shall be, when the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath given thee rest[^h5117] from all thine enemies[^h341] round about[^h5439], in the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159] to possess[^h3423] it, that thou shalt blot out[^h4229] the remembrance[^h2143] of Amalek[^h6002] from under heaven[^h8064]; thou shalt not forget[^h7911] it.

###### 1
Then we turned[^h6437], and took our journey[^h5265] into the wilderness[^h4057] by the way[^h1870] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], as the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto me: and we compassed[^h5437] mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165] many[^h7227] days[^h3117].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 3
Ye have compassed[^h5437] this mountain[^h2022] long enough[^h7227]: turn[^h6437] you northward[^h6828].
###### 4
And command[^h6680] thou the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Ye are to pass[^h5674] through the coast[^h1366] of your brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Esau[^h6215], which dwell[^h3427] in Seir[^h8165]; and they shall be afraid[^h3372] of you: take ye good[^h3966] heed[^h8104] unto yourselves therefore:
###### 5
Meddle[^h1624] not with them; for I will not give[^h5414] you of their land[^h776], no, not so much as a foot[^h7272] breadth[^h4096] [^h3709]; because I have given[^h5414] mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165] unto Esau[^h6215] for a possession[^h3425]. 
###### 6
Ye shall buy[^h7666] meat[^h400] of them for money[^h3701], that ye may eat[^h398]; and ye shall also buy[^h3739] water[^h4325] of them for money[^h3701], that ye may drink[^h8354].
###### 7
For the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath blessed[^h1288] thee in all the works[^h4639] of thy hand[^h3027]: he knoweth[^h3045] thy walking[^h3212] through this great[^h1419] wilderness[^h4057]: these forty[^h705] years[^h8141] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath been with thee; thou hast lacked[^h2637] nothing[^h1697].
###### 8
And when we passed[^h5674] by from our brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Esau[^h6215], which dwelt[^h3427] in Seir[^h8165], through the way[^h1870] of the plain[^h6160] from Elath[^h359], and from Eziongaber[^h6100], we turned[^h6437] and passed[^h5674] by the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Distress[^h6696] not the Moabites[^h4124], neither contend[^h1624] with them in battle[^h4421]: for I will not give[^h5414] thee of their land[^h776] for a possession[^h3425]; because I have given[^h5414] Ar[^h6144] unto the children[^h1121] of Lot[^h3876] for a possession[^h3425]. 
###### 10
The Emims[^h368] dwelt[^h3427] therein in times past[^h6440], a people[^h5971] great[^h1419], and many[^h7227], and tall[^h7311], as the Anakims[^h6062];
###### 11
Which[^h1992] also were accounted[^h2803] giants[^h7497], as the Anakims[^h6062]; but the Moabites[^h4125] call[^h7121] them Emims[^h368].
###### 12
The Horims[^h2752] also dwelt[^h3427] in Seir[^h8165] beforetime[^h6440]; but the children[^h1121] of Esau[^h6215] succeeded[^h3423] them, when they had destroyed[^h8045] them from before[^h6440] them, and dwelt[^h3427] in their stead; as Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] unto the land[^h776] of his possession[^h3425], which the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] unto them.  
###### 13
Now rise up[^h6965], said I, and get you over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Zered[^h2218]. And we went over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Zered[^h2218]. 
###### 14
And the space[^h3117] in which we came[^h1980] from Kadeshbarnea[^h6947], until we were come over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Zered[^h2218], was thirty[^h7970] and eight[^h8083] years[^h8141]; until all the generation[^h1755] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] were wasted out[^h8552] from among[^h7130] the host[^h4264], as the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto them. 
###### 15
For indeed the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was against them, to destroy[^h2000] them from among[^h7130] the host[^h4264], until they were consumed[^h8552].
###### 16
So it came to pass, when all the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] were consumed[^h8552] and dead[^h4191] from among[^h7130] the people[^h5971],
###### 17
That the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 18
Thou art to pass over[^h5674] through Ar[^h6144], the coast[^h1366] of Moab[^h4124], this day[^h3117]:
###### 19
And when thou comest nigh[^h7126] over against[^h4136] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], distress[^h6696] them not, nor meddle[^h1624] with them: for I will not give[^h5414] thee of the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] any possession[^h3425]; because I have given[^h5414] it unto the children[^h1121] of Lot[^h3876] for a possession[^h3425].
###### 20
(That also was accounted[^h2803] a land[^h776] of giants[^h7497]: giants[^h7497] dwelt[^h3427] therein in old time[^h6440]; and the Ammonites[^h5984] call[^h7121] them Zamzummims[^h2157];
###### 21
A people[^h5971] great[^h1419], and many[^h7227], and tall[^h7311], as the Anakims[^h6062]; but the LORD[^h3068] destroyed[^h8045] them before[^h6440] them; and they succeeded[^h3423] them, and dwelt[^h3427] in their stead:
###### 22
As he did[^h6213] to the children[^h1121] of Esau[^h6215], which dwelt[^h3427] in Seir[^h8165], when he destroyed[^h8045] the Horims[^h2752] from before[^h6440] them; and they succeeded[^h3423] them, and dwelt[^h3427] in their stead even unto this day[^h3117]:
###### 23
And the Avims[^h5761] which dwelt[^h3427] in Hazerim[^h2699], even unto Azzah[^h5804], the Caphtorims[^h3732], which came forth[^h3318] out of Caphtor[^h3731], destroyed[^h8045] them, and dwelt[^h3427] in their stead.)
###### 24
Rise ye up[^h6965], take your journey[^h5265], and pass over[^h5674] the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769]: behold[^h7200], I have given[^h5414] into thine hand[^h3027] Sihon[^h5511] the Amorite[^h567], king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], and his land[^h776]: begin[^h2490] to possess[^h3423] it, and contend[^h1624] with him in battle[^h4421]. 
###### 25
This day[^h3117] will I begin[^h2490] to put[^h5414] the dread[^h6343] of thee and the fear[^h3374] of thee upon the nations[^h6440] [^h5971] that are under the whole heaven[^h8064], who shall hear[^h8085] report[^h8088] of thee, and shall tremble[^h7264], and be in anguish[^h2342] because of thee[^h6440].
###### 26
And I sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] out of the wilderness[^h4057] of Kedemoth[^h6932] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809] with words[^h1697] of peace[^h7965], saying[^h559],
###### 27
Let me pass[^h5674] through thy land[^h776]: I will go[^h3212] along by the high way[^h1870] [^h1870], I will neither turn[^h5493] unto the right hand[^h3225] nor to the left[^h8040].
###### 28
Thou shalt sell[^h7666] me meat[^h400] for money[^h3701], that I may eat[^h398]; and give[^h5414] me water[^h4325] for money[^h3701], that I may drink[^h8354]: only I will pass through[^h5674] on my feet[^h7272];
###### 29
(As the children[^h1121] of Esau[^h6215] which dwell[^h3427] in Seir[^h8165], and the Moabites[^h4125] which dwell[^h3427] in Ar[^h6144], did[^h6213] unto me;) until I shall pass over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] into the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] us.
###### 30
But Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809] would[^h14] not let us pass[^h5674] by him: for the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hardened[^h7185] his spirit[^h7307], and made his heart[^h3824] obstinate[^h553], that he might deliver[^h5414] him into thy hand[^h3027], as appeareth this day[^h3117].
###### 31
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Behold[^h7200], I have begun[^h2490] to give[^h5414] Sihon[^h5511] and his land[^h776] before[^h6440] thee: begin[^h2490] to possess[^h3423], that thou mayest inherit[^h3423] his land[^h776].
###### 32
Then Sihon[^h5511] came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] us, he and all his people[^h5971], to fight[^h4421] at Jahaz[^h3096].
###### 33
And the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] him before[^h6440] us; and we smote[^h5221] him, and his sons[^h1121], and all his people[^h5971].
###### 34
And we took[^h3920] all his cities[^h5892] at that time[^h6256], and utterly destroyed[^h2763] the men[^h4962], and the women[^h802], and the little ones[^h2945], of every city[^h5892], we left[^h7604] none to remain[^h8300]: 
###### 35
Only the cattle[^h929] we took for a prey[^h962] unto ourselves, and the spoil[^h7998] of the cities[^h5892] which we took[^h3920].
###### 36
From Aroer[^h6177], which is by the brink[^h8193] of the river[^h5158] of Arnon[^h769], and from the city[^h5892] that is by the river[^h5158], even unto Gilead[^h1568], there was not one city[^h7151] too strong[^h7682] for us: the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] all unto us[^h6440]:
###### 37
Only unto the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] thou camest[^h7126] not, nor unto any place[^h3027] of the river[^h5158] Jabbok[^h2999], nor unto the cities[^h5892] in the mountains[^h2022], nor unto whatsoever the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] forbad[^h6680] us.

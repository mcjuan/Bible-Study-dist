###### 1
Thou shalt not see[^h7200] thy brother's[^h251] ox[^h7794] or his sheep[^h7716] go astray[^h5080], and hide[^h5956] thyself from them: thou shalt in any case[^h7725] bring them again[^h7725] unto thy brother[^h251].
###### 2
And if thy brother[^h251] be not nigh[^h7138] unto thee, or if thou know[^h3045] him not, then thou shalt bring[^h622] it unto[^h8432] thine own house[^h1004], and it shall be with thee until thy brother[^h251] seek[^h1875] after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again[^h7725].
###### 3
In like manner[^h3651] shalt thou do[^h6213] with his ass[^h2543]; and so shalt thou do[^h6213] with his raiment[^h8071]; and with all lost thing[^h9] of thy brother's[^h251], which he hath lost[^h6], and thou hast found[^h4672], shalt thou do[^h6213] likewise: thou mayest[^h3201] not hide[^h5956] thyself.
###### 4
Thou shalt not see[^h7200] thy brother's[^h251] ass[^h2543] or his ox[^h7794] fall down[^h5307] by the way[^h1870], and hide[^h5956] thyself from them: thou shalt surely[^h6965] help him to lift them up again[^h6965].
###### 5
The woman[^h802] shall not wear that which pertaineth[^h3627] unto a man[^h1397], neither shall a man[^h1397] put[^h3847] on a woman's[^h802] garment[^h8071]: for all that do[^h6213] so[^h428] are abomination[^h8441] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430].
###### 6
If a bird's[^h6833] nest[^h7064] chance[^h7122] to be before[^h6440] thee in the way[^h1870] in any tree[^h6086], or on the ground[^h776], whether they be young ones[^h667], or eggs[^h1000], and the dam[^h517] sitting[^h7257] upon the young[^h667], or upon the eggs[^h1000], thou shalt not take[^h3947] the dam[^h517] with the young[^h1121]:
###### 7
But thou shalt in any wise[^h7971] let the dam[^h517] go[^h7971], and take[^h3947] the young[^h1121] to thee; that it may be well[^h3190] with thee, and that thou mayest prolong[^h748] thy days[^h3117].
###### 8
When thou buildest[^h1129] a new[^h2319] house[^h1004], then thou shalt make[^h6213] a battlement[^h4624] for thy roof[^h1406], that thou bring[^h7760] not blood[^h1818] upon thine house[^h1004], if any man[^h5307] fall[^h5307] from thence.
###### 9
Thou shalt not sow[^h2232] thy vineyard[^h3754] with divers seeds[^h3610]: lest the fruit[^h4395] of thy seed[^h2233] which thou hast sown[^h2232], and the fruit[^h8393] of thy vineyard[^h3754], be defiled[^h6942]. 
###### 10
Thou shalt not plow[^h2790] with an ox[^h7794] and an ass[^h2543] together[^h3162].
###### 11
Thou shalt not wear[^h3847] a garment of divers sorts[^h8162], as of woollen[^h6785] and linen[^h6593] together[^h3162].
###### 12
Thou shalt make[^h6213] thee fringes[^h1434] upon the four[^h702] quarters[^h3671] of thy vesture[^h3682], wherewith thou coverest[^h3680] thyself. 
###### 13
If any man[^h376] take[^h3947] a wife[^h802], and go in[^h935] unto her, and hate[^h8130] her,
###### 14
And give[^h7760] occasions[^h5949] of speech[^h1697] against her, and bring up[^h3318] an evil[^h7451] name[^h8034] upon her, and say[^h559], I took[^h3947] this woman[^h802], and when I came[^h7126] to her, I found[^h4672] her not a maid[^h1331]:
###### 15
Then shall the father[^h1] of the damsel[^h5291], and her mother[^h517], take[^h3947] and bring forth[^h3318] the tokens of the damsel's[^h5291] virginity[^h1331] unto the elders[^h2205] of the city[^h5892] in the gate[^h8179]:
###### 16
And the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1] shall say[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205], I gave[^h5414] my daughter[^h1323] unto this man[^h376] to wife[^h802], and he hateth[^h8130] her;
###### 17
And, lo, he hath given[^h7760] occasions[^h5949] of speech[^h1697] against her, saying[^h559], I found[^h4672] not thy daughter[^h1323] a maid[^h1331]; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's[^h1323] virginity[^h1331]. And they shall spread[^h6566] the cloth[^h8071] before[^h6440] the elders[^h2205] of the city[^h5892].
###### 18
And the elders[^h2205] of that city[^h5892] shall take[^h3947] that man[^h376] and chastise[^h3256] him;
###### 19
And they shall amerce[^h6064] him in an hundred[^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701], and give[^h5414] them unto the father[^h1] of the damsel[^h5291], because he hath brought up[^h3318] an evil[^h7451] name[^h8034] upon a virgin[^h1330] of Israel[^h3478]: and she shall be his wife[^h802]; he may[^h3201] not put her away[^h7971] all his days[^h3117].
###### 20
But if this thing[^h1697] be true[^h571], and the tokens of virginity[^h1331] be not found[^h4672] for the damsel[^h5291]:
###### 21
Then they shall bring out[^h3318] the damsel[^h5291] to the door[^h6607] of her father's[^h1] house[^h1004], and the men[^h582] of her city[^h5892] shall stone[^h5619] her with stones[^h68] that she die[^h4191]: because she hath wrought[^h6213] folly[^h5039] in Israel[^h3478], to play the whore[^h2181] in her father's[^h1] house[^h1004]: so shalt thou put[^h1197] evil[^h7451] away[^h1197] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 22
If a man[^h376] be found[^h4672] lying[^h7901] with a woman[^h802] married[^h1166] to an husband[^h1167], then they shall both of them[^h8147] die[^h4191], both the man[^h376] that lay[^h7901] with the woman[^h802], and the woman[^h802]: so shalt thou put away[^h1197] evil[^h7451] from Israel[^h3478].
###### 23
If a damsel[^h5291] that is a virgin[^h1330] be betrothed[^h781] unto an husband[^h376], and a man[^h376] find[^h4672] her in the city[^h5892], and lie[^h7901] with her;
###### 24
Then ye shall bring[^h3318] them both[^h8147] out unto the gate[^h8179] of that city[^h5892], and ye shall stone[^h5619] them with stones[^h68] that they die[^h4191]; the damsel[^h5291], because[^h834] [^h1697] she cried[^h6817] not, being in the city[^h5892]; and the man[^h376], because[^h834] [^h1697] he hath humbled[^h6031] his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802]: so thou shalt put away[^h1197] evil[^h7451] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 25
But if a man[^h376] find[^h4672] a betrothed[^h781] damsel[^h5291] in the field[^h7704], and the man[^h376] force[^h2388] her, and lie[^h7901] with her: then the man[^h376] only that lay[^h7901] with her shall die[^h4191]: 
###### 26
But unto the damsel[^h5291] thou shalt do[^h6213] nothing[^h1697]; there is in the damsel[^h5291] no sin[^h2399] worthy of death[^h4194]: for as when a man[^h376] riseth[^h6965] against his neighbour[^h7453], and slayeth[^h7523] [^h5315] him, even so is this matter[^h1697]:
###### 27
For he found[^h4672] her in the field[^h7704], and the betrothed[^h781] damsel[^h5291] cried[^h6817], and there was none to save[^h3467] her.
###### 28
If a man[^h376] find[^h4672] a damsel[^h5291] that is a virgin[^h1330], which is not betrothed[^h781], and lay hold[^h8610] on her, and lie[^h7901] with her, and they be found[^h4672];
###### 29
Then the man[^h376] that lay[^h7901] with her shall give[^h5414] unto the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1] fifty[^h2572] shekels of silver[^h3701], and she shall be his wife[^h802]; because he hath humbled[^h6031] her, he may[^h3201] not put her away[^h7971] all his days[^h3117].
###### 30
A man[^h376] shall not take[^h3947] his father's[^h1] wife[^h802], nor discover[^h1540] his father's[^h1] skirt[^h3671].

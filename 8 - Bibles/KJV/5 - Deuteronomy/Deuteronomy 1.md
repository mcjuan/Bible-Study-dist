###### 1
These be the words[^h1697] which Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto all Israel[^h3478] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] in the wilderness[^h4057], in the plain[^h6160] over against[^h4136] the Red[^h5489] sea, between Paran[^h6290], and Tophel[^h8603], and Laban[^h3837], and Hazeroth[^h2698], and Dizahab[^h1774]. 
###### 2
( There are eleven[^h259] [^h6240] days'[^h3117] journey from Horeb[^h2722] by the way[^h1870] of mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165] unto Kadeshbarnea[^h6947].)
###### 3
And it came to pass in the fortieth[^h705] year[^h8141], in the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240] month[^h2320], on the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], that Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], according unto all that the LORD[^h3068] had given him in commandment[^h6680] unto them;
###### 4
After[^h310] he had slain[^h5221] Sihon[^h5511] the king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which dwelt[^h3427] in Heshbon[^h2809], and Og[^h5747] the king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], which dwelt[^h3427] at Astaroth[^h6252] in Edrei[^h154]:
###### 5
On this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], in the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], began[^h2974] Moses[^h4872] to declare[^h874] this law[^h8451], saying[^h559],
###### 6
The LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] spake[^h1696] unto us in Horeb[^h2722], saying[^h559], Ye have dwelt[^h3427] long enough[^h7227] in this mount[^h2022]:
###### 7
Turn[^h6437] you, and take your journey[^h5265], and go[^h935] to the mount[^h2022] of the Amorites[^h567], and unto all the places nigh[^h7934] thereunto, in the plain[^h6160], in the hills[^h2022], and in the vale[^h8219], and in the south[^h5045], and by the sea[^h3220] side[^h2348], to the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], and unto Lebanon[^h3844], unto the great[^h1419] river[^h5104], the river[^h5104] Euphrates[^h6578]. 
###### 8
Behold[^h7200], I have set[^h5414] the land[^h776] before[^h6440] you: go[^h935] in and possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto your fathers[^h1], Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Jacob[^h3290], to give[^h5414] unto them and to their seed[^h2233] after[^h310] them. 
###### 9
And I spake[^h559] unto you at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559], I am not able[^h3201] to bear[^h5375] you myself alone[^h905]:
###### 10
The LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath multiplied[^h7235] you, and, behold, ye are this day[^h3117] as the stars[^h3556] of heaven[^h8064] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 11
(The LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1] make you a thousand[^h505] times[^h6471] so many more as[^h3254] ye are, and bless[^h1288] you, as he hath promised[^h1696] you!)
###### 12
How[^h349] can I myself alone bear[^h5375] your cumbrance[^h2960], and your burden[^h4853], and your strife[^h7379]?
###### 13
Take[^h3051] you wise[^h2450] men[^h582], and understanding[^h995], and known[^h3045] among your tribes[^h7626], and I will make[^h7760] them rulers[^h7218] over you. 
###### 14
And ye answered[^h6030] me, and said[^h559], The thing[^h1697] which thou hast spoken[^h1696] is good[^h2896] for us to do[^h6213].
###### 15
So I took[^h3947] the chief[^h7218] of your tribes[^h7626], wise[^h2450] men[^h582], and known[^h3045], and made[^h5414] them heads[^h7218] over you, captains[^h8269] over thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] over hundreds[^h3967], and captains[^h8269] over fifties[^h2572], and captains[^h8269] over tens[^h6235], and officers[^h7860] among your tribes[^h7626]. 
###### 16
And I charged[^h6680] your judges[^h8199] at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559], Hear[^h8085] the causes between your brethren[^h251], and judge[^h8199] righteously[^h6664] between every man[^h376] and his brother[^h251], and the stranger[^h1616] that is with him.
###### 17
Ye shall not respect[^h5234] persons[^h6440] in judgment[^h4941]; but ye shall hear[^h8085] the small[^h6996] as well as the great[^h1419]; ye shall not be afraid[^h1481] of the face[^h6440] of man[^h376]; for the judgment[^h4941] is God's[^h430]: and the cause[^h1697] that is too hard[^h7185] for you, bring[^h7126] it unto me, and I will hear[^h8085] it. 
###### 18
And I commanded[^h6680] you at that time[^h6256] all the things[^h1697] which ye should do[^h6213].
###### 19
And when we departed[^h5265] from Horeb[^h2722], we went through[^h3212] all that great[^h1419] and terrible[^h3372] wilderness[^h4057], which ye saw[^h7200] by the way[^h1870] of the mountain[^h2022] of the Amorites[^h567], as the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] us; and we came[^h935] to Kadeshbarnea[^h6947].
###### 20
And I said[^h559] unto you, Ye are come[^h935] unto the mountain[^h2022] of the Amorites[^h567], which the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] doth give[^h5414] unto us.
###### 21
Behold[^h7200], the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath set[^h5414] the land[^h776] before[^h6440] thee: go up[^h5927] and possess[^h3423] it, as the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of thy fathers[^h1] hath said[^h1696] unto thee; fear[^h3372] not, neither be discouraged[^h2865].
###### 22
And ye came near[^h7126] unto me every one of you, and said[^h559], We will send[^h7971] men[^h582] before[^h6440] us, and they shall search us out[^h2658] the land[^h776], and bring[^h7725] us word[^h1697] again[^h7725] by what way[^h1870] we must go up[^h5927], and into what cities[^h5892] we shall come[^h935].
###### 23
And the saying[^h1697] pleased me well[^h3190] [^h5869]: and I took[^h3947] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] men[^h582] of you, one[^h259] of a tribe[^h376] [^h7626]:
###### 24
And they turned[^h6437] and went up[^h5927] into the mountain[^h2022], and came[^h935] unto the valley[^h5158] of Eshcol[^h812], and searched it out[^h7270].
###### 25
And they took[^h3947] of the fruit[^h6529] of the land[^h776] in their hands[^h3027], and brought it down[^h3381] unto us, and brought[^h7725] us word[^h1697] again[^h7725], and said[^h559], It is a good[^h2896] land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] doth give[^h5414] us.
###### 26
Notwithstanding ye would[^h14] not go up[^h5927], but rebelled[^h4784] against the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]:
###### 27
And ye murmured[^h7279] in your tents[^h168], and said[^h559], Because the LORD[^h3068] hated[^h8135] us, he hath brought us forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], to deliver[^h5414] us into the hand[^h3027] of the Amorites[^h567], to destroy[^h8045] us.
###### 28
Whither shall we go up[^h5927]? our brethren[^h251] have discouraged[^h4549] our heart[^h3824], saying[^h559], The people[^h5971] is greater[^h1419] and taller[^h7311] than we; the cities[^h5892] are great[^h1419] and walled up[^h1219] to heaven[^h8064]; and moreover we have seen[^h7200] the sons[^h1121] of the Anakims[^h6062] there. 
###### 29
Then I said[^h559] unto you, Dread[^h6206] not, neither be afraid[^h3372] of them.
###### 30
The LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] which goeth[^h1980] before[^h6440] you, he shall fight[^h3898] for you, according to all that he did[^h6213] for you in Egypt[^h4714] before your eyes[^h5869];
###### 31
And in the wilderness[^h4057], where thou hast seen[^h7200] how that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] bare[^h5375] thee, as a man[^h376] doth bear[^h5375] his son[^h1121], in all the way[^h1870] that ye went[^h1980], until ye came[^h935] into this place[^h4725].
###### 32
Yet in this thing[^h1697] ye did not believe[^h539] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430],
###### 33
Who went[^h1980] in the way[^h1870] before[^h6440] you, to search you out[^h8446] a place[^h4725] to pitch your tents[^h2583] in, in fire[^h784] by night[^h3915], to shew[^h7200] you by what way[^h1870] ye should go[^h3212], and in a cloud[^h6051] by day[^h3119].
###### 34
And the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of your words[^h1697], and was wroth[^h7107], and sware[^h7650], saying[^h559],
###### 35
Surely there shall not one[^h376] of these men[^h582] of this evil[^h7451] generation[^h1755] see[^h7200] that good[^h2896] land[^h776], which I sware[^h7650] to give[^h5414] unto your fathers[^h1],
###### 36
Save[^h2108] Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312]; he shall see[^h7200] it, and to him will I give[^h5414] the land[^h776] that[^h834] he hath trodden upon[^h1869], and to his children[^h1121], because he hath wholly[^h4390] followed[^h310] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 37
Also the LORD[^h3068] was angry[^h599] with me for your sakes[^h1558], saying[^h559], Thou also shalt not go[^h935] in thither[^h8033].
###### 38
But Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], which standeth[^h5975] before[^h6440] thee, he shall go in[^h935] thither: encourage[^h2388] him: for he shall cause Israel[^h3478] to inherit[^h5157] it.
###### 39
Moreover your little ones[^h2945], which ye said[^h559] should be a prey[^h957], and your children[^h1121], which in that day[^h3117] had no knowledge[^h3045] between good[^h2896] and evil[^h7451], they shall go in[^h935] thither, and unto them will I give[^h5414] it, and they shall possess[^h3423] it.
###### 40
But as for you, turn[^h6437] you, and take your journey[^h5265] into the wilderness[^h4057] by the way[^h1870] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 41
Then ye answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] unto me, We have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], we will go up[^h5927] and fight[^h3898], according to all that the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] us. And when ye had girded[^h2296] on every man[^h376] his weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421], ye were ready[^h1951] to go up[^h5927] into the hill[^h2022].
###### 42
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Say[^h559] unto them, Go not up[^h5927], neither fight[^h3898]; for I am not among[^h7130] you; lest ye be smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] your enemies[^h341].
###### 43
So I spake[^h1696] unto you; and ye would not hear[^h8085], but rebelled[^h4784] against the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], and went[^h5927] presumptuously[^h2102] up[^h5927] into the hill[^h2022]. 
###### 44
And the Amorites[^h567], which dwelt[^h3427] in that mountain[^h2022], came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] you, and chased[^h7291] you, as bees[^h1682] do[^h6213], and destroyed[^h3807] you in Seir[^h8165], even unto Hormah[^h2767].
###### 45
And ye returned[^h7725] and wept[^h1058] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; but the LORD[^h3068] would not hearken[^h8085] to your voice[^h6963], nor give ear[^h238] unto you.
###### 46
So ye abode[^h3427] in Kadesh[^h6946] many[^h7227] days[^h3117], according unto the days[^h3117] that ye abode[^h3427] there.

###### 1
When thou goest out[^h3318] to battle[^h4421] against thine enemies[^h341], and seest[^h7200] horses[^h5483], and chariots[^h7393], and a people[^h5971] more[^h7227] than thou, be not afraid[^h3372] of them: for the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] is with thee, which brought thee up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 2
And it shall be, when ye are come nigh[^h7126] unto the battle[^h4421], that the priest[^h3548] shall approach[^h5066] and speak[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971],
###### 3
And shall say[^h559] unto them, Hear[^h8085], O Israel[^h3478], ye approach[^h7131] this day[^h3117] unto battle[^h4421] against your enemies[^h341]: let not your hearts[^h3824] faint[^h7401], fear[^h3372] not, and do not tremble[^h2648], neither be ye terrified[^h6206] because[^h6440] of them;  
###### 4
For the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] is he that goeth[^h1980] with you, to fight[^h3898] for you against your enemies[^h341], to save[^h3467] you.
###### 5
And the officers[^h7860] shall speak[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], What man[^h376] is there that hath built[^h1129] a new[^h2319] house[^h1004], and hath not dedicated[^h2596] it? let him go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] to his house[^h1004], lest he die[^h4191] in the battle[^h4421], and another[^h312] man[^h376] dedicate[^h2596] it.
###### 6
And what man[^h376] is he that hath planted[^h5193] a vineyard[^h3754], and hath not yet eaten[^h2490] of it? let him also go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] unto his house[^h1004], lest he die[^h4191] in the battle[^h4421], and another[^h312] man[^h376] eat[^h2490] of it. 
###### 7
And what man[^h376] is there that hath betrothed[^h781] a wife[^h802], and hath not taken[^h3947] her? let him go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] unto his house[^h1004], lest he die[^h4191] in the battle[^h4421], and another[^h312] man[^h376] take[^h3947] her.
###### 8
And the officers[^h7860] shall speak[^h1696] further[^h3254] unto the people[^h5971], and they shall say[^h559], What man[^h376] is there that is fearful[^h3373] and fainthearted[^h7390] [^h3824]? let him go[^h3212] and return[^h7725] unto his house[^h1004], lest his brethren's[^h251] heart[^h3824] faint[^h4549] as well as his heart[^h3824]. 
###### 9
And it shall be, when the officers[^h7860] have made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971], that they shall make[^h6485] captains[^h8269] of the armies[^h6635] to lead[^h7218] the people[^h5971]. 
###### 10
When thou comest nigh[^h7126] unto a city[^h5892] to fight[^h3898] against it, then proclaim[^h7121] peace[^h7965] unto it.
###### 11
And it shall be, if it make thee answer[^h6030] of peace[^h7965], and open[^h6605] unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people[^h5971] that is found[^h4672] therein shall be tributaries[^h4522] unto thee, and they shall serve[^h5647] thee.
###### 12
And if it will make no peace[^h7999] with thee, but will make[^h6213] war[^h4421] against thee, then thou shalt besiege[^h6696] it:
###### 13
And when the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] it into thine hands[^h3027], thou shalt smite[^h5221] every male[^h2138] thereof with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]:
###### 14
But the women[^h802], and the little ones[^h2945], and the cattle[^h929], and all that is in the city[^h5892], even all the spoil[^h7998] thereof, shalt thou take[^h962] unto thyself; and thou shalt eat[^h398] the spoil[^h7998] of thine enemies[^h341], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] thee. 
###### 15
Thus shalt thou do[^h6213] unto all the cities[^h5892] which are very[^h3966] far off[^h7350] from thee, which[^h2007] are not of the cities[^h5892] of these nations[^h1471].
###### 16
But of the cities[^h5892] of these people[^h5971], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] doth give[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159], thou shalt save alive[^h2421] nothing that breatheth[^h5397]:
###### 17
But thou shalt utterly[^h2763] destroy[^h2763] them; namely, the Hittites[^h2850], and the Amorites[^h567], the Canaanites[^h3669], and the Perizzites[^h6522], the Hivites[^h2340], and the Jebusites[^h2983]; as the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath commanded[^h6680] thee:
###### 18
That they teach[^h3925] you not to do[^h6213] after all their abominations[^h8441], which they have done[^h6213] unto their gods[^h430]; so should ye sin[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 19
When thou shalt besiege[^h6696] a city[^h5892] a long[^h7227] time[^h3117], in making war[^h3898] against it to take[^h8610] it, thou shalt not destroy[^h7843] the trees[^h6086] thereof by forcing[^h5080] an axe[^h1631] against them: for thou mayest eat[^h398] of them, and thou shalt not cut them down[^h3772] (for the tree[^h6086] of the field[^h7704] is man's[^h120] life ) to employ[^h935] them in the siege[^h6440] [^h4692]:  
###### 20
Only the trees[^h6086] which thou knowest[^h3045] that they be not trees[^h6086] for meat[^h3978], thou shalt destroy[^h7843] and cut them down[^h3772]; and thou shalt build[^h1129] bulwarks[^h4692] against the city[^h5892] that maketh[^h6213] war[^h4421] with thee, until it be subdued[^h3381].

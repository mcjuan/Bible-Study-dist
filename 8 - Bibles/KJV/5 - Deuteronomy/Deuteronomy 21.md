###### 1
If one be found[^h4672] slain[^h2491] in the land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee to possess[^h3423] it, lying[^h5307] in the field[^h7704], and it be not known[^h3045] who hath slain[^h5221] him:
###### 2
Then thy elders[^h2205] and thy judges[^h8199] shall come forth[^h3318], and they shall measure[^h4058] unto the cities[^h5892] which are round about[^h5439] him that is slain[^h2491]:
###### 3
And it shall be, that the city[^h5892] which is next[^h7138] unto the slain man[^h2491], even the elders[^h2205] of that city[^h5892] shall take[^h3947] an heifer[^h1241] [^h5697], which hath not been wrought with[^h5647], and which hath not drawn[^h4900] in the yoke[^h5923];
###### 4
And the elders[^h2205] of that city[^h5892] shall bring down[^h3381] the heifer[^h5697] unto a rough[^h386] valley[^h5158], which is neither eared[^h5647] nor sown[^h2232], and shall strike off[^h6202] the heifer's[^h5697] neck[^h6202] there in the valley[^h5158]:
###### 5
And the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] shall come near[^h5066]; for them the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath chosen[^h977] to minister[^h8334] unto him, and to bless[^h1288] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068]; and by their word[^h6310] shall every controversy[^h7379] and every stroke[^h5061] be tried: 
###### 6
And all the elders[^h2205] of that city[^h5892], that are next[^h7138] unto the slain[^h2491] man, shall wash[^h7364] their hands[^h3027] over the heifer[^h5697] that is beheaded[^h6202] in the valley[^h5158]:
###### 7
And they shall answer[^h6030] and say[^h559], Our hands[^h3027] have not shed[^h8210] this blood[^h1818], neither have our eyes[^h5869] seen[^h7200] it.
###### 8
Be merciful[^h3722], O LORD[^h3068], unto thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], whom thou hast redeemed[^h6299], and lay[^h5414] not innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] unto thy people[^h5971] of Israel's[^h3478] charge[^h7130]. And the blood[^h1818] shall be forgiven[^h3722] them. 
###### 9
So shalt thou put away[^h1197] the guilt of innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] from among[^h7130] you, when thou shalt do[^h6213] that which is right[^h3477] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
When thou goest forth[^h3318] to war[^h4421] against thine enemies[^h341], and the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] them into thine hands[^h3027], and thou hast taken[^h7617] them captive[^h7628],
###### 11
And seest[^h7200] among the captives[^h7633] a beautiful[^h8389] [^h3303] woman[^h802], and hast a desire[^h2836] unto her, that thou wouldest have her[^h3947] to thy wife[^h802];
###### 12
Then thou shalt bring[^h935] her home[^h8432] to thine house[^h1004]; and she shall shave[^h1548] her head[^h7218], and pare[^h6213] her nails[^h6856]; 
###### 13
And she shall put[^h5493] the raiment[^h8071] of her captivity[^h7628] from off her, and shall remain[^h3427] in thine house[^h1004], and bewail[^h1058] her father[^h1] and her mother[^h517] a full[^h3117] month[^h3391]: and after[^h310] that thou shalt go[^h935] in unto her, and be her husband[^h1166], and she shall be thy wife[^h802].
###### 14
And it shall be, if thou have no delight[^h2654] in her, then thou shalt let her go[^h7971] whither she will[^h5315]; but thou shalt not sell[^h4376] her at all[^h4376] for money[^h3701], thou shalt not make merchandise[^h6014] of her, because[^h834] thou hast humbled[^h6031] her.
###### 15
If a man[^h376] have two[^h8147] wives[^h802], one[^h259] beloved[^h157], and another[^h259] hated[^h8130], and they have born[^h3205] him children[^h1121], both the beloved[^h157] and the hated[^h8130]; and if the firstborn[^h1060] son[^h1121] be hers that was hated[^h8146]:
###### 16
Then it shall be, when[^h3117] he maketh his sons[^h1121] to inherit[^h5157] that which he hath, that he may[^h3201] not make the son[^h1121] of the beloved[^h157] firstborn[^h1069] before[^h6440] the son[^h1121] of the hated[^h8130], which is indeed the firstborn[^h1060]:
###### 17
But he shall acknowledge[^h5234] the son[^h1121] of the hated[^h8130] for the firstborn[^h1060], by giving[^h5414] him a double[^h8147] portion[^h6310] of all that he hath[^h4672]: for he is the beginning[^h7225] of his strength[^h202]; the right[^h4941] of the firstborn[^h1062] is his. 
###### 18
If a man[^h376] have a stubborn[^h5637] and rebellious[^h4784] son[^h1121], which will not obey[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of his father[^h1], or the voice[^h6963] of his mother[^h517], and that, when they have chastened[^h3256] him, will not hearken[^h8085] unto them:
###### 19
Then shall his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517] lay hold[^h8610] on him, and bring him out[^h3318] unto the elders[^h2205] of his city[^h5892], and unto the gate[^h8179] of his place[^h4725];
###### 20
And they shall say[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205] of his city[^h5892], This our son[^h1121] is stubborn[^h5637] and rebellious[^h4784], he will not obey[^h8085] our voice[^h6963]; he is a glutton[^h2151], and a drunkard[^h5433].
###### 21
And all the men[^h582] of his city[^h5892] shall stone[^h7275] him with stones[^h68], that he die[^h4191]: so shalt thou put[^h1197] evil[^h7451] away[^h1197] from among[^h7130] you; and all Israel[^h3478] shall hear[^h8085], and fear[^h3372].
###### 22
And if a man[^h376] have committed a sin[^h2399] worthy of[^h4941] death[^h4194], and he be to be put to death[^h4191], and thou hang[^h8518] him on a tree[^h6086]:
###### 23
His body[^h5038] shall not remain all night[^h3885] upon the tree[^h6086], but thou shalt in any wise[^h6912] bury[^h6912] him that day[^h3117]; (for he that is hanged[^h8518] is accursed[^h7045] of God[^h430];) that thy land[^h127] be not defiled[^h2930], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159].

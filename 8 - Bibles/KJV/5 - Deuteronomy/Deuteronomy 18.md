###### 1
The priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881], and all the tribe[^h7626] of Levi[^h3878], shall have no part[^h2506] nor inheritance[^h5159] with Israel[^h3478]: they shall eat[^h398] the offerings[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] made by fire[^h801], and his inheritance[^h5159].
###### 2
Therefore shall they have no inheritance[^h5159] among[^h7130] their brethren[^h251]: the LORD[^h3068] is their inheritance[^h5159], as he hath said[^h1696] unto them.
###### 3
And this shall be the priest's[^h3548] due[^h4941] from the people[^h5971], from them that offer[^h2076] a sacrifice[^h2077], whether it be ox[^h7794] or sheep[^h7716]; and they shall give[^h5414] unto the priest[^h3548] the shoulder[^h2220], and the two cheeks[^h3895], and the maw[^h6896].
###### 4
The firstfruit[^h7225] also of thy corn[^h1715], of thy wine[^h8492], and of thine oil[^h3323], and the first[^h7225] of the fleece[^h1488] of thy sheep[^h6629], shalt thou give[^h5414] him.
###### 5
For the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath chosen[^h977] him out of all thy tribes[^h7626], to stand[^h5975] to minister[^h8334] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], him and his sons[^h1121] for ever[^h3117].
###### 6
And if a Levite[^h3881] come[^h935] from any[^h259] of thy gates[^h8179] out of all Israel[^h3478], where he sojourned[^h1481], and come[^h935] with all the desire[^h185] of his mind[^h5315] unto the place[^h4725] which the LORD[^h3068] shall choose[^h977];
###### 7
Then he shall minister[^h8334] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], as all his brethren[^h251] the Levites[^h3881] do, which stand[^h5975] there before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
They shall have like portions[^h2506] to eat[^h398], beside that which cometh of the sale[^h4465] of his patrimony[^h1]. 
###### 9
When thou art come[^h935] into the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee, thou shalt not learn[^h3925] to do[^h6213] after the abominations[^h8441] of those nations[^h1471].
###### 10
There shall not be found[^h4672] among you any one that maketh his son[^h1121] or his daughter[^h1323] to pass[^h5674] through the fire[^h784], or that useth[^h7080] divination[^h7081], or an observer of times[^h6049], or an enchanter[^h5172], or a witch[^h3784],
###### 11
Or a charmer[^h2266] [^h2267], or a consulter[^h7592] with familiar spirits[^h178], or a wizard[^h3049], or a necromancer[^h1875] [^h4191].
###### 12
For all that do[^h6213] these things are an abomination[^h8441] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and because[^h1558] of these abominations[^h8441] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] doth drive them out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] thee.
###### 13
Thou shalt be perfect[^h8549] with the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]. 
###### 14
For these nations[^h1471], which thou shalt possess[^h3423], hearkened[^h8085] unto observers of times[^h6049], and unto diviners[^h7080]: but as for thee, the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath not suffered[^h5414] thee so to do. 
###### 15
The LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will raise up[^h6965] unto thee a Prophet[^h5030] from the midst[^h7130] of thee, of thy brethren[^h251], like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken[^h8085];
###### 16
According to all that thou desiredst[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] in Horeb[^h2722] in the day[^h3117] of the assembly[^h6951], saying[^h559], Let me not hear[^h8085] again[^h3254] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], neither let me see[^h7200] this great[^h1419] fire[^h784] any more, that I die[^h4191] not.
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, They have well[^h3190] spoken that which they have spoken[^h1696].
###### 18
I will raise them up[^h6965] a Prophet[^h5030] from among[^h7130] their brethren[^h251], like unto thee, and will put[^h5414] my words[^h1697] in his mouth[^h6310]; and he shall speak[^h1696] unto them all that I shall command[^h6680] him.
###### 19
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever[^h376] will not hearken[^h8085] unto my words[^h1697] which he shall speak[^h1696] in my name[^h8034], I will require[^h1875] it of him.
###### 20
But the prophet[^h5030], which shall presume[^h2102] to speak[^h1696] a word[^h1697] in my name[^h8034], which I have not commanded[^h6680] him to speak[^h1696], or that shall speak[^h1696] in the name[^h8034] of other[^h312] gods[^h430], even that prophet[^h5030] shall die[^h4191].
###### 21
And if thou say[^h559] in thine heart[^h3824], How shall we know[^h3045] the word[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath not spoken[^h1696]?
###### 22
When a prophet[^h5030] speaketh[^h1696] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], if the thing[^h1697] follow not, nor come to pass[^h935], that is the thing[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath not spoken[^h1696], but the prophet[^h5030] hath spoken[^h1696] it presumptuously[^h2087]: thou shalt not be afraid[^h1481] of him.

###### 1
Then we turned[^h6437], and went up[^h5927] the way[^h1870] to Bashan[^h1316]: and Og[^h5747] the king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316] came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] us, he and all his people[^h5971], to battle[^h4421] at Edrei[^h154].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Fear[^h3372] him not: for I will deliver[^h5414] him, and all his people[^h5971], and his land[^h776], into thy hand[^h3027]; and thou shalt do[^h6213] unto him as thou didst[^h6213] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which dwelt[^h3427] at Heshbon[^h2809].
###### 3
So the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] into our hands[^h3027] Og[^h5747] also, the king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], and all his people[^h5971]: and we smote[^h5221] him until none was left[^h7604] to him remaining[^h8300].
###### 4
And we took[^h3920] all his cities[^h5892] at that time[^h6256], there was not a city[^h7151] which we took[^h3947] not from them, threescore[^h8346] cities[^h5892], all the region[^h2256] of Argob[^h709], the kingdom[^h4467] of Og[^h5747] in Bashan[^h1316].
###### 5
All these cities[^h5892] were fenced[^h1219] with high[^h1364] walls[^h2346], gates[^h1817], and bars[^h1280]; beside unwalled[^h6521] towns[^h5892] a great[^h3966] many[^h7235].
###### 6
And we utterly destroyed[^h2763] them, as we did[^h6213] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], utterly destroying[^h2763] the men[^h4962], women[^h802], and children[^h2945], of every city[^h5892].
###### 7
But all the cattle[^h929], and the spoil[^h7998] of the cities[^h5892], we took for a prey[^h962] to ourselves.
###### 8
And we took[^h3947] at that time[^h6256] out[^h3947] of the hand[^h3027] of the two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567] the land[^h776] that was on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], from the river[^h5158] of Arnon[^h769] unto mount[^h2022] Hermon[^h2768];
###### 9
( Which Hermon[^h2768] the Sidonians[^h6722] call[^h7121] Sirion[^h8303]; and the Amorites[^h567] call[^h7121] it Shenir[^h8149];)
###### 10
All the cities[^h5892] of the plain[^h4334], and all Gilead[^h1568], and all Bashan[^h1316], unto Salchah[^h5548] and Edrei[^h154], cities[^h5892] of the kingdom[^h4467] of Og[^h5747] in Bashan[^h1316].
###### 11
For only Og[^h5747] king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316] remained[^h7604] of the remnant[^h3499] of giants[^h7497]; behold, his bedstead[^h6210] was a bedstead[^h6210] of iron[^h1270]; is it not[^h3808] in Rabbath[^h7237] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]? nine[^h8672] cubits[^h520] was the length[^h753] thereof, and four[^h702] cubits[^h520] the breadth[^h7341] of it, after the cubit[^h520] of a man[^h376].
###### 12
And this land[^h776], which we possessed[^h3423] at that time[^h6256], from Aroer[^h6177], which is by the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769], and half[^h2677] mount[^h2022] Gilead[^h1568], and the cities[^h5892] thereof, gave[^h5414] I unto the Reubenites[^h7206] and to the Gadites[^h1425].
###### 13
And the rest[^h3499] of Gilead[^h1568], and all Bashan[^h1316], being the kingdom[^h4467] of Og[^h5747], gave[^h5414] I unto the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519]; all the region[^h2256] of Argob[^h709], with all Bashan[^h1316], which[^h1931] was called[^h7121] the land[^h776] of giants[^h7497].
###### 14
Jair[^h2971] the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] took[^h3947] all the country[^h2256] of Argob[^h709] unto the coasts[^h1366] of Geshuri[^h1651] and Maachathi[^h4602]; and called[^h7121] them after his own name[^h8034], Bashanhavothjair[^h1316] [^h2334], unto this day[^h3117].
###### 15
And I gave[^h5414] Gilead[^h1568] unto Machir[^h4353].
###### 16
And unto the Reubenites[^h7206] and unto the Gadites[^h1425] I gave[^h5414] from Gilead[^h1568] even unto the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769] half[^h8432] the valley[^h5158], and the border[^h1366] even unto the river[^h5158] Jabbok[^h2999], which is the border[^h1366] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983];
###### 17
The plain[^h6160] also, and Jordan[^h3383], and the coast[^h1366] thereof, from Chinnereth[^h3672] even unto the sea[^h3220] of the plain[^h6160], even the salt[^h4417] sea[^h3220], under Ashdothpisgah[^h798] [^h794] eastward[^h4217]. 
###### 18
And I commanded[^h6680] you at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] you this land[^h776] to possess[^h3423] it: ye shall pass over[^h5674] armed[^h2502] before[^h6440] your brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], all that are meet[^h1121] for the war[^h2428]. 
###### 19
But your wives[^h802], and your little ones[^h2945], and your cattle[^h4735], ( for I know[^h3045] that ye have much[^h7227] cattle[^h4735],) shall abide[^h3427] in your cities[^h5892] which I have given[^h5414] you;
###### 20
Until the LORD[^h3068] have given rest[^h5117] unto your brethren[^h251], as well as unto you, and until they also possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] them beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]: and then shall ye return[^h7725] every man[^h376] unto his possession[^h3425], which I have given[^h5414] you.
###### 21
And I commanded[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091] at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559], Thine eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200] all that the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath done[^h6213] unto these two[^h8147] kings[^h4428]: so shall the LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] unto all the kingdoms[^h4467] whither thou passest[^h5674].
###### 22
Ye shall not fear[^h3372] them: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] he shall fight[^h3898] for you.
###### 23
And I besought[^h2603] the LORD[^h3068] at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559],
###### 24
O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], thou hast begun[^h2490] to shew[^h7200] thy servant[^h5650] thy greatness[^h1433], and thy mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027]: for what God[^h410] is there in heaven[^h8064] or in earth[^h776], that can do[^h6213] according to thy works[^h4639], and according to thy might[^h1369]?
###### 25
I pray thee, let me go over[^h5674], and see[^h7200] the good[^h2896] land[^h776] that is beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], that goodly[^h2896] mountain[^h2022], and Lebanon[^h3844].
###### 26
But the LORD[^h3068] was wroth[^h5674] with me for your sakes, and would not hear[^h8085] me: and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Let it suffice[^h7227] thee; speak[^h1696] no more[^h3254] unto me of this matter[^h1697].
###### 27
Get thee up[^h5927] into the top[^h7218] of Pisgah[^h6449], and lift up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] westward[^h3220], and northward[^h6828], and southward[^h8486], and eastward[^h4217], and behold[^h7200] it with thine eyes[^h5869]: for thou shalt not go over[^h5674] this Jordan[^h3383]. 
###### 28
But charge[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091], and encourage[^h2388] him, and strengthen[^h553] him: for he shall go over[^h5674] before[^h6440] this people[^h5971], and he shall cause them to inherit[^h5157] the land[^h776] which thou shalt see[^h7200].
###### 29
So we abode[^h3427] in the valley[^h1516] over against[^h4136] Bethpeor[^h1047].

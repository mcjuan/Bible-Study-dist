###### 1
At that time[^h6256] the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Hew[^h6458] thee two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68] like unto the first[^h7223], and come up[^h5927] unto me into the mount[^h2022], and make[^h6213] thee an ark[^h727] of wood[^h6086].
###### 2
And I will write[^h3789] on the tables[^h3871] the words[^h1697] that were in the first[^h7223] tables[^h3871] which thou brakest[^h7665], and thou shalt put[^h7760] them in the ark[^h727].
###### 3
And I made[^h6213] an ark[^h727] of shittim[^h7848] wood[^h6086], and hewed[^h6458] two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68] like unto the first[^h7223], and went up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022], having the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] in mine hand[^h3027].
###### 4
And he wrote[^h3789] on the tables[^h3871], according to the first[^h7223] writing[^h4385], the ten[^h6235] commandments[^h1697], which the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto you in the mount[^h2022] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784] in the day[^h3117] of the assembly[^h6951]: and the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] them unto me. 
###### 5
And I turned[^h6437] myself and came down[^h3381] from the mount[^h2022], and put[^h7760] the tables[^h3871] in the ark[^h727] which I had made[^h6213]; and there they be, as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] me.
###### 6
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] took their journey[^h5265] from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan[^h885] to Mosera[^h4149]: there Aaron[^h175] died[^h4191], and there he was buried[^h6912]; and Eleazar[^h499] his son[^h1121] ministered in the priest's office[^h3547] in his stead.
###### 7
From thence they journeyed[^h5265] unto Gudgodah[^h1412]; and from Gudgodah[^h1412] to Jotbath[^h3193], a land[^h776] of rivers[^h5158] of waters[^h4325].
###### 8
At that time[^h6256] the LORD[^h3068] separated[^h914] the tribe[^h7626] of Levi[^h3878], to bear[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] to minister[^h8334] unto him, and to bless[^h1288] in his name[^h8034], unto this day[^h3117].
###### 9
Wherefore Levi[^h3878] hath no part[^h2506] nor inheritance[^h5159] with his brethren[^h251]; the LORD[^h3068] is his inheritance[^h5159], according as the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] promised[^h1696] him.
###### 10
And I stayed[^h5975] in the mount[^h2022], according to the first[^h7223] time[^h3117], forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915]; and the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] unto me at that time[^h6471] also, and the LORD[^h3068] would[^h14] not destroy[^h7843] thee. 
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Arise[^h6965], take[^h3212] thy journey[^h4550] before[^h6440] the people[^h5971], that they may go in[^h935] and possess[^h3423] the land[^h776], which I sware[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] unto them. 
###### 12
And now, Israel[^h3478], what doth the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] require[^h7592] of thee, but to fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in all his ways[^h1870], and to love[^h157] him, and to serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] with all thy heart[^h3824] and with all thy soul[^h5315],
###### 13
To keep[^h8104] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068], and his statutes[^h2708], which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117] for thy good[^h2896]?
###### 14
Behold, the heaven[^h8064] and the heaven[^h8064] of heavens[^h8064] is the LORD'S[^h3068] thy God[^h430], the earth[^h776] also, with all that therein is.
###### 15
Only the LORD[^h3068] had a delight[^h2836] in thy fathers[^h1] to love[^h157] them, and he chose[^h977] their seed[^h2233] after[^h310] them, even you above all people[^h5971], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 16
Circumcise[^h4135] therefore the foreskin[^h6190] of your heart[^h3824], and be no more stiffnecked[^h6203] [^h7185].
###### 17
For the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] is God[^h430] of gods[^h430], and Lord[^h113] of lords[^h113], a great[^h1419] God[^h410], a mighty[^h1368], and a terrible[^h3372], which regardeth[^h5375] not persons[^h6440], nor taketh[^h3947] reward[^h7810]:
###### 18
He doth execute[^h6213] the judgment[^h4941] of the fatherless[^h3490] and widow[^h490], and loveth[^h157] the stranger[^h1616], in giving[^h5414] him food[^h3899] and raiment[^h8071].
###### 19
Love[^h157] ye therefore the stranger[^h1616]: for ye were strangers[^h1616] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 20
Thou shalt fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]; him shalt thou serve[^h5647], and to him shalt thou cleave[^h1692], and swear[^h7650] by his name[^h8034].
###### 21
He is thy praise[^h8416], and he is thy God[^h430], that hath done[^h6213] for thee these great[^h1419] and terrible things[^h3372], which thine eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200].
###### 22
Thy fathers[^h1] went down[^h3381] into Egypt[^h4714] with threescore and ten[^h7657] persons[^h5315]; and now the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath made[^h7760] thee as the stars[^h3556] of heaven[^h8064] for multitude[^h7230].

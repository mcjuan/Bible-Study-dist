###### 1
Now therefore hearken[^h8085], O Israel[^h3478], unto the statutes[^h2706] and unto the judgments[^h4941], which I teach[^h3925] you, for to do[^h6213] them, that ye may live[^h2421], and go in[^h935] and possess[^h3423] the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1] giveth[^h5414] you.
###### 2
Ye shall not add[^h3254] unto the word[^h1697] which I command[^h6680] you, neither shall ye diminish[^h1639] ought from it, that ye may keep[^h8104] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] which I command[^h6680] you.
###### 3
Your eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200] what the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] because of Baalpeor[^h1187]: for all the men[^h376] that followed[^h310] [^h1980] Baalpeor[^h1187], the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath destroyed[^h8045] them from among[^h7130] you.
###### 4
But ye that did cleave[^h1695] unto the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] are alive[^h2416] every one of you this day[^h3117].
###### 5
Behold[^h7200], I have taught[^h3925] you statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941], even as[^h834] the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] me, that ye should do[^h6213] so in[^h7130] the land[^h776] whither ye go[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 6
Keep[^h8104] therefore and do[^h6213] them; for this is your wisdom[^h2451] and your understanding[^h998] in the sight[^h5869] of the nations[^h5971], which shall hear[^h8085] all these statutes[^h2706], and say[^h559], Surely this great[^h1419] nation[^h1471] is a wise[^h2450] and understanding[^h995] people[^h5971].
###### 7
For what nation[^h1471] is there so great[^h1419], who hath God[^h430] so nigh[^h7138] unto them, as the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] is in all things that we call[^h7121] upon him for?
###### 8
And what nation[^h1471] is there so great[^h1419], that hath statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941] so righteous[^h6662] as all this law[^h8451], which I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you this day[^h3117]?
###### 9
Only take heed[^h8104] to thyself, and keep[^h8104] thy soul[^h5315] diligently[^h3966], lest thou forget[^h7911] the things[^h1697] which thine eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200], and lest they depart[^h5493] from thy heart[^h3824] all the days[^h3117] of thy life[^h2416]: but teach[^h3045] them thy sons[^h1121], and thy sons'[^h1121] sons[^h1121];
###### 10
Specially the day[^h3117] that thou stoodest[^h5975] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] in Horeb[^h2722], when the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Gather[^h6950] me the people[^h5971] together[^h6950], and I will make them hear[^h8085] my words[^h1697], that they may learn[^h3925] to fear[^h3372] me all the days[^h3117] that they shall live[^h2416] upon the earth[^h127], and that they may teach[^h3925] their children[^h1121].
###### 11
And ye came near[^h7126] and stood[^h5975] under the mountain[^h2022]; and the mountain[^h2022] burned[^h1197] with fire[^h784] unto the midst[^h3820] of heaven[^h8064], with darkness[^h6205], clouds[^h6051], and thick darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto you out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784]: ye heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the words[^h1697], but saw[^h7200] no similitude[^h8544]; only[^h2108] ye heard a voice[^h6963]. 
###### 13
And he declared[^h5046] unto you his covenant[^h1285], which he commanded[^h6680] you to perform[^h6213], even ten[^h6235] commandments[^h1697]; and he wrote[^h3789] them upon two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] me at that time[^h6256] to teach[^h3925] you statutes[^h2706] and judgments[^h4941], that ye might do[^h6213] them in the land[^h776] whither ye go over[^h5674] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 15
Take ye therefore good[^h3966] heed[^h8104] unto yourselves[^h5315]; for ye saw[^h7200] no manner of similitude[^h8544] on the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto you in Horeb[^h2722] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784]:
###### 16
Lest ye corrupt[^h7843] yourselves, and make[^h6213] you a graven image[^h6459], the similitude[^h8544] of any figure[^h5566], the likeness[^h8403] of male[^h2145] or female[^h5347],
###### 17
The likeness[^h8403] of any beast[^h929] that is on the earth[^h776], the likeness[^h8403] of any winged[^h3671] fowl[^h6833] that flieth[^h5774] in the air[^h8064],
###### 18
The likeness[^h8403] of any thing that creepeth[^h7430] on the ground[^h127], the likeness[^h8403] of any fish[^h1710] that is in the waters[^h4325] beneath[^h8478] the earth[^h776]:
###### 19
And lest thou lift up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] unto heaven[^h8064], and when thou seest[^h7200] the sun[^h8121], and the moon[^h3394], and the stars[^h3556], even all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], shouldest be driven[^h5080] to worship[^h7812] them, and serve[^h5647] them, which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath divided[^h2505] unto all nations[^h5971] under the whole heaven[^h8064]. 
###### 20
But the LORD[^h3068] hath taken[^h3947] you, and brought you forth[^h3318] out of the iron[^h1270] furnace[^h3564], even out of Egypt[^h4714], to be unto him a people[^h5971] of inheritance[^h5159], as ye are this day[^h3117].
###### 21
Furthermore the LORD[^h3068] was angry[^h599] with me for your sakes[^h1697], and sware[^h7650] that I should not go over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and that I should not go[^h935] in unto that good[^h2896] land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee for an inheritance[^h5159]:
###### 22
But I must die[^h4191] in this land[^h776], I must not go over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383]: but ye shall go over[^h5674], and possess[^h3423] that good[^h2896] land[^h776].
###### 23
Take heed[^h8104] unto yourselves, lest ye forget[^h7911] the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which he made[^h3772] with you, and make[^h6213] you a graven image[^h6459], or the likeness[^h8544] of any[^h3605] thing, which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath forbidden[^h6680] thee.
###### 24
For the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] is a consuming[^h398] fire[^h784], even a jealous[^h7067] God[^h410].
###### 25
When thou shalt beget[^h3205] children[^h1121], and children's[^h1121] children[^h1121], and ye shall have remained long[^h3462] in the land[^h776], and shall corrupt[^h7843] yourselves, and make[^h6213] a graven image[^h6459], or the likeness[^h8544] of any thing, and shall do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], to provoke him to anger[^h3707]:
###### 26
I call[^h5749] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776] to witness[^h5749] against you this day[^h3117], that ye shall soon[^h4118] utterly[^h6] perish[^h6] from off the land[^h776] whereunto ye go over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to possess[^h3423] it; ye shall not prolong[^h748] your days[^h3117] upon it, but shall utterly[^h8045] be destroyed[^h8045].
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] shall scatter[^h6327] you among the nations[^h5971], and ye shall be left[^h7604] few[^h4962] in number[^h4557] among the heathen[^h1471], whither the LORD[^h3068] shall lead[^h5090] you.
###### 28
And there ye shall serve[^h5647] gods[^h430], the work[^h4639] of men's[^h120] hands[^h3027], wood[^h6086] and stone[^h68], which neither see[^h7200], nor hear[^h8085], nor eat[^h398], nor smell[^h7306].
###### 29
But if from thence thou shalt seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], thou shalt find[^h4672] him, if thou seek[^h1875] him with all thy heart[^h3824] and with all thy soul[^h5315].
###### 30
When thou art in tribulation[^h6862], and all these things[^h1697] are come[^h4672] upon thee, even in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117], if thou turn[^h7725] to the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and shalt be obedient[^h8085] unto his voice[^h6963]; 
###### 31
(For the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] is a merciful[^h7349] God[^h410];) he will not forsake[^h7503] thee, neither destroy[^h7843] thee, nor forget[^h7911] the covenant[^h1285] of thy fathers[^h1] which he sware[^h7650] unto them.
###### 32
For ask[^h7592] now of the days[^h3117] that are past[^h7223], which were[^h1961] before[^h6440] thee, since the day[^h3117] that God[^h430] created[^h1254] man[^h120] upon the earth[^h776], and ask from the one side[^h7097] of heaven[^h8064] unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great[^h1419] thing[^h1697] is, or hath been heard[^h8085] like it?
###### 33
Did ever people[^h5971] hear[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of God[^h430] speaking out[^h1696] of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784], as thou hast heard[^h8085], and live[^h2421]?
###### 34
Or hath God[^h430] assayed[^h5254] to go[^h935] and take[^h3947] him a nation[^h1471] from the midst[^h7130] of another nation[^h1471], by temptations[^h4531], by signs[^h226], and by wonders[^h4159], and by war[^h4421], and by a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and by a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220], and by great[^h1419] terrors[^h4172], according to all that the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] did[^h6213] for you in Egypt[^h4714] before your eyes[^h5869]?
###### 35
Unto thee it was shewed[^h7200], that thou mightest know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] he is God[^h430]; there is none else[^h5750] beside him[^h905].
###### 36
Out of heaven[^h8064] he made thee to hear[^h8085] his voice[^h6963], that he might instruct[^h3256] thee: and upon earth[^h776] he shewed[^h7200] thee his great[^h1419] fire[^h784]; and thou heardest[^h8085] his words[^h1697] out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784].
###### 37
And because he loved[^h157] thy fathers[^h1], therefore he chose[^h977] their seed[^h2233] after[^h310] them, and brought thee out[^h3318] in his sight[^h6440] with his mighty[^h1419] power[^h3581] out of Egypt[^h4714];
###### 38
To drive out[^h3423] nations[^h1471] from before[^h6440] thee greater[^h1419] and mightier[^h6099] than thou art, to bring[^h935] thee in, to give[^h5414] thee their land[^h776] for an inheritance[^h5159], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 39
Know[^h3045] therefore this day[^h3117], and consider[^h7725] it in thine heart[^h3824], that the LORD[^h3068] he is God[^h430] in heaven[^h8064] above[^h4605], and upon the earth[^h776] beneath: there is none else.
###### 40
Thou shalt keep[^h8104] therefore his statutes[^h2706], and his commandments[^h4687], which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117], that it may go well[^h3190] with thee, and with thy children[^h1121] after[^h310] thee, and that thou mayest prolong[^h748] thy days[^h3117] upon the earth[^h127], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] giveth[^h5414] thee, for ever.
###### 41
Then Moses[^h4872] severed[^h914] three[^h7969] cities[^h5892] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] toward the sunrising[^h8121] [^h4217];
###### 42
That the slayer[^h7523] might flee[^h5127] thither, which should kill[^h7523] his neighbour[^h7453] unawares[^h1097] [^h1847], and hated[^h8130] him not in times[^h8543] past[^h8032]; and that fleeing[^h5127] unto one[^h259] of these[^h411] cities[^h5892] he might live[^h2425]:
###### 43
Namely, Bezer[^h1221] in the wilderness[^h4057], in the plain[^h4334] country[^h776], of the Reubenites[^h7206]; and Ramoth[^h7216] in Gilead[^h1568], of the Gadites[^h1425]; and Golan[^h1474] in Bashan[^h1316], of the Manassites[^h4520].
###### 44
And this is the law[^h8451] which Moses[^h4872] set[^h7760] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 45
These are the testimonies[^h5713], and the statutes[^h2706], and the judgments[^h4941], which Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], after they came forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714],
###### 46
On this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], in the valley[^h1516] over against[^h4136] Bethpeor[^h1047], in the land[^h776] of Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], who dwelt[^h3427] at Heshbon[^h2809], whom Moses[^h4872] and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] smote[^h5221], after they were come forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 47
And they possessed[^h3423] his land[^h776], and the land[^h776] of Og[^h5747] king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which were on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] toward the sunrising[^h4217] [^h8121];
###### 48
From Aroer[^h6177], which is by the bank[^h8193] of the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769], even unto mount[^h2022] Sion[^h7865], which is Hermon[^h2768],
###### 49
And all the plain[^h6160] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] eastward[^h4217], even unto the sea[^h3220] of the plain[^h6160], under the springs[^h794] of Pisgah[^h6449].

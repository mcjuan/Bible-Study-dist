###### 1
These are the words[^h1697] of the covenant[^h1285], which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] to make[^h3772] with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], beside the covenant[^h1285] which he made[^h3772] with them in Horeb[^h2722].
###### 2
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] unto all Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto them, Ye have seen[^h7200] all that the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] before your eyes[^h5869] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and unto all his servants[^h5650], and unto all his land[^h776];
###### 3
The great[^h1419] temptations[^h4531] which thine eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200], the signs[^h226], and those great[^h1419] miracles[^h4159]:
###### 4
Yet the LORD[^h3068] hath not given[^h5414] you an heart[^h3820] to perceive[^h3045], and eyes[^h5869] to see[^h7200], and ears[^h241] to hear[^h8085], unto this day[^h3117].
###### 5
And I have led[^h3212] you forty[^h705] years[^h8141] in the wilderness[^h4057]: your clothes[^h8008] are not waxen old[^h1086] upon you, and thy shoe[^h5275] is not waxen old[^h1086] upon thy foot[^h7272].
###### 6
Ye have not eaten[^h398] bread[^h3899], neither have ye drunk[^h8354] wine[^h3196] or strong drink[^h7941]: that ye might know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 7
And when ye came[^h935] unto this place[^h4725], Sihon[^h5511] the king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], and Og[^h5747] the king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] us unto battle[^h4421], and we smote[^h5221] them:
###### 8
And we took[^h3947] their land[^h776], and gave[^h5414] it for an inheritance[^h5159] unto the Reubenites[^h7206], and to the Gadites[^h1425], and to the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4520].
###### 9
Keep[^h8104] therefore the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285], and do[^h6213] them, that ye may prosper[^h7919] in all that ye do[^h6213].
###### 10
Ye stand[^h5324] this day[^h3117] all of you before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; your captains[^h7218] of your tribes[^h7626], your elders[^h2205], and your officers[^h7860], with all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478],
###### 11
Your little ones[^h2945], your wives[^h802], and thy stranger[^h1616] that is in[^h7130] thy camp[^h4264], from the hewer[^h2404] of thy wood[^h6086] unto the drawer[^h7579] of thy water[^h4325]:
###### 12
That thou shouldest enter[^h5674] into covenant[^h1285] with the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and into his oath[^h423], which the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] maketh[^h3772] with thee this day[^h3117]: 
###### 13
That he may establish[^h6965] thee to day[^h3117] for a people[^h5971] unto himself, and that he may be unto thee a God[^h430], as he hath said[^h1696] unto thee, and as he hath sworn[^h7650] unto thy fathers[^h1], to Abraham[^h85], to Isaac[^h3327], and to Jacob[^h3290].
###### 14
Neither with you only do I make[^h3772] this covenant[^h1285] and this oath[^h423];
###### 15
But with him that standeth[^h5975] here with us this[^h3426] day[^h3117] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], and also with him that is not here with us this day[^h3117]:
###### 16
(For ye know[^h3045] how we have dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; and how we came[^h5674] through[^h7130] the nations[^h1471] which ye passed by[^h5674];
###### 17
And ye have seen[^h7200] their abominations[^h8251], and their idols[^h1544], wood[^h6086] and stone[^h68], silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], which were among them:) 
###### 18
Lest there should be[^h3426] among you man[^h376], or woman[^h802], or family[^h4940], or tribe[^h7626], whose heart[^h3824] turneth away[^h6437] this day[^h3117] from the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], to go[^h3212] and serve[^h5647] the gods[^h430] of these nations[^h1471]; lest there should be[^h3426] among you a root[^h8328] that beareth[^h6509] gall[^h7219] and wormwood[^h3939]; 
###### 19
And it come to pass, when he heareth[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of this curse[^h423], that he bless[^h1288] himself in his heart[^h3824], saying[^h559], I shall have peace[^h7965], though[^h3588] I walk[^h3212] in the imagination[^h8307] of mine heart[^h3820], to add[^h5595] drunkenness[^h7302] to thirst[^h6771]:  
###### 20
The LORD[^h3068] will[^h14] not spare[^h5545] him, but then the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] and his jealousy[^h7068] shall smoke[^h6225] against that man[^h376], and all the curses[^h423] that are written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612] shall lie[^h7257] upon him, and the LORD[^h3068] shall blot out[^h4229] his name[^h8034] from under heaven[^h8064].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] shall separate[^h914] him unto evil[^h7451] out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], according to all the curses[^h423] of the covenant[^h1285] that are written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451]: 
###### 22
So that the generation[^h1755] to come[^h314] of your children[^h1121] that shall rise up[^h6965] after[^h310] you, and the stranger[^h5237] that shall come[^h935] from a far[^h7350] land[^h776], shall say[^h559], when they see[^h7200] the plagues[^h4347] of that land[^h776], and the sicknesses[^h8463] which the LORD[^h3068] hath laid[^h2470] upon it; 
###### 23
And that the whole land[^h776] thereof is brimstone[^h1614], and salt[^h4417], and burning[^h8316], that it is not sown[^h2232], nor beareth[^h6779], nor any grass[^h6212] groweth[^h5927] therein, like the overthrow[^h4114] of Sodom[^h5467], and Gomorrah[^h6017], Admah[^h126], and Zeboim[^h6636], which the LORD[^h3068] overthrew[^h2015] in his anger[^h639], and in his wrath[^h2534]:
###### 24
Even all nations[^h1471] shall say[^h559], Wherefore hath the LORD[^h3068] done[^h6213] thus unto this land[^h776]? what meaneth the heat[^h2750] of this great[^h1419] anger[^h639]?
###### 25
Then men shall say[^h559], Because they have forsaken[^h5800] the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], which he made[^h3772] with them when he brought them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 26
For they went[^h3212] and served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and worshipped[^h7812] them, gods[^h430] whom they knew[^h3045] not, and whom he had not given[^h2505] unto them:  
###### 27
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against this land[^h776], to bring[^h935] upon it all the curses[^h7045] that are written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612]:
###### 28
And the LORD[^h3068] rooted[^h5428] them out of their land[^h127] in anger[^h639], and in wrath[^h2534], and in great[^h1419] indignation[^h7110], and cast[^h7993] them into another[^h312] land[^h776], as it is this day[^h3117].
###### 29
The secret[^h5641] things belong unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]: but those things which are revealed[^h1540] belong unto us and to our children[^h1121] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], that we may do[^h6213] all the words[^h1697] of this law[^h8451].

###### 1
And Moses[^h4872] went[^h3212] and spake[^h1696] these words[^h1697] unto all Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto them, I am an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] this day[^h3117]; I can[^h3201] no more go out[^h3318] and come in[^h935]: also the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h559] unto me, Thou shalt not go over[^h5674] this Jordan[^h3383].
###### 3
The LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], he will go over[^h5674] before[^h6440] thee, and he will destroy[^h8045] these nations[^h1471] from before[^h6440] thee, and thou shalt possess[^h3423] them: and Joshua[^h3091], he shall go over[^h5674] before[^h6440] thee, as the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696].
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] shall do[^h6213] unto them as he did[^h6213] to Sihon[^h5511] and to Og[^h5747], kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], and unto the land[^h776] of them, whom he destroyed[^h8045].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] shall give them up[^h5414] before your face[^h6440], that ye may do[^h6213] unto them according unto all the commandments[^h4687] which I have commanded[^h6680] you.
###### 6
Be strong[^h2388] and of a good courage[^h553], fear[^h3372] not, nor be afraid[^h6206] of them[^h6440]: for the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], he it is that doth go[^h1980] with thee; he will not fail[^h7503] thee, nor forsake[^h5800] thee.
###### 7
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] unto Joshua[^h3091], and said[^h559] unto him in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478], Be strong[^h2388] and of a good courage[^h553]: for thou must go[^h935] with this people[^h5971] unto the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] hath sworn[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit[^h5157] it.
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068], he it is that doth go[^h1980] before[^h6440] thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail[^h7503] thee, neither forsake[^h5800] thee: fear[^h3372] not, neither be dismayed[^h2865].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] wrote[^h3789] this law[^h8451], and delivered[^h5414] it unto the priests[^h3548] the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], which bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and unto all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
And Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], At the end[^h7093] of every seven[^h7651] years[^h8141], in the solemnity[^h4150] of the year[^h8141] of release[^h8059], in the feast[^h2282] of tabernacles[^h5521],
###### 11
When all Israel[^h3478] is come[^h935] to appear[^h7200] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] in the place[^h4725] which he shall choose[^h977], thou shalt read[^h7121] this law[^h8451] before all Israel[^h3478] in their hearing[^h241].
###### 12
Gather[^h6950] the people[^h5971] together[^h6950], men[^h582], and women[^h802], and children[^h2945], and thy stranger[^h1616] that is within thy gates[^h8179], that they may hear[^h8085], and that they may learn[^h3925], and fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and observe[^h8104] to do[^h6213] all the words[^h1697] of this law[^h8451]:
###### 13
And that their children[^h1121], which have not known[^h3045] any thing, may hear[^h8085], and learn[^h3925] to fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], as long as[^h3117] ye live[^h2416] in the land[^h127] whither ye go over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Behold, thy days[^h3117] approach[^h7126] that thou must die[^h4191]: call[^h7121] Joshua[^h3091], and present[^h3320] yourselves in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], that I may give him a charge[^h6680]. And Moses[^h4872] and Joshua[^h3091] went[^h3212], and presented[^h3320] themselves in the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] in the tabernacle[^h168] in a pillar[^h5982] of a cloud[^h6051]: and the pillar[^h5982] of the cloud[^h6051] stood[^h5975] over the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168].
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Behold, thou shalt sleep[^h7901] with thy fathers[^h1]; and this people[^h5971] will rise up[^h6965], and go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] the gods[^h430] of the strangers[^h5236] of the land[^h776], whither they go[^h935] to be among[^h7130] them, and will forsake[^h5800] me, and break[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285] which I have made[^h3772] with them. 
###### 17
Then my anger[^h639] shall be kindled[^h2734] against them in that day[^h3117], and I will forsake[^h5800] them, and I will hide[^h5641] my face[^h6440] from them, and they shall be devoured[^h398], and many[^h7227] evils[^h7451] and troubles[^h6869] shall befall[^h4672] them; so that they will say[^h559] in that day[^h3117], Are not these evils[^h7451] come[^h4672] upon us, because our God[^h430] is not among[^h7130] us? 
###### 18
And I will surely[^h5641] hide[^h5641] my face[^h6440] in that day[^h3117] for all the evils[^h7451] which they shall have wrought[^h6213], in that[^h3588] they are turned[^h6437] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 19
Now therefore write[^h3789] ye this song[^h7892] for you, and teach[^h3925] it the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: put[^h7760] it in their mouths[^h6310], that this song[^h7892] may be a witness[^h5707] for me against the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 20
For when I shall have brought[^h935] them into the land[^h127] which I sware[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1], that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706]; and they shall have eaten[^h398] and filled[^h7646] themselves, and waxen fat[^h1878]; then will they turn[^h6437] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], and serve[^h5647] them, and provoke[^h5006] me, and break[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285].
###### 21
And it shall come to pass, when many[^h7227] evils[^h7451] and troubles[^h6869] are befallen[^h4672] them, that this song[^h7892] shall testify[^h6030] against[^h6440] them as a witness[^h5707]; for it shall not be forgotten[^h7911] out of the mouths[^h6310] of their seed[^h2233]: for I know[^h3045] their imagination[^h3336] which they go about[^h6213], even now[^h3117], before I have brought[^h935] them into the land[^h776] which I sware[^h7650].  
###### 22
Moses[^h4872] therefore wrote[^h3789] this song[^h7892] the same day[^h3117], and taught[^h3925] it the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 23
And he gave Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126] a charge[^h6680], and said[^h559], Be strong[^h2388] and of a good courage[^h553]: for thou shalt bring[^h935] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] into the land[^h776] which I sware[^h7650] unto them: and I will be with thee.
###### 24
And it came to pass, when Moses[^h4872] had made an end[^h3615] of writing[^h3789] the words[^h1697] of this law[^h8451] in a book[^h5612], until they were finished[^h8552],
###### 25
That Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] the Levites[^h3881], which bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 26
Take[^h3947] this book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451], and put[^h7760] it in the side[^h6654] of the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], that it may be there for a witness[^h5707] against thee.
###### 27
For I know[^h3045] thy rebellion[^h4805], and thy stiff[^h7186] neck[^h6203]: behold, while I am yet alive[^h2416] with you this day[^h3117], ye have been rebellious[^h4784] against the LORD[^h3068]; and how much more after[^h310] my death[^h4194]?
###### 28
Gather[^h6950] unto me all the elders[^h2205] of your tribes[^h7626], and your officers[^h7860], that I may speak[^h1696] these words[^h1697] in their ears[^h241], and call[^h5749] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776] to record[^h5749] against them.
###### 29
For I know[^h3045] that after[^h310] my death[^h4194] ye will utterly[^h7843] corrupt[^h7843] yourselves, and turn aside[^h5493] from the way[^h1870] which I have commanded[^h6680] you; and evil[^h7451] will befall[^h7122] you in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117]; because ye will do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], to provoke him to anger[^h3707] through the work[^h4639] of your hands[^h3027].
###### 30
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] in the ears[^h241] of all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478] the words[^h1697] of this song[^h7892], until they were ended[^h8552].

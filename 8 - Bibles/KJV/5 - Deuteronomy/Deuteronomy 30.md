###### 1
And it shall come to pass, when all these things[^h1697] are come[^h935] upon thee, the blessing[^h1293] and the curse[^h7045], which I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] thee, and thou shalt call[^h7725] them to mind[^h3824] among all the nations[^h1471], whither the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath driven[^h5080] thee,
###### 2
And shalt return[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and shalt obey[^h8085] his voice[^h6963] according to all that I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117], thou and thy children[^h1121], with all thine heart[^h3824], and with all thy soul[^h5315];
###### 3
That then the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will turn[^h7725] thy captivity[^h7622], and have compassion[^h7355] upon thee, and will return[^h7725] and gather[^h6908] thee from all the nations[^h5971], whither the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath scattered[^h6327] thee.
###### 4
If any of thine be driven out[^h5080] unto the outmost[^h7097] parts of heaven[^h8064], from thence will the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] gather[^h6908] thee, and from thence will he fetch[^h3947] thee:
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will bring[^h935] thee into the land[^h776] which thy fathers[^h1] possessed[^h3423], and thou shalt possess[^h3423] it; and he will do thee good[^h3190], and multiply[^h7235] thee above thy fathers[^h1].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will circumcise[^h4135] thine heart[^h3824], and the heart[^h3824] of thy seed[^h2233], to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] with all thine heart[^h3824], and with all thy soul[^h5315], that thou mayest live[^h2416].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will put[^h5414] all these curses[^h423] upon thine enemies[^h341], and on them that hate[^h8130] thee, which persecuted[^h7291] thee.
###### 8
And thou shalt return[^h7725] and obey[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], and do[^h6213] all his commandments[^h4687] which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] will make thee plenteous[^h3498] in every work[^h4639] of thine hand[^h3027], in the fruit[^h6529] of thy body[^h990], and in the fruit[^h6529] of thy cattle[^h929], and in the fruit[^h6529] of thy land[^h127], for good[^h2896]: for the LORD[^h3068] will again[^h7725] rejoice[^h7797] over thee for good[^h2896], as he rejoiced[^h7797] over thy fathers[^h1]:
###### 10
If thou shalt hearken[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687] and his statutes[^h2708] which are written[^h3789] in this book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451], and if thou turn[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] with all thine heart[^h3824], and with all thy soul[^h5315].
###### 11
For this commandment[^h4687] which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117], it is not hidden[^h6381] from thee, neither is it far off[^h7350].
###### 12
It is not in heaven[^h8064], that thou shouldest say[^h559], Who shall go up[^h5927] for us to heaven[^h8064], and bring[^h3947] it unto us, that we may hear[^h8085] it, and do[^h6213] it?
###### 13
Neither is it beyond[^h5676] the sea[^h3220], that thou shouldest say[^h559], Who shall go[^h5674] over[^h5676] the sea[^h3220] for us, and bring[^h3947] it unto us, that we may hear[^h8085] it, and do[^h6213] it?
###### 14
But the word[^h1697] is very[^h3966] nigh[^h7138] unto thee, in thy mouth[^h6310], and in thy heart[^h3824], that thou mayest do[^h6213] it.
###### 15
See[^h7200], I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] thee this day[^h3117] life[^h2416] and good[^h2896], and death[^h4194] and evil[^h7451];
###### 16
In that I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117] to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in his ways[^h1870], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687] and his statutes[^h2708] and his judgments[^h4941], that thou mayest live[^h2421] and multiply[^h7235]: and the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] shall bless[^h1288] thee in the land[^h776] whither thou goest[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 17
But if thine heart[^h3824] turn away[^h6437], so that thou wilt not hear[^h8085], but shalt be drawn away[^h5080], and worship[^h7812] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and serve[^h5647] them;
###### 18
I denounce[^h5046] unto you this day[^h3117], that ye shall surely[^h6] perish[^h6], and that ye shall not prolong[^h748] your days[^h3117] upon the land[^h127], whither thou passest over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to go[^h935] to possess[^h3423] it.
###### 19
I call[^h5749] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776] to record[^h5749] this day[^h3117] against you, that I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you life[^h2416] and death[^h4194], blessing[^h1293] and cursing[^h7045]: therefore choose[^h977] life[^h2416], that both thou and thy seed[^h2233] may live[^h2421]:
###### 20
That thou mayest love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and that thou mayest obey[^h8085] his voice[^h6963], and that thou mayest cleave[^h1692] unto him: for he is thy life[^h2416], and the length[^h753] of thy days[^h3117]: that thou mayest dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto thy fathers[^h1], to Abraham[^h85], to Isaac[^h3327], and to Jacob[^h3290], to give[^h5414] them.

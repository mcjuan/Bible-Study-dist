###### 1
And when the people[^h5971] saw[^h7200] that Moses[^h4872] delayed[^h954] to come down[^h3381] out of the mount[^h2022], the people[^h5971] gathered themselves together[^h6950] unto Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559] unto him, Up[^h6965], make[^h6213] us gods[^h430], which shall go[^h3212] before[^h6440] us; for as for this Moses[^h4872], the man[^h376] that brought[^h5927] us up out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], we wot[^h3045] not what is become of him.
###### 2
And Aaron[^h175] said[^h559] unto them, Break off[^h6561] the golden[^h2091] earrings[^h5141], which are in the ears[^h241] of your wives[^h802], of your sons[^h1121], and of your daughters[^h1323], and bring[^h935] them unto me.
###### 3
And all the people[^h5971] brake off[^h6561] the golden[^h2091] earrings[^h5141] which were in their ears[^h241], and brought[^h935] them unto Aaron[^h175].
###### 4
And he received[^h3947] them at their hand[^h3027], and fashioned[^h6696] it with a graving tool[^h2747], after he had made[^h6213] it a molten[^h4541] calf[^h5695]: and they said[^h559], These be thy gods[^h430], O Israel[^h3478], which brought[^h5927] thee up out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
And when Aaron[^h175] saw[^h7200] it, he built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] before[^h6440] it; and Aaron[^h175] made proclamation[^h7121], and said[^h559], To morrow[^h4279] is a feast[^h2282] to the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And they rose up early[^h7925] on the morrow[^h4283], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930], and brought[^h5066] peace offerings[^h8002]; and the people[^h5971] sat[^h3427] down to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354], and rose up[^h6965] to play[^h6711].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], Go[^h3212], get thee down[^h3381]; for thy people[^h5971], which thou broughtest[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], have corrupted[^h7843] themselves:
###### 8
They have turned[^h5493] aside quickly[^h4118] out of the way[^h1870] which I commanded[^h6680] them: they have made[^h6213] them a molten[^h4541] calf[^h5695], and have worshipped[^h7812] it, and have sacrificed[^h2076] thereunto, and said[^h559], These be thy gods[^h430], O Israel[^h3478], which have brought thee up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], I have seen[^h7200] this people[^h5971], and, behold, it is a stiffnecked[^h7186] [^h6203] people[^h5971]:
###### 10
Now therefore let me alone[^h3240], that my wrath[^h639] may wax hot[^h2734] against them, and that I may consume[^h3615] them: and I will make[^h6213] of thee a great[^h1419] nation[^h1471].
###### 11
And Moses[^h4872] besought[^h2470] [^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430], and said[^h559], LORD[^h3068], why doth thy wrath[^h639] wax hot[^h2734] against thy people[^h5971], which thou hast brought forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] with great[^h1419] power[^h3581], and with a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027]? 
###### 12
Wherefore should the Egyptians[^h4714] speak[^h559], and say[^h559], For mischief[^h7451] did he bring[^h3318] them out, to slay[^h2026] them in the mountains[^h2022], and to consume[^h3615] them from the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127]? Turn[^h7725] from thy fierce[^h2740] wrath[^h639], and repent[^h5162] of this evil[^h7451] against thy people[^h5971].
###### 13
Remember[^h2142] Abraham[^h85], Isaac[^h3327], and Israel[^h3478], thy servants[^h5650], to whom thou swarest[^h7650] by thine own self, and saidst[^h1696] unto them, I will multiply[^h7235] your seed[^h2233] as the stars[^h3556] of heaven[^h8064], and all this land[^h776] that I have spoken[^h559] of will I give[^h5414] unto your seed[^h2233], and they shall inherit[^h5157] it for ever[^h5769].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] repented[^h5162] of the evil[^h7451] which he thought[^h1696] to do[^h6213] unto his people[^h5971].
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] turned[^h6437], and went down[^h3381] from the mount[^h2022], and the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of the testimony[^h5715] were in his hand[^h3027]: the tables[^h3871] were written[^h3789] on both[^h8147] their sides[^h5676]; on the one side and on the other were they written[^h3789].
###### 16
And the tables[^h3871] were the work[^h4639] of God[^h430], and the writing[^h4385] was the writing[^h4385] of God[^h430], graven[^h2801] upon the tables[^h3871].
###### 17
And when Joshua[^h3091] heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of the people[^h5971] as they shouted[^h7452], he said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], There is a noise[^h6963] of war[^h4421] in the camp[^h4264].
###### 18
And he said[^h559], It is not the voice[^h6963] of them that shout[^h6030] for mastery[^h1369], neither is it the voice[^h6963] of them that cry[^h6030] for being overcome[^h2476]: but the noise[^h6963] of them that sing[^h6031] do I hear[^h8085]. 
###### 19
And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh[^h7126] unto the camp[^h4264], that he saw[^h7200] the calf[^h5695], and the dancing[^h4246]: and Moses'[^h4872] anger[^h639] waxed hot[^h2734], and he cast[^h7993] the tables[^h3871] out of his hands[^h3027], and brake[^h7665] them beneath[^h8478] the mount[^h2022].
###### 20
And he took[^h3947] the calf[^h5695] which they had made[^h6213], and burnt[^h8313] it in the fire[^h784], and ground[^h2912] it to powder[^h1854], and strawed[^h2219] it upon[^h6440] the water[^h4325], and made the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] drink[^h8248] of it.
###### 21
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], What did[^h6213] this people[^h5971] unto thee, that thou hast brought[^h935] so great[^h1419] a sin[^h2401] upon them?
###### 22
And Aaron[^h175] said[^h559], Let not the anger[^h639] of my lord[^h113] wax hot[^h2734]: thou knowest[^h3045] the people[^h5971], that they are set on mischief[^h7451].
###### 23
For they said[^h559] unto me, Make[^h6213] us gods[^h430], which shall go[^h3212] before[^h6440] us: for as for this Moses[^h4872], the man[^h376] that brought us up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], we wot[^h3045] not what is become of him.
###### 24
And I said[^h559] unto them, Whosoever hath any gold[^h2091], let them break[^h6561] it off. So they gave[^h5414] it me: then I cast[^h7993] it into the fire[^h784], and there came out[^h3318] this calf[^h5695].
###### 25
And when Moses[^h4872] saw[^h7200] that the people[^h5971] were naked[^h6544]; (for Aaron[^h175] had made them naked[^h6544] unto their shame[^h8103] among their enemies[^h6965]:) 
###### 26
Then Moses[^h4872] stood[^h5975] in the gate[^h8179] of the camp[^h4264], and said[^h559], Who is on the LORD'S[^h3068] side? let him come unto me. And all the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] gathered[^h622] themselves together unto him.
###### 27
And he said[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Put[^h7760] every man[^h376] his sword[^h2719] by his side[^h3409], and go[^h5674] in and out[^h7725] from gate[^h8179] to gate[^h8179] throughout the camp[^h4264], and slay[^h2026] every man[^h376] his brother[^h251], and every man[^h376] his companion[^h7453], and every man[^h376] his neighbour[^h7138].
###### 28
And the children[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878] did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Moses[^h4872]: and there fell[^h5307] of the people[^h5971] that day[^h3117] about three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men[^h376].
###### 29
For Moses[^h4872] had said[^h559], Consecrate yourselves[^h4390] [^h3027] to day[^h3117] to the LORD[^h3068], even[^h3588] every man[^h376] upon his son[^h1121], and upon his brother[^h251]; that he may bestow[^h5414] upon you a blessing[^h1293] this day[^h3117].  
###### 30
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Ye have sinned[^h2398] a great[^h1419] sin[^h2401]: and now I will go up[^h5927] unto the LORD[^h3068]; peradventure[^h194] I shall make an atonement[^h3722] for[^h1157] your sin[^h2403].
###### 31
And Moses[^h4872] returned[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Oh[^h577], this people[^h5971] have sinned[^h2398] a great[^h1419] sin[^h2401], and have made[^h6213] them gods[^h430] of gold[^h2091].
###### 32
Yet now, if thou wilt forgive[^h5375] their sin[^h2403]--; and if not, blot[^h4229] me, I pray thee, out of thy book[^h5612] which thou hast written[^h3789].
###### 33
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Whosoever[^h834] hath sinned[^h2398] against me, him will I blot out[^h4229] of my book[^h5612].
###### 34
Therefore now go[^h3212], lead[^h5148] the people[^h5971] unto the place of which I have spoken[^h1696] unto thee: behold, mine Angel[^h4397] shall go[^h3212] before[^h6440] thee: nevertheless in the day[^h3117] when I visit[^h6485] I will visit[^h6485] their sin[^h2403] upon them.
###### 35
And the LORD[^h3068] plagued[^h5062] the people[^h5971], because[^h834] they made[^h6213] the calf[^h5695], which[^h834] Aaron[^h175] made[^h6213].

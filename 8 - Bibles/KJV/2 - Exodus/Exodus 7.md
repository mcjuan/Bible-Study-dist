###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], See[^h7200], I have made[^h5414] thee a god[^h430] to Pharaoh[^h6547]: and Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251] shall be thy prophet[^h5030].
###### 2
Thou shalt speak[^h1696] all that I command[^h6680] thee: and Aaron[^h175] thy brother[^h251] shall speak[^h1696] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], that he send[^h7971] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of his land[^h776].
###### 3
And I will harden[^h7185] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], and multiply[^h7235] my signs[^h226] and my wonders[^h4159] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 4
But Pharaoh[^h6547] shall not hearken[^h8085] unto you, that I may lay[^h5414] my hand[^h3027] upon Egypt[^h4714], and bring forth[^h3318] mine armies[^h6635], and my people[^h5971] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] by great[^h1419] judgments[^h8201].
###### 5
And the Egyptians[^h4714] shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I stretch forth[^h5186] mine hand[^h3027] upon Egypt[^h4714], and bring out[^h3318] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] from among[^h8432] them.
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] them, so did[^h6213] they.
###### 7
And Moses[^h4872] was fourscore[^h8084] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], and Aaron[^h175] fourscore[^h8084] and three[^h7969] years[^h8141] old[^h1121], when they spake[^h1696] unto Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and unto Aaron[^h175], saying[^h559],
###### 9
When Pharaoh[^h6547] shall speak[^h1696] unto you, saying[^h559], Shew[^h5414] a miracle[^h4159] for you: then thou shalt say[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] thy rod[^h4294], and cast[^h7993] it before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547], and it shall become a serpent[^h8577].
###### 10
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went in[^h935] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and they did[^h6213] so as the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680]: and Aaron[^h175] cast down[^h7993] his rod[^h4294] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547], and before[^h6440] his servants[^h5650], and it became a serpent[^h8577].
###### 11
Then Pharaoh[^h6547] also called[^h7121] the wise men[^h2450] and the sorcerers[^h3784]: now the magicians[^h2748] of Egypt[^h4714], they also did[^h6213] in like manner[^h3651] with their enchantments[^h3858].
###### 12
For they cast down[^h7993] every man[^h376] his rod[^h4294], and they became serpents[^h8577]: but Aaron's[^h175] rod[^h4294] swallowed up[^h1104] their rods[^h4294].
###### 13
And he hardened[^h2388] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], that he hearkened[^h8085] not unto them; as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820] is hardened[^h3515], he refuseth[^h3985] to let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971].
###### 15
Get[^h3212] thee unto Pharaoh[^h6547] in the morning[^h1242]; lo, he goeth out[^h3318] unto the water[^h4325]; and thou shalt stand[^h5324] by the river's[^h2975] brink[^h8193] against he come[^h7125]; and the rod[^h4294] which was turned[^h2015] to a serpent[^h5175] shalt thou take[^h3947] in thine hand[^h3027].
###### 16
And thou shalt say[^h559] unto him, The LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of the Hebrews[^h5680] hath sent[^h7971] me unto thee, saying[^h559], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me in the wilderness[^h4057]: and, behold, hitherto[^h3541] thou wouldest not hear[^h8085].
###### 17
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], In this thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]: behold, I will smite[^h5221] with the rod[^h4294] that is in mine hand[^h3027] upon the waters[^h4325] which are in the river[^h2975], and they shall be turned[^h2015] to blood[^h1818].
###### 18
And the fish[^h1710] that is in the river[^h2975] shall die[^h4191], and the river[^h2975] shall stink[^h887]; and the Egyptians[^h4714] shall lothe[^h3811] to drink[^h8354] of the water[^h4325] of the river[^h2975].
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Say[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] thy rod[^h4294], and stretch out[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] upon the waters[^h4325] of Egypt[^h4714], upon their streams[^h5104], upon their rivers[^h2975], and upon their ponds[^h98], and upon all their pools[^h4723] of water[^h4325], that they may become blood[^h1818]; and that there may be blood[^h1818] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], both in vessels of wood[^h6086], and in vessels of stone[^h68]. 
###### 20
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] did[^h6213] so, as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680]; and he lifted up[^h7311] the rod[^h4294], and smote[^h5221] the waters[^h4325] that were in the river[^h2975], in the sight[^h5869] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and in the sight[^h5869] of his servants[^h5650]; and all the waters[^h4325] that were in the river[^h2975] were turned[^h2015] to blood[^h1818].
###### 21
And the fish[^h1710] that was in the river[^h2975] died[^h4191]; and the river[^h2975] stank[^h887], and the Egyptians[^h4714] could[^h3201] not drink[^h8354] of the water[^h4325] of the river[^h2975]; and there was blood[^h1818] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 22
And the magicians[^h2748] of Egypt[^h4714] did[^h6213] so with their enchantments[^h3909]: and Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820] was hardened[^h2388], neither did he hearken[^h8085] unto them; as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696].
###### 23
And Pharaoh[^h6547] turned[^h6437] and went[^h935] into his house[^h1004], neither did he set[^h7896] his heart[^h3820] to this[^h2063] also.
###### 24
And all the Egyptians[^h4714] digged[^h2658] round about[^h5439] the river[^h2975] for water[^h4325] to drink[^h8354]; for they could[^h3201] not drink[^h8354] of the water[^h4325] of the river[^h2975].
###### 25
And seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] were fulfilled[^h4390], after[^h310] that the LORD[^h3068] had smitten[^h5221] the river[^h2975].

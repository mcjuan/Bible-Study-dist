###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Hew[^h6458] thee two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68] like unto the first[^h7223]: and I will write[^h3789] upon these tables[^h3871] the words[^h1697] that were in the first[^h7223] tables[^h3871], which thou brakest[^h7665].
###### 2
And be ready[^h3559] in the morning[^h1242], and come up[^h5927] in the morning[^h1242] unto mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514], and present[^h5324] thyself there to me in the top[^h7218] of the mount[^h2022].
###### 3
And no man[^h376] shall come up[^h5927] with thee, neither[^h408] let any man[^h376] be seen[^h7200] throughout all the mount[^h2022]; neither let the flocks[^h6629] nor herds[^h1241] feed[^h7462] before[^h4136] that mount[^h2022].
###### 4
And he hewed[^h6458] two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68] like unto the first[^h7223]; and Moses[^h4872] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and went up[^h5927] unto mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514], as the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] him, and took[^h3947] in his hand[^h3027] the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] descended[^h3381] in the cloud[^h6051], and stood[^h3320] with him there, and proclaimed[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] passed by[^h5674] before him[^h6440], and proclaimed[^h7121], The LORD[^h3068], The LORD[^h3068] God[^h410], merciful[^h7349] and gracious[^h2587], longsuffering[^h750] [^h639], and abundant[^h7227] in goodness[^h2617] and truth[^h571],
###### 7
Keeping[^h5341] mercy[^h2617] for thousands[^h505], forgiving[^h5375] iniquity[^h5771] and transgression[^h6588] and sin[^h2403], and that will by no means[^h5352] clear[^h5352] the guilty; visiting[^h6485] the iniquity[^h5771] of the fathers[^h1] upon the children[^h1121], and upon the children's[^h1121] children, unto the third[^h8029] and to the fourth[^h7256] generation.
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] made haste[^h4116], and bowed his head[^h6915] toward the earth[^h776], and worshipped[^h7812].
###### 9
And he said[^h559], If now I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], O Lord[^h136], let my Lord[^h136], I pray thee, go[^h3212] among[^h7130] us; for it is a stiffnecked[^h7186] [^h6203] people[^h5971]; and pardon[^h5545] our iniquity[^h5771] and our sin[^h2403], and take us for thine inheritance[^h5157].
###### 10
And he said[^h559], Behold, I make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285]: before all thy people[^h5971] I will do[^h6213] marvels[^h6381], such as have not been done[^h1254] in all the earth[^h776], nor in any nation[^h1471]: and all the people[^h5971] among[^h7130] which thou art shall see[^h7200] the work[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068]: for it is a terrible thing[^h3372] that I will do[^h6213] with thee.
###### 11
Observe[^h8104] thou that which I command[^h6680] thee this day[^h3117]: behold, I drive out[^h1644] before[^h6440] thee the Amorite[^h567], and the Canaanite[^h3669], and the Hittite[^h2850], and the Perizzite[^h6522], and the Hivite[^h2340], and the Jebusite[^h2983].
###### 12
Take heed[^h8104] to thyself, lest thou make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] whither thou goest[^h935], lest it be for a snare[^h4170] in the midst[^h7130] of thee:
###### 13
But ye shall destroy[^h5422] their altars[^h4196], break[^h7665] their images[^h4676], and cut down[^h3772] their groves[^h842]: 
###### 14
For thou shalt worship[^h7812] no other[^h312] god[^h410]: for the LORD[^h3068], whose name[^h8034] is Jealous[^h7067], is a jealous[^h7067] God[^h410]:
###### 15
Lest thou make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776], and they go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] their gods[^h430], and do sacrifice[^h2076] unto their gods[^h430], and one call[^h7121] thee, and thou eat[^h398] of his sacrifice[^h2077];
###### 16
And thou take[^h3947] of their daughters[^h1323] unto thy sons[^h1121], and their daughters[^h1323] go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] their gods[^h430], and make[^h2181] thy sons[^h1121] go a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] their gods[^h430].
###### 17
Thou shalt make[^h6213] thee no molten[^h4541] gods[^h430].
###### 18
The feast[^h2282] of unleavened bread[^h4682] shalt thou keep[^h8104]. Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] thou shalt eat[^h398] unleavened bread[^h4682], as I commanded[^h6680] thee, in the time[^h4150] of the month[^h2320] Abib[^h24]: for in the month[^h2320] Abib[^h24] thou camest out[^h3318] from Egypt[^h4714].
###### 19
All that openeth[^h6363] the matrix[^h7358] is mine; and every firstling[^h6363] among thy cattle[^h4735], whether ox[^h7794] or sheep[^h7716], that is male[^h2142]. 
###### 20
But the firstling[^h6363] of an ass[^h2543] thou shalt redeem[^h6299] with a lamb[^h7716]: and if thou redeem[^h6299] him not, then shalt thou break his neck[^h6202]. All the firstborn[^h1060] of thy sons[^h1121] thou shalt redeem[^h6299]. And none shall appear[^h7200] before[^h6440] me empty[^h7387]. 
###### 21
Six[^h8337] days[^h3117] thou shalt work[^h5647], but on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] thou shalt rest[^h7673]: in earing time[^h2758] and in harvest[^h7105] thou shalt rest[^h7673].
###### 22
And thou shalt observe[^h6213] the feast[^h2282] of weeks[^h7620], of the firstfruits[^h1061] of wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105], and the feast[^h2282] of ingathering[^h614] at the year's[^h8141] end[^h8622]. 
###### 23
Thrice[^h6471] [^h7969] in the year[^h8141] shall all your men children[^h2138] appear[^h7200] before[^h6440] the Lord[^h113] GOD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
For I will cast out[^h3423] the nations[^h1471] before[^h6440] thee, and enlarge[^h7337] thy borders[^h1366]: neither shall any man[^h376] desire[^h2530] thy land[^h776], when thou shalt go up[^h5927] to appear[^h7200] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] thrice[^h6471] [^h7969] in the year[^h8141].
###### 25
Thou shalt not offer[^h7819] the blood[^h1818] of my sacrifice[^h2077] with leaven[^h2557]; neither shall the sacrifice[^h2077] of the feast[^h2282] of the passover[^h6453] be left[^h3885] unto the morning[^h1242].
###### 26
The first[^h7225] of the firstfruits[^h1061] of thy land[^h127] thou shalt bring[^h935] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]. Thou shalt not seethe[^h1310] a kid[^h1423] in his mother's[^h517] milk[^h2461].
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Write[^h3789] thou these words[^h1697]: for after the tenor[^h6310] of these words[^h1697] I have made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with thee and with Israel[^h3478].
###### 28
And he was there with the LORD[^h3068] forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915]; he did neither eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], nor drink[^h8354] water[^h4325]. And he wrote[^h3789] upon the tables[^h3871] the words[^h1697] of the covenant[^h1285], the ten[^h6235] commandments[^h1697]. 
###### 29
And it came to pass, when Moses[^h4872] came down[^h3381] from mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514] with the two[^h8147] tables[^h3871] of testimony[^h5715] in Moses'[^h4872] hand[^h3027], when he came down[^h3381] from the mount[^h2022], that Moses[^h4872] wist[^h3045] not that the skin[^h5785] of his face[^h6440] shone[^h7160] while he talked[^h1696] with him.
###### 30
And when Aaron[^h175] and all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] Moses[^h4872], behold, the skin[^h5785] of his face[^h6440] shone[^h7160]; and they were afraid[^h3372] to come nigh[^h5066] him.
###### 31
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] unto them; and Aaron[^h175] and all the rulers[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712] returned[^h7725] unto him: and Moses[^h4872] talked[^h1696] with them.
###### 32
And afterward[^h310] all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came nigh[^h5066]: and he gave them in commandment[^h6680] all that the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] with him in mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514].
###### 33
And till Moses[^h4872] had done[^h3615] speaking[^h1696] with them, he put[^h5414] a vail[^h4533] on his face[^h6440].
###### 34
But when Moses[^h4872] went in[^h935] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] to speak[^h1696] with him, he took[^h5493] the vail[^h4533] off[^h5493], until he came out[^h3318]. And he came out[^h3318], and spake[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] that which he was commanded[^h6680].
###### 35
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] the face[^h6440] of Moses[^h4872], that the skin[^h5785] of Moses'[^h4872] face[^h6440] shone[^h7160]: and Moses[^h4872] put[^h7725] the vail[^h4533] upon his face[^h6440] again[^h7725], until he went[^h935] in to speak[^h1696] with him.

###### 1
And they took their journey[^h5265] from Elim[^h362], and all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] unto the wilderness[^h4057] of Sin[^h5512], which is between Elim[^h362] and Sinai[^h5514], on the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the second[^h8145] month[^h2320] after their departing out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 2
And the whole congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] murmured[^h3885] against Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] in the wilderness[^h4057]:
###### 3
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto them, Would to God[^h4310] [^h5414] we had died[^h4191] by the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], when we sat[^h3427] by the flesh[^h1320] pots[^h5518], and when we did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] to the full[^h7648]; for ye have brought us forth[^h3318] into this wilderness[^h4057], to kill[^h4191] this whole assembly[^h6951] with hunger[^h7458].
###### 4
Then said[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] unto Moses[^h4872], Behold, I will rain[^h4305] bread[^h3899] from heaven[^h8064] for you; and the people[^h5971] shall go out[^h3318] and gather[^h3950] a certain rate[^h1697] every day[^h3117] [^h3117], that I may prove[^h5254] them, whether they will walk[^h3212] in my law[^h8451], or no. 
###### 5
And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth[^h8345] day[^h3117] they shall prepare[^h3559] that which[^h834] they bring in[^h935]; and it shall be twice[^h4932] as much as they gather[^h3950] daily[^h3117] [^h3117].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] said[^h559] unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], At even[^h6153], then ye shall know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] hath brought you out[^h3318] from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 7
And in the morning[^h1242], then ye shall see[^h7200] the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068]; for that he heareth[^h8085] your murmurings[^h8519] against the LORD[^h3068]: and what are we[^h5168], that ye murmur[^h3885] [^h3885] against us?
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], This shall be, when the LORD[^h3068] shall give[^h5414] you in the evening[^h6153] flesh[^h1320] to eat[^h398], and in the morning[^h1242] bread[^h3899] to the full[^h7646]; for that the LORD[^h3068] heareth[^h8085] your murmurings[^h8519] which ye murmur[^h3885] against him: and what are we[^h5168]? your murmurings[^h8519] are not against us, but against the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] spake[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Say[^h559] unto all the congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Come near[^h7126] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: for he hath heard[^h8085] your murmurings[^h8519].
###### 10
And it came to pass, as Aaron[^h175] spake[^h1696] unto the whole congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they looked[^h6437] toward the wilderness[^h4057], and, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] in the cloud[^h6051].
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 12
I have heard[^h8085] the murmurings[^h8519] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: speak[^h1696] unto them, saying[^h559], At even[^h996] [^h6153] ye shall eat[^h398] flesh[^h1320], and in the morning[^h1242] ye shall be filled[^h7646] with bread[^h3899]; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 13
And it came to pass, that at even[^h6153] the quails[^h7958] came up[^h5927], and covered[^h3680] the camp[^h4264]: and in the morning[^h1242] the dew[^h2919] lay[^h7902] round about[^h5439] the host[^h4264].
###### 14
And when the dew[^h2919] that lay[^h7902] was gone up[^h5927], behold, upon the face[^h6440] of the wilderness[^h4057] there lay a small[^h1851] round thing[^h2636], as small[^h1851] as the hoar frost[^h3713] on the ground[^h776].
###### 15
And when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] it, they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h251], It is manna[^h4478]: for they wist[^h3045] not what it was. And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto them, This is the bread[^h3899] which the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] you to eat[^h402]. 
###### 16
This is the thing[^h1697] which[^h834] the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680], Gather[^h3950] of it every man[^h376] according[^h6310] to his eating[^h400], an omer[^h6016] for every man[^h1538], according to the number[^h4557] of your persons[^h5315]; take[^h3947] ye every man[^h376] for them which are in his tents[^h168].  
###### 17
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] so, and gathered[^h3950], some more[^h7235], some less[^h4591].
###### 18
And when they did mete[^h4058] it with an omer[^h6016], he that gathered much[^h7235] had nothing over[^h5736], and he that gathered little[^h4591] had no lack[^h2637]; they gathered[^h3950] every man[^h376] according[^h6310] to his eating[^h400].
###### 19
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Let no man[^h376] leave[^h3498] of it till the morning[^h1242].
###### 20
Notwithstanding they hearkened[^h8085] not unto Moses[^h4872]; but some[^h582] of them left[^h3498] of it until the morning[^h1242], and it bred[^h7311] worms[^h8438], and stank[^h887]: and Moses[^h4872] was wroth[^h7107] with them.
###### 21
And they gathered[^h3950] it every morning[^h1242], every man[^h376] according[^h6310] to his eating[^h400]: and when the sun[^h8121] waxed hot[^h2552], it melted[^h4549].
###### 22
And it came to pass, that on the sixth[^h8345] day[^h3117] they gathered[^h3950] twice[^h4932] as much bread[^h3899], two[^h8147] omers[^h6016] for one[^h259] man: and all the rulers[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712] came[^h935] and told[^h5046] Moses[^h4872].
###### 23
And he said[^h559] unto them, This is that which the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696], To morrow[^h4279] is the rest[^h7677] of the holy[^h6944] sabbath[^h7676] unto the LORD[^h3068]: bake[^h644] that which ye will bake[^h644] to day, and seethe[^h1310] that ye will seethe[^h1310]; and that which[^h3605] remaineth over[^h5736] lay up[^h3240] for you to be kept[^h4931] until the morning[^h1242].
###### 24
And they laid it up[^h3240] till the morning[^h1242], as Moses[^h4872] bade[^h6680]: and it did not stink[^h887], neither was there any worm[^h7415] therein.
###### 25
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Eat[^h398] that to day[^h3117]; for to day[^h3117] is a sabbath[^h7676] unto the LORD[^h3068]: to day[^h3117] ye shall not find[^h4672] it in the field[^h7704].
###### 26
Six[^h8337] days[^h3117] ye shall gather[^h3950] it; but on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], which is the sabbath[^h7676], in it there shall be none.
###### 27
And it came to pass, that there went out[^h3318] some of the people[^h5971] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] for to gather[^h3950], and they found[^h4672] none.
###### 28
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], How long refuse[^h3985] ye to keep[^h8104] my commandments[^h4687] and my laws[^h8451]?
###### 29
See[^h7200], for that the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] you the sabbath[^h7676], therefore he giveth[^h5414] you on the sixth[^h8345] day[^h3117] the bread[^h3899] of two days[^h3117]; abide[^h3427] ye every man[^h376] in his place, let no man[^h376] go out[^h3318] of his place[^h4725] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117].
###### 30
So the people[^h5971] rested[^h7673] on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117].
###### 31
And the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] thereof Manna[^h4478]: and it was like coriander[^h1407] seed[^h2233], white[^h3836]; and the taste[^h2940] of it was like wafers[^h6838] made with honey[^h1706].
###### 32
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], This is the thing[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] commandeth[^h6680], Fill[^h4393] an omer[^h6016] of it to be kept[^h4931] for your generations[^h1755]; that they may see[^h7200] the bread[^h3899] wherewith I have fed[^h398] you in the wilderness[^h4057], when I brought you forth[^h3318] from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 33
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] a[^h259] pot[^h6803], and put[^h5414] an omer[^h6016] full[^h4393] of manna[^h4478] therein, and lay it up[^h3240] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to be kept[^h4931] for your generations[^h1755].
###### 34
As the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872], so Aaron[^h175] laid it up[^h3240] before[^h6440] the Testimony[^h5715], to be kept[^h4931].
###### 35
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did eat[^h398] manna[^h4478] forty[^h705] years[^h8141], until they came[^h935] to a land[^h776] inhabited[^h3427]; they did eat[^h398] manna[^h4478], until they came[^h935] unto the borders[^h7097] of the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667].
###### 36
Now an omer[^h6016] is the tenth[^h6224] part of an ephah[^h374].

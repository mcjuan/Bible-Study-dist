And I have filled[^h4390] him with the spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430], in wisdom[^h2451], and in understanding[^h8394], and in knowledge[^h1847], and in all manner of workmanship[^h4399],

###### 7
The tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and the ark[^h727] of the testimony[^h5715], and the mercy seat[^h3727] that is thereupon, and all the furniture[^h3627] of the tabernacle[^h168],

And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 13
Speak[^h1696] thou also unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Verily[^h389] my sabbaths[^h7676] ye shall keep[^h8104]: for it is a sign[^h226] between me and you throughout your generations[^h1755]; that ye may know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] that doth sanctify[^h6942] you.
###### 14
Ye shall keep[^h8104] the sabbath[^h7676] therefore; for it is holy[^h6944] unto you: every one that defileth[^h2490] it shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]: for whosoever doeth[^h6213] any work[^h4399] therein, that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from among[^h7130] his people[^h5971].

###### 16
Wherefore the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall keep[^h8104] the sabbath[^h7676], to observe[^h6213] the sabbath[^h7676] throughout their generations[^h1755], for a perpetual[^h5769] covenant[^h1285].
###### 17
It is a sign[^h226] between me and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769]: for in six[^h8337] days[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] made[^h6213] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776], and on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] he rested[^h7673], and was refreshed[^h5314].

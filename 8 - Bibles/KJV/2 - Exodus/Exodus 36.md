###### 1
Then wrought[^h6213] Bezaleel[^h1212] and Aholiab[^h171], and every wise[^h2450] hearted[^h3820] man[^h376], in whom[^h1992] the LORD[^h3068] put[^h5414] wisdom[^h2451] and understanding[^h8394] to know[^h3045] how to work[^h6213] all manner of work[^h4399] for the service[^h5656] of the sanctuary[^h6944], according to all that the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680].
###### 2
And Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] Bezaleel[^h1212] and Aholiab[^h171], and every wise[^h2450] hearted[^h3820] man[^h376], in whose heart[^h3820] the LORD[^h3068] had put[^h5414] wisdom[^h2451], even every one whose heart[^h3820] stirred him up[^h5375] to come[^h7126] unto the work[^h4399] to do[^h6213] it:
###### 3
And they received[^h3947] of[^h6440] Moses[^h4872] all the offering[^h8641], which the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] had brought[^h935] for the work[^h4399] of the service[^h5656] of the sanctuary[^h6944], to make[^h6213] it withal. And they brought[^h935] yet unto him free offerings[^h5071] every morning[^h1242].
###### 4
And all the wise men[^h2450], that wrought[^h6213] all the work[^h4399] of the sanctuary[^h6944], came[^h935] every man[^h376] from his work[^h4399] which they made[^h6213];
###### 5
And they spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559], The people[^h5971] bring[^h935] much more[^h7235] than enough[^h1767] for the service[^h5656] of the work[^h4399], which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] to make[^h6213].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] gave commandment[^h6680], and they caused it to be proclaimed[^h6963] [^h5674] throughout the camp[^h4264], saying[^h559], Let neither man[^h376] nor woman[^h802] make[^h6213] any more work[^h4399] for the offering[^h8641] of the sanctuary[^h6944]. So the people[^h5971] were restrained[^h3607] from bringing[^h935].
###### 7
For the stuff[^h4399] they had was sufficient[^h1767] for all the work[^h4399] to make[^h6213] it, and too much[^h3498].
###### 8
And every wise[^h2450] hearted man[^h3820] among them that wrought[^h6213] the work[^h4399] of the tabernacle[^h4908] made[^h6213] ten[^h6235] curtains[^h3407] of fine twined[^h7806] linen[^h8336], and blue[^h8504], and purple[^h713], and scarlet[^h8144] [^h8438]: with cherubims[^h3742] of cunning[^h2803] work[^h4639] made[^h6213] he them.

###### 10
And he coupled[^h2266] the five[^h2568] curtains[^h3407] one[^h259] unto another[^h259]: and the other five[^h2568] curtains[^h3407] he coupled[^h2266] one[^h259] unto another[^h259].
###### 11
And he made[^h6213] loops[^h3924] of blue[^h8504] on the edge[^h8193] of one[^h259] curtain[^h3407] from the selvedge[^h7098] in the coupling[^h4225]: likewise he made[^h6213] in the uttermost[^h7020] side[^h8193] of another curtain[^h3407], in the coupling[^h4225] of the second[^h8145].

###### 13
And he made[^h6213] fifty[^h2572] taches[^h7165] of gold[^h2091], and coupled[^h2266] the curtains[^h3407] one[^h259] unto another[^h259] with the taches[^h7165]: so it became one[^h259] tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 14
And he made[^h6213] curtains[^h3407] of goats'[^h5795] hair for the tent[^h168] over the tabernacle[^h4908]: eleven[^h6249] [^h6240] curtains[^h3407] he made[^h6213] them.
###### 15
The length[^h753] of one[^h259] curtain[^h3407] was thirty[^h7970] cubits[^h520], and four[^h702] cubits[^h520] was the breadth[^h7341] of one[^h259] curtain[^h3407]: the eleven[^h6249] [^h6240] curtains[^h3407] were of one[^h259] size[^h4060].

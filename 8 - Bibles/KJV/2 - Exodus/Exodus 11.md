###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Yet will I bring[^h935] one[^h259] plague[^h5061] more upon Pharaoh[^h6547], and upon Egypt[^h4714]; afterwards[^h310] he will let you go[^h7971] hence: when he shall let you go[^h7971], he shall surely[^h1644] thrust you out[^h1644] hence altogether[^h3617].
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] now in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971], and let every man[^h376] borrow[^h7592] of his neighbour[^h7453], and every woman[^h802] of her neighbour[^h7468], jewels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], and jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091].
###### 3
And the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] the people[^h5971] favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of the Egyptians[^h4714]. Moreover the man[^h376] Moses[^h4872] was very[^h3966] great[^h1419] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in the sight[^h5869] of Pharaoh's[^h6547] servants[^h5650], and in the sight[^h5869] of the people[^h5971].
###### 4
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], About midnight[^h3915] [^h2676] will I go out[^h3318] into the midst[^h8432] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 5
And all the firstborn[^h1060] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] shall die[^h4191], from the firstborn[^h1060] of Pharaoh[^h6547] that sitteth[^h3427] upon his throne[^h3678], even unto the firstborn[^h1060] of the maidservant[^h8198] that is behind[^h310] the mill[^h7347]; and all the firstborn[^h1060] of beasts[^h929].
###### 6
And there shall be[^h1961] a great[^h1419] cry[^h6818] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], such as there was none[^h3808] like it, nor[^h3808] shall be like it any more[^h3254].
###### 7
But against any of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall not a dog[^h3611] move[^h2782] his tongue[^h3956], against man[^h376] or beast[^h929]: that ye may know[^h3045] how that the LORD[^h3068] doth put a difference[^h6395] between the Egyptians[^h4714] and Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
And all these thy servants[^h5650] shall come down[^h3381] unto me, and bow down[^h7812] themselves unto me, saying[^h559], Get thee out[^h3318], and all the people[^h5971] that follow[^h7272] thee: and after[^h310] that I will go out[^h3318]. And he went out[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547] in a great[^h2750] anger[^h639].  
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Pharaoh[^h6547] shall not hearken[^h8085] unto you; that my wonders[^h4159] may be multiplied[^h7235] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 10
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] did[^h6213] all these wonders[^h4159] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547]: and the LORD[^h3068] hardened[^h2388] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], so that he would not let the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] go out[^h7971] of his land[^h776].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they turn[^h7725] and encamp[^h2583] before[^h6440] Pihahiroth[^h6367], between Migdol[^h4024] and the sea[^h3220], over against[^h6440] Baalzephon[^h1189]: before[^h5226] it shall ye encamp[^h2583] by the sea[^h3220].
###### 3
For Pharaoh[^h6547] will say[^h559] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], They are entangled[^h943] in the land[^h776], the wilderness[^h4057] hath shut them in[^h5462].
###### 4
And I will harden[^h2388] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], that he shall follow[^h7291] after[^h310] them; and I will be honoured[^h3513] upon Pharaoh[^h6547], and upon all his host[^h2428]; that the Egyptians[^h4714] may know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]. And they did[^h6213] so.
###### 5
And it was told[^h5046] the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] that the people[^h5971] fled[^h1272]: and the heart[^h3824] of Pharaoh[^h6547] and of his servants[^h5650] was turned[^h2015] against the people[^h5971], and they said[^h559], Why have we done[^h6213] this, that we have let Israel[^h3478] go[^h7971] from serving[^h5647] us?
###### 6
And he made ready[^h631] his chariot[^h7393], and took[^h3947] his people[^h5971] with him:
###### 7
And he took[^h3947] six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] chosen[^h977] chariots[^h7393], and all the chariots[^h7393] of Egypt[^h4714], and captains[^h7991] over every one of them.
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] hardened[^h2388] the heart[^h3820] of Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and he pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318] with an high[^h7311] hand[^h3027].
###### 9
But the Egyptians[^h4714] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] them, all the horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h7393] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and his horsemen[^h6571], and his army[^h2428], and overtook[^h5381] them encamping[^h2583] by the sea[^h3220], beside Pihahiroth[^h6367], before[^h6440] Baalzephon[^h1189].
###### 10
And when Pharaoh[^h6547] drew nigh[^h7126], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] lifted up[^h5375] their eyes[^h5869], and, behold, the Egyptians[^h4714] marched[^h5265] after[^h310] them; and they were sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried out[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
And they said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Because there were no graves[^h6913] in Egypt[^h4714], hast thou taken us away[^h3947] to die[^h4191] in the wilderness[^h4057]? wherefore[^h2063] hast thou dealt[^h6213] thus with us, to carry us forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]?
###### 12
Is not this the word[^h1697] that we did tell[^h1696] thee in Egypt[^h4714], saying[^h559], Let us alone[^h2308], that we may serve[^h5647] the Egyptians[^h4714]? For it had been better[^h2896] for us to serve[^h5647] the Egyptians[^h4714], than that we should die[^h4191] in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Fear[^h3372] ye not, stand still[^h3320], and see[^h7200] the salvation[^h3444] of the LORD[^h3068], which he will shew[^h6213] to you to day[^h3117]: for the Egyptians[^h4714] whom ye have seen[^h7200] to day[^h3117], ye shall see[^h7200] them again[^h3254] no more for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]. 
###### 14
The LORD[^h3068] shall fight[^h3898] for you, and ye shall hold your peace[^h2790].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Wherefore criest[^h6817] thou unto me? speak[^h1696] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they go forward[^h5265]:
###### 16
But lift thou up[^h7311] thy rod[^h4294], and stretch out[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] over the sea[^h3220], and divide[^h1234] it: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall go[^h935] on dry[^h3004] ground through the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220].
###### 17
And I, behold, I will harden[^h2388] the hearts[^h3820] of the Egyptians[^h4714], and they shall follow[^h935] them[^h310]: and I will get me honour[^h3513] upon Pharaoh[^h6547], and upon all his host[^h2428], upon his chariots[^h7393], and upon his horsemen[^h6571].
###### 18
And the Egyptians[^h4714] shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I have gotten me honour[^h3513] upon Pharaoh[^h6547], upon his chariots[^h7393], and upon his horsemen[^h6571].
###### 19
And the angel[^h4397] of God[^h430], which went[^h1980] before[^h6440] the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478], removed[^h5265] and went[^h3212] behind[^h310] them; and the pillar[^h5982] of the cloud[^h6051] went[^h5265] from before their face[^h6440], and stood[^h5975] behind[^h310] them:
###### 20
And it came[^h935] between the camp[^h4264] of the Egyptians[^h4714] and the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478]; and it was a cloud[^h6051] and darkness[^h2822] to them, but it gave light[^h215] by night[^h3915] to these: so that the one came not near[^h7126] the other[^h2088] all the night[^h3915].
###### 21
And Moses[^h4872] stretched out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] over the sea[^h3220]; and the LORD[^h3068] caused the sea[^h3220] to go[^h3212] back by a strong[^h5794] east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] all that night[^h3915], and made[^h7760] the sea[^h3220] dry[^h2724] land, and the waters[^h4325] were divided[^h1234].
###### 22
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h935] into the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220] upon the dry[^h3004] ground: and the waters[^h4325] were a wall[^h2346] unto them on their right hand[^h3225], and on their left[^h8040].
###### 23
And the Egyptians[^h4714] pursued[^h7291], and went in[^h935] after[^h310] them to the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220], even all Pharaoh's[^h6547] horses[^h5483], his chariots[^h7393], and his horsemen[^h6571].
###### 24
And it came to pass, that in the morning[^h1242] watch[^h821] the LORD[^h3068] looked[^h8259] unto the host[^h4264] of the Egyptians[^h4714] through the pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784] and of the cloud[^h6051], and troubled[^h2000] the host[^h4264] of the Egyptians[^h4714],
###### 25
And took off[^h5493] their chariot[^h4818] wheels[^h212], that they drave[^h5090] them heavily[^h3517]: so that the Egyptians[^h4714] said[^h559], Let us flee[^h5127] from the face[^h6440] of Israel[^h3478]; for the LORD[^h3068] fighteth[^h3898] for them against the Egyptians[^h4714]. 
###### 26
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Stretch out[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] over the sea[^h3220], that the waters[^h4325] may come again[^h7725] upon the Egyptians[^h4714], upon their chariots[^h7393], and upon their horsemen[^h6571].
###### 27
And Moses[^h4872] stretched forth[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] over the sea[^h3220], and the sea[^h3220] returned[^h7725] to his strength[^h386] when the morning[^h1242] appeared[^h6437]; and the Egyptians[^h4714] fled[^h5127] against[^h7125] it; and the LORD[^h3068] overthrew[^h5287] the Egyptians[^h4714] in the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220]. 
###### 28
And the waters[^h4325] returned[^h7725], and covered[^h3680] the chariots[^h7393], and the horsemen[^h6571], and all the host[^h2428] of Pharaoh[^h6547] that came[^h935] into the sea[^h3220] after[^h310] them; there remained[^h7604] not so much as[^h5704] one[^h259] of them.
###### 29
But the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] walked[^h1980] upon dry[^h3004] land in the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220]; and the waters[^h4325] were a wall[^h2346] unto them on their right hand[^h3225], and on their left[^h8040].
###### 30
Thus the LORD[^h3068] saved[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] that day[^h3117] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714]; and Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] the Egyptians[^h4714] dead[^h4191] upon the sea[^h3220] shore[^h8193].
###### 31
And Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that great[^h1419] work[^h3027] which the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] upon the Egyptians[^h4714]: and the people[^h5971] feared[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068], and believed[^h539] the LORD[^h3068], and his servant[^h5650] Moses[^h4872].

###### 1
Then the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Go[^h935] in unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and tell[^h1696] him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of the Hebrews[^h5680], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me.
###### 2
For if thou refuse[^h3986] to let them go[^h7971], and wilt hold[^h2388] them still,
###### 3
Behold, the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] is[^h1961] upon thy cattle[^h4735] which is in the field[^h7704], upon the horses[^h5483], upon the asses[^h2543], upon the camels[^h1581], upon the oxen[^h1241], and upon the sheep[^h6629]: there shall be a very[^h3966] grievous[^h3515] murrain[^h1698].
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] shall sever[^h6395] between the cattle[^h4735] of Israel[^h3478] and the cattle[^h4735] of Egypt[^h4714]: and there shall nothing[^h1697] die[^h4191] of all that is the children's[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] appointed[^h7760] a set time[^h4150], saying[^h559], To morrow[^h4279] the LORD[^h3068] shall do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] in the land[^h776].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] that thing[^h1697] on the morrow[^h4283], and all the cattle[^h4735] of Egypt[^h4714] died[^h4191]: but of the cattle[^h4735] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] died[^h4191] not one[^h259].
###### 7
And Pharaoh[^h6547] sent[^h7971], and, behold, there was not one[^h259] of the cattle[^h4735] of the Israelites[^h3478] dead[^h4191]. And the heart[^h3820] of Pharaoh[^h6547] was hardened[^h3513], and he did not let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and unto Aaron[^h175], Take[^h3947] to you handfuls[^h2651] [^h4393] of ashes[^h6368] of the furnace[^h3536], and let Moses[^h4872] sprinkle[^h2236] it toward the heaven[^h8064] in the sight[^h5869] of Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 9
And it shall become small dust[^h80] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and shall be a boil[^h7822] breaking forth[^h6524] with blains[^h76] upon man[^h120], and upon beast[^h929], throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 10
And they took[^h3947] ashes[^h6368] of the furnace[^h3536], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547]; and Moses[^h4872] sprinkled[^h2236] it up toward heaven[^h8064]; and it became a boil[^h7822] breaking forth[^h6524] with blains[^h76] upon man[^h120], and upon beast[^h929].
###### 11
And the magicians[^h2748] could[^h3201] not stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] Moses[^h4872] because[^h6440] of the boils[^h7822]; for the boil[^h7822] was upon the magicians[^h2748], and upon all the Egyptians[^h4714].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] hardened[^h2388] the heart[^h3820] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and he hearkened[^h8085] not unto them; as the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872].
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Rise up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and stand[^h3320] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547], and say[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of the Hebrews[^h5680], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me.
###### 14
For I will at this time[^h6471] send[^h7971] all my plagues[^h4046] upon thine heart[^h3820], and upon thy servants[^h5650], and upon thy people[^h5971]; that thou mayest know[^h3045] that there is none like me in all the earth[^h776].
###### 15
For now I will stretch out[^h7971] my hand[^h3027], that I may smite[^h5221] thee and thy people[^h5971] with pestilence[^h1698]; and thou shalt be cut off[^h3582] from the earth[^h776].
###### 16
And in very[^h199] deed[^h5668] for this cause have I raised thee up[^h5975], for to shew[^h7200] in thee my power[^h3581]; and that my name[^h8034] may be declared[^h5608] throughout all the earth[^h776]. 
###### 17
As yet exaltest[^h5549] thou thyself against my people[^h5971], that thou wilt not let them go[^h7971]?
###### 18
Behold, to morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256] I will cause it to rain[^h4305] a very[^h3966] grievous[^h3515] hail[^h1259], such as hath not been[^h3644] in Egypt[^h4714] since[^h4480] the foundation[^h3117] [^h3245] thereof even until now.
###### 19
Send[^h7971] therefore now, and gather[^h5756] thy cattle[^h4735], and all that thou hast in the field[^h7704]; for upon every man[^h120] and beast[^h929] which shall be found[^h4672] in the field[^h7704], and shall not be brought[^h622] home[^h1004], the hail[^h1259] shall come down[^h3381] upon them, and they shall die[^h4191].
###### 20
He that feared[^h3373] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] among the servants[^h5650] of Pharaoh[^h6547] made his servants[^h5650] and his cattle[^h4735] flee[^h5127] into the houses[^h1004]:
###### 21
And he that regarded[^h7760] [^h3820] not the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] left[^h5800] his servants[^h5650] and his cattle[^h4735] in the field[^h7704]. 
###### 22
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Stretch forth[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] toward heaven[^h8064], that there may be hail[^h1259] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], upon man[^h120], and upon beast[^h929], and upon every herb[^h6212] of the field[^h7704], throughout the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 23
And Moses[^h4872] stretched forth[^h5186] his rod[^h4294] toward heaven[^h8064]: and the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h5414] thunder[^h6963] and hail[^h1259], and the fire[^h784] ran along[^h1980] upon the ground[^h776]; and the LORD[^h3068] rained[^h4305] hail[^h1259] upon the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 24
So there was hail[^h1259], and fire[^h784] [^h3947] mingled[^h8432] with the hail[^h1259], very[^h3966] grievous[^h3515], such as there was none[^h3808] like it in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] since it became a nation[^h1471].
###### 25
And the hail[^h1259] smote[^h5221] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] all that was in the field[^h7704], both man[^h120] and beast[^h929]; and the hail[^h1259] smote[^h5221] every herb[^h6212] of the field[^h7704], and brake[^h7665] every tree[^h6086] of the field[^h7704].
###### 26
Only in the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657], where the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were, was there no hail[^h1259].
###### 27
And Pharaoh[^h6547] sent[^h7971], and called[^h7121] for Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559] unto them, I have sinned[^h2398] this time[^h6471]: the LORD[^h3068] is righteous[^h6662], and I and my people[^h5971] are wicked[^h7563].
###### 28
Intreat[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068] (for it is enough[^h7227]) that there be no more mighty[^h430] thunderings[^h6963] and hail[^h1259]; and I will let you go[^h7971], and ye shall stay[^h5975] no longer[^h3254]. 
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto him, As soon as I am gone out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892], I will spread abroad[^h6566] my hands[^h3709] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and the thunder[^h6963] shall cease[^h2308], neither shall there be any more hail[^h1259]; that thou mayest know[^h3045] how that the earth[^h776] is the LORD'S[^h3068].
###### 30
But as for thee and thy servants[^h5650], I know[^h3045] that ye will not yet fear[^h3372] [^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430].
###### 31
And the flax[^h6594] and the barley[^h8184] was smitten[^h5221]: for the barley[^h8184] was in the ear[^h24], and the flax[^h6594] was bolled[^h1392].
###### 32
But the wheat[^h2406] and the rie[^h3698] were not smitten[^h5221]: for they[^h2007] were not grown up[^h648]. 
###### 33
And Moses[^h4872] went out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892] from Pharaoh[^h6547], and spread abroad[^h6566] his hands[^h3709] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and the thunders[^h6963] and hail[^h1259] ceased[^h2308], and the rain[^h4306] was not poured[^h5413] upon the earth[^h776].
###### 34
And when Pharaoh[^h6547] saw[^h7200] that the rain[^h4306] and the hail[^h1259] and the thunders[^h6963] were ceased[^h2308], he sinned[^h2398] yet more[^h3254], and hardened[^h3513] his heart[^h3820], he and his servants[^h5650].
###### 35
And the heart[^h3820] of Pharaoh[^h6547] was hardened[^h2388], neither would he let the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] go[^h7971]; as the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] by[^h3027] Moses[^h4872].

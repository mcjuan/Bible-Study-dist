###### 1
And afterward[^h310] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went in[^h935], and told[^h559] Pharaoh[^h6547], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may hold a feast[^h2287] unto me in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 2
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559], Who is the LORD[^h3068], that I should obey[^h8085] his voice[^h6963] to let Israel[^h3478] go[^h7971]? I know[^h3045] not the LORD[^h3068], neither will I let Israel[^h3478] go[^h7971].
###### 3
And they said[^h559], The God[^h430] of the Hebrews[^h5680] hath met[^h7122] with us: let us go[^h3212], we pray thee, three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870] into the desert[^h4057], and sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]; lest he fall[^h6293] upon us with pestilence[^h1698], or with the sword[^h2719].
###### 4
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] said[^h559] unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], let[^h6544] the people[^h5971] from their works[^h4639]? get[^h3212] you unto your burdens[^h5450].
###### 5
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559], Behold, the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] now are many[^h7227], and ye make them rest[^h7673] from their burdens[^h5450].
###### 6
And Pharaoh[^h6547] commanded[^h6680] the same day[^h3117] the taskmasters[^h5065] of the people[^h5971], and their officers[^h7860], saying[^h559],
###### 7
Ye shall no more[^h3254] give[^h5414] the people[^h5971] straw[^h8401] to make[^h3835] brick[^h3843], as heretofore[^h8032] [^h8543]: let them go[^h3212] and gather[^h7197] straw[^h8401] for themselves.
###### 8
And the tale[^h4971] of the bricks[^h3843], which they did make[^h6213] heretofore[^h8032] [^h8543], ye shall lay[^h7760] upon them; ye shall not diminish[^h1639] ought thereof: for they be idle[^h7503]; therefore they cry[^h6817], saying[^h559], Let us go[^h3212] and sacrifice[^h2076] to our God[^h430].
###### 9
Let there more work[^h5656] be laid[^h3513] upon the men[^h582], that they may labour[^h6213] therein; and let them not regard[^h8159] vain[^h8267] words[^h1697]. 
###### 10
And the taskmasters[^h5065] of the people[^h5971] went out[^h3318], and their officers[^h7860], and they spake[^h559] to the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] Pharaoh[^h6547], I will not give[^h5414] you straw[^h8401].
###### 11
Go[^h3212] ye, get[^h3947] you straw[^h8401] where[^h834] ye can find[^h4672] it: yet[^h3588] not ought[^h1697] of your work[^h5656] shall be diminished[^h1639].
###### 12
So the people[^h5971] were scattered abroad[^h6327] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] to gather[^h7197] stubble[^h7179] instead of straw[^h8401].
###### 13
And the taskmasters[^h5065] hasted[^h213] them, saying[^h559], Fulfil[^h3615] your works[^h4639], your daily[^h3117] tasks[^h1697], as when there was[^h1961] straw[^h8401]. 
###### 14
And the officers[^h7860] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which Pharaoh's[^h6547] taskmasters[^h5065] had set[^h7760] over them, were beaten[^h5221], and demanded[^h559], Wherefore have ye not fulfilled[^h3615] your task[^h2706] in making brick[^h3835] both yesterday[^h8543] and to day[^h3117], as heretofore[^h8032] [^h8543]?
###### 15
Then the officers[^h7860] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] and cried[^h6817] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], saying[^h559], Wherefore dealest[^h6213] thou thus with thy servants[^h5650]?
###### 16
There is no straw[^h8401] given[^h5414] unto thy servants[^h5650], and they say[^h559] to us, Make[^h6213] brick[^h3843]: and, behold, thy servants[^h5650] are beaten[^h5221]; but the fault[^h2398] is in thine own people[^h5971].
###### 17
But he said[^h559], Ye are idle[^h7503], ye are idle[^h7503]: therefore ye say[^h559], Let us go[^h3212] and do sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
Go[^h3212] therefore now, and work[^h5647]; for there shall no straw[^h8401] be given[^h5414] you, yet shall ye deliver[^h5414] the tale[^h8506] of bricks[^h3843].
###### 19
And the officers[^h7860] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did see[^h7200] that they were in evil[^h7451] case, after it was said[^h559], Ye shall not minish[^h1639] ought from your bricks[^h3843] of your daily[^h3117] [^h3117] task[^h1697].
###### 20
And they met[^h6293] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], who stood[^h5324] in the way[^h7125], as they came forth[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547]:
###### 21
And they said[^h559] unto them, The LORD[^h3068] look[^h7200] upon you, and judge[^h8199]; because ye have made our savour[^h7381] to be abhorred[^h887] in the eyes[^h5869] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and in the eyes[^h5869] of his servants[^h5650], to put[^h5414] a sword[^h2719] in their hand[^h3027] to slay[^h2026] us. 
###### 22
And Moses[^h4872] returned[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Lord[^h136], wherefore hast thou so evil entreated[^h7489] this people[^h5971]? why is it that thou hast sent[^h7971] me?
###### 23
For since I came[^h935] to Pharaoh[^h6547] to speak[^h1696] in thy name[^h8034], he hath done evil[^h7489] to this people[^h5971]; neither hast thou delivered[^h5337] thy people[^h5971] at all[^h5337].

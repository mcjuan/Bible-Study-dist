###### 1
Now these are the judgments[^h4941] which thou shalt set[^h7760] before[^h6440] them.
###### 2
If thou buy[^h7069] an Hebrew[^h5680] servant[^h5650], six[^h8337] years[^h8141] he shall serve[^h5647]: and in the seventh[^h7637] he shall go out[^h3318] free[^h2670] for nothing[^h2600].
###### 3
If he came in[^h935] by himself[^h1610], he shall go out[^h3318] by himself[^h1610]: if he were married[^h1167] [^h802], then his wife[^h802] shall go out[^h3318] with him. 
###### 4
If his master[^h113] have given[^h5414] him a wife[^h802], and she have born[^h3205] him sons[^h1121] or daughters[^h1323]; the wife[^h802] and her children[^h3206] shall be her master's[^h113], and he shall go out[^h3318] by himself[^h1610].
###### 5
And if the servant[^h5650] shall plainly[^h559] say[^h559], I love[^h157] my master[^h113], my wife[^h802], and my children[^h1121]; I will not go out[^h3318] free[^h2670]: 
###### 6
Then his master[^h113] shall bring[^h5066] him unto the judges[^h430]; he shall also bring[^h5066] him to the door[^h1817], or unto the door post[^h4201]; and his master[^h113] shall bore[^h7527] his ear[^h241] through with an aul[^h4836]; and he shall serve[^h5647] him for ever[^h5769].
###### 7
And if a man[^h376] sell[^h4376] his daughter[^h1323] to be a maidservant[^h519], she shall not go out[^h3318] as the menservants[^h5650] do[^h3318].
###### 8
If she please[^h7451] [^h5869] not her master[^h113], who hath betrothed[^h3259] her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed[^h6299]: to sell[^h4376] her unto a strange[^h5237] nation[^h5971] he shall have no power[^h4910], seeing he hath dealt deceitfully[^h898] with her. 
###### 9
And if he have betrothed[^h3259] her unto his son[^h1121], he shall deal[^h6213] with her after the manner[^h4941] of daughters[^h1323].
###### 10
If he take[^h3947] him another[^h312] wife; her food[^h7607], her raiment[^h3682], and her duty of marriage[^h5772], shall he not diminish[^h1639].
###### 11
And if he do[^h6213] not these three[^h7969] unto her, then shall she go out[^h3318] free[^h2600] without money[^h3701].
###### 12
He that smiteth[^h5221] a man[^h376], so that he die[^h4191], shall be surely[^h4191] put to death[^h4191].
###### 13
And if a man lie not in wait[^h6658], but God[^h430] deliver[^h579] him into his hand[^h3027]; then I will appoint[^h7760] thee a place[^h4725] whither he shall flee[^h5127].
###### 14
But if a man[^h376] come presumptuously[^h2102] upon his neighbour[^h7453], to slay[^h2026] him with guile[^h6195]; thou shalt take[^h3947] him from mine altar[^h4196], that he may die[^h4191].
###### 15
And he that smiteth[^h5221] his father[^h1], or his mother[^h517], shall be surely[^h4191] put to death[^h4191].
###### 16
And he that stealeth[^h1589] a man[^h376], and selleth[^h4376] him, or if he be found[^h4672] in his hand[^h3027], he shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 17
And he that curseth[^h7043] his father[^h1], or his mother[^h517], shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191]. 
###### 18
And if men[^h582] strive[^h7378] together, and one[^h376] smite[^h5221] another[^h7453] with a stone[^h68], or[^h176] with his fist[^h106], and he die[^h4191] not, but keepeth[^h5307] his bed[^h4904]: 
###### 19
If he rise again[^h6965], and walk[^h1980] abroad[^h2351] upon his staff[^h4938], then shall he that smote[^h5221] him be quit[^h5352]: only he shall pay[^h5414] for the loss of his time[^h7674], and shall cause him to be thoroughly[^h7495] healed[^h7495]. 
###### 20
And if a man[^h376] smite[^h5221] his servant[^h5650], or his maid[^h519], with a rod[^h7626], and he die[^h4191] under his hand[^h3027]; he shall be surely[^h5358] punished[^h5358]. 
###### 21
Notwithstanding[^h389], if he continue[^h5975] a day[^h3117] or two[^h8147], he shall not be punished[^h5358]: for he is his money[^h3701].
###### 22
If men[^h582] strive[^h5327], and hurt[^h5062] a woman[^h802] with child[^h2030], so that her fruit[^h3206] depart[^h3318] from her, and yet no mischief follow[^h611]: he shall be surely[^h6064] punished[^h6064], according as the woman's[^h802] husband[^h1167] will lay[^h7896] upon him; and he shall pay[^h5414] as the judges[^h6414] determine.
###### 23
And if any mischief follow[^h611], then thou shalt give[^h5414] life[^h5315] for life[^h5315],
###### 24
Eye[^h5869] for eye[^h5869], tooth[^h8127] for tooth[^h8127], hand[^h3027] for hand[^h3027], foot[^h7272] for foot[^h7272],
###### 25
Burning[^h3555] for burning[^h3555], wound[^h6482] for wound[^h6482], stripe[^h2250] for stripe[^h2250].
###### 26
And if a man[^h376] smite[^h5221] the eye[^h5869] of his servant[^h5650], or the eye[^h5869] of his maid[^h519], that it perish[^h7843]; he shall let him go[^h7971] free[^h2670] for[^h8478] his eye's[^h5869] sake.
###### 27
And if he smite[^h5307] out his manservant's[^h5650] tooth[^h8127], or his maidservant's[^h519] tooth[^h8127]; he shall let him go[^h7971] free[^h2670] for his tooth's[^h8127] sake.
###### 28
If an ox[^h7794] gore[^h5055] a man[^h376] or a woman[^h802], that they die[^h4191]: then the ox[^h7794] shall be surely[^h5619] stoned[^h5619], and his flesh[^h1320] shall not be eaten[^h398]; but the owner[^h1167] of the ox[^h7794] shall be quit[^h5355].
###### 29
But if the ox[^h7794] were wont to push with his horn[^h5056] in time past[^h8543] [^h8032], and it hath been testified[^h5749] to his owner[^h1167], and he hath not kept[^h8104] him in, but that he hath killed[^h4191] a man[^h376] or a woman[^h802]; the ox[^h7794] shall be stoned[^h5619], and his owner[^h1167] also shall be put to death[^h4191].
###### 30
If there be laid[^h7896] on him a sum of money[^h3724], then he shall give[^h5414] for the ransom[^h6306] of his life[^h5315] whatsoever is laid[^h7896] upon him.
###### 31
Whether he have gored[^h5055] a son[^h1121], or[^h176] have gored[^h5055] a daughter[^h1323], according to this judgment[^h4941] shall it be done[^h6213] unto him.
###### 32
If the ox[^h7794] shall push[^h5055] a manservant[^h5650] or a maidservant[^h519]; he shall give[^h5414] unto their master[^h113] thirty[^h7970] shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701], and the ox[^h7794] shall be stoned[^h5619].
###### 33
And if a man[^h376] shall open[^h6605] a pit[^h953], or if a man[^h376] shall dig[^h3738] a pit[^h953], and not cover[^h3680] it, and an ox[^h7794] or an ass[^h2543] fall[^h5307] therein;
###### 34
The owner[^h1167] of the pit[^h953] shall make it good[^h7999], and give[^h7725] money[^h3701] unto the owner[^h1167] of them; and the dead[^h4191] beast shall be his.
###### 35
And if one man's[^h376] ox[^h7794] hurt[^h5062] another's[^h7453], that he die[^h4191]; then they shall sell[^h4376] the live[^h2416] ox[^h7794], and divide[^h2673] the money[^h3701] of it; and the dead[^h4191] ox also they shall divide[^h2673].
###### 36
Or if it be known[^h3045] that the ox[^h7794] hath used to push[^h5056] in time past[^h8543] [^h8032], and his owner[^h1167] hath not kept[^h8104] him in; he shall surely[^h7999] pay[^h7999] ox[^h7794] for ox[^h7794]; and the dead[^h4191] shall be his own.

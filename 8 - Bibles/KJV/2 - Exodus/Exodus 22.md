###### 3
If the sun[^h8121] be risen[^h2224] upon him, there shall be blood[^h1818] shed for him; for he should make full[^h7999] restitution[^h7999]; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold[^h4376] for his theft[^h1591].

###### 7
If a man[^h376] shall deliver[^h5414] unto his neighbour[^h7453] money[^h3701] or stuff[^h3627] to keep[^h8104], and it be stolen[^h1589] out of the man's[^h376] house[^h1004]; if the thief[^h1590] be found[^h4672], let him pay[^h7999] double[^h8147].
###### 8

###### 10
If a man[^h376] deliver[^h5414] unto his neighbour[^h7453] an ass[^h2543], or an ox[^h7794], or a sheep[^h7716], or any beast[^h929], to keep[^h8104]; and it die[^h4191], or be hurt[^h7665], or driven away[^h7617], no man seeing[^h7200] it:
###### 11
Then shall an oath[^h7621] of the LORD[^h3068] be between them both[^h8147], that he hath not put[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] unto his neighbour's[^h7453] goods[^h4399]; and the owner[^h1167] of it shall accept[^h3947] thereof, and he shall not make it good[^h7999].

###### 15
But if the owner[^h1167] thereof be with it, he shall not make it good[^h7999]: if it be an hired[^h7916] thing, it came[^h935] for his hire[^h7939].
###### 16
And if a man[^h376] entice[^h6601] a maid[^h1330] that is not betrothed[^h781], and lie[^h7901] with her, he shall surely[^h4117] endow[^h4117] her to be his wife[^h802].

###### 19
Whosoever lieth[^h7901] with a beast[^h929] shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 20
He that sacrificeth[^h2076] unto any god[^h430], save[^h1115] unto the LORD[^h3068] only, he shall be utterly destroyed[^h2763].
###### 21
Thou shalt neither vex[^h3238] a stranger[^h1616], nor oppress[^h3905] him: for ye were strangers[^h1616] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 22
Ye shall not afflict[^h6031] any widow[^h490], or fatherless child[^h3490].
###### 23
If[^h518] thou afflict[^h6031] them in any wise[^h6031], and they cry[^h6817] at all[^h6817] unto me, I will surely[^h8085] hear[^h8085] their cry[^h6818];
###### 24
And my wrath[^h639] shall wax hot[^h2734], and I will kill[^h2026] you with the sword[^h2719]; and your wives[^h802] shall be widows[^h490], and your children[^h1121] fatherless[^h3490].
###### 25
If thou lend[^h3867] money[^h3701] to any of my people[^h5971] that is poor[^h6041] by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer[^h5383], neither shalt thou lay[^h7760] upon him usury[^h5392].
###### 26
If thou at all[^h2254] take[^h2254] thy neighbour's[^h7453] raiment[^h8008] to pledge[^h2254], thou shalt deliver[^h7725] it unto him by[^h5704] that the sun[^h8121] goeth down[^h935]:
###### 27
For that is his covering[^h3682] only, it is his raiment[^h8071] for his skin[^h5785]: wherein shall he sleep[^h7901]? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth[^h6817] unto me, that I will hear[^h8085]; for I am gracious[^h2587].
###### 28
Thou shalt not revile[^h7043] the gods[^h430], nor curse[^h779] the ruler[^h5387] of thy people[^h5971]. 
###### 29
Thou shalt not delay[^h309] to offer the first of thy ripe fruits[^h4395], and of thy liquors[^h1831]: the firstborn[^h1060] of thy sons[^h1121] shalt thou give[^h5414] unto me.  
###### 30
Likewise[^h3651] shalt thou do[^h6213] with thine oxen[^h7794], and with thy sheep[^h6629]: seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] it shall be with his dam[^h517]; on the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117] thou shalt give[^h5414] it me.
###### 31
And ye shall be holy[^h6944] men[^h582] unto me: neither shall ye eat[^h398] any flesh[^h1320] that is torn of beasts[^h2966] in the field[^h7704]; ye shall cast[^h7993] it to the dogs[^h3611].

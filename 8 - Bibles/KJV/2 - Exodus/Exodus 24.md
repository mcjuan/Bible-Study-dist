###### 2
And Moses[^h4872] alone shall come near[^h5066] the LORD[^h3068]: but they shall not come nigh[^h5066]; neither shall the people[^h5971] go up[^h5927] with him.
###### 3
And Moses[^h4872] came[^h935] and told[^h5608] the people[^h5971] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and all the judgments[^h4941]: and all the people[^h5971] answered[^h6030] with one[^h259] voice[^h6963], and said[^h559], All the words[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696] will we do[^h6213].
###### 4
And Moses[^h4872] wrote[^h3789] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and builded[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] under the hill[^h2022], and twelve pillars[^h4676], according to the twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And he sent[^h7971] young men[^h5288] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930], and sacrificed[^h2076] peace[^h8002] offerings[^h2077] of oxen[^h6499] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] half[^h2677] of the blood[^h1818], and put[^h7760] it in basons[^h101]; and half[^h2677] of the blood[^h1818] he sprinkled[^h2236] on the altar[^h4196].
###### 7
And he took[^h3947] the book[^h5612] of the covenant[^h1285], and read[^h7121] in the audience[^h241] of the people[^h5971]: and they said[^h559], All that the LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696] will we do[^h6213], and be obedient[^h8085].
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] the blood[^h1818], and sprinkled[^h2236] it on the people[^h5971], and said[^h559], Behold the blood[^h1818] of the covenant[^h1285], which the LORD[^h3068] hath made[^h3772] with you concerning all these words[^h1697].

###### 10
And they saw[^h7200] the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]: and there was under his feet[^h7272] as it were a paved[^h3840] work[^h4639] of a sapphire stone[^h5601], and as it were the body[^h6106] of heaven[^h8064] in his clearness[^h2892].
###### 11
And upon the nobles[^h678] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] he laid[^h7971] not his hand[^h3027]: also they saw[^h2372] God[^h430], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Come up[^h5927] to me into the mount[^h2022], and be there: and I will give[^h5414] thee tables[^h3871] of stone[^h68], and a law[^h8451], and commandments[^h4687] which I have written[^h3789]; that thou mayest teach[^h3384] them.
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872] rose up[^h6965], and his minister[^h8334] Joshua[^h3091]: and Moses[^h4872] went up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022] of God[^h430].
###### 14
And he said[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205], Tarry[^h3427] ye here[^h2088] for us, until we come again[^h7725] unto you: and, behold, Aaron[^h175] and Hur[^h2354] are with you: if any[^h4310] man[^h1167] have any matters[^h1697] to do[^h1167], let him come[^h5066] unto them.
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] went up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022], and a cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] the mount[^h2022].
###### 16
And the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] abode[^h7931] upon mount[^h2022] Sinai[^h5514], and the cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] it six[^h8337] days[^h3117]: and the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] he called[^h7121] unto Moses[^h4872] out of the midst[^h8432] of the cloud[^h6051].
###### 17
And the sight[^h4758] of the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] was like devouring[^h398] fire[^h784] on the top[^h7218] of the mount[^h2022] in the eyes[^h5869] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
And Moses[^h4872] went[^h935] into the midst[^h8432] of the cloud[^h6051], and gat him up[^h5927] into the mount[^h2022]: and Moses[^h4872] was in the mount[^h2022] forty[^h705] days[^h3117] and forty[^h705] nights[^h3915].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Go[^h935] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and say[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me.
###### 2
And if thou refuse[^h3986] to let them go[^h7971], behold, I will smite[^h5062] all thy borders[^h1366] with frogs[^h6854]:
###### 3
And the river[^h2975] shall bring forth[^h8317] frogs[^h6854] abundantly[^h8317], which shall go up[^h5927] and come[^h935] into thine house[^h1004], and into thy bedchamber[^h2315] [^h4904], and upon thy bed[^h4296], and into the house[^h1004] of thy servants[^h5650], and upon thy people[^h5971], and into thine ovens[^h8574], and into thy kneadingtroughs[^h4863]: 
###### 4
And the frogs[^h6854] shall come up[^h5927] both on thee, and upon thy people[^h5971], and upon all thy servants[^h5650].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Say[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Stretch forth[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] with thy rod[^h4294] over the streams[^h5104], over the rivers[^h2975], and over the ponds[^h98], and cause frogs[^h6854] to come up[^h5927] upon the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 6
And Aaron[^h175] stretched out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] over the waters[^h4325] of Egypt[^h4714]; and the frogs[^h6854] came up[^h5927], and covered[^h3680] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 7
And the magicians[^h2748] did[^h6213] so with their enchantments[^h3909], and brought up[^h5927] frogs[^h6854] upon the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 8
Then Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] for Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559], Intreat[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068], that he may take away[^h5493] the frogs[^h6854] from me, and from my people[^h5971]; and I will let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may do sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], Glory[^h6286] over me: when[^h4970] shall I intreat[^h6279] for thee, and for thy servants[^h5650], and for thy people[^h5971], to destroy[^h3772] the frogs[^h6854] from thee and thy houses[^h1004], that they may remain[^h7604] in the river[^h2975] only?   
###### 10
And he said[^h559], To morrow[^h4279]. And he said[^h559], Be it according to thy word[^h1697]: that thou mayest know[^h3045] that there is none like unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]. 
###### 11
And the frogs[^h6854] shall depart[^h5493] from thee, and from thy houses[^h1004], and from thy servants[^h5650], and from thy people[^h5971]; they shall remain[^h7604] in the river[^h2975] only.
###### 12
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went out[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547]: and Moses[^h4872] cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068] because of[^h1697] the frogs[^h6854] which he had brought[^h7760] against Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Moses[^h4872]; and the frogs[^h6854] died[^h4191] out of the houses[^h1004], out of the villages[^h2691], and out of the fields[^h7704].
###### 14
And they gathered them together[^h6651] upon heaps[^h2563]: and the land[^h776] stank[^h887].
###### 15
But when Pharaoh[^h6547] saw[^h7200] that there was respite[^h7309], he hardened[^h3513] his heart[^h3820], and hearkened[^h8085] not unto them; as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696].
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Say[^h559] unto Aaron[^h175], Stretch out[^h5186] thy rod[^h4294], and smite[^h5221] the dust[^h6083] of the land[^h776], that it may become lice[^h3654] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 17
And they did[^h6213] so; for Aaron[^h175] stretched out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] with his rod[^h4294], and smote[^h5221] the dust[^h6083] of the earth[^h776], and it became lice[^h3654] in man[^h120], and in beast[^h929]; all the dust[^h6083] of the land[^h776] became lice[^h3654] throughout all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 18
And the magicians[^h2748] did[^h6213] so with their enchantments[^h3909] to bring forth[^h3318] lice[^h3654], but they could[^h3201] not: so there were lice[^h3654] upon man[^h120], and upon beast[^h929].
###### 19
Then the magicians[^h2748] said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], This is the finger[^h676] of God[^h430]: and Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820] was hardened[^h2388], and he hearkened[^h8085] not unto them; as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696].
###### 20
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Rise up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and stand[^h3320] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547]; lo, he cometh forth[^h3318] to the water[^h4325]; and say[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me.
###### 21
Else, if thou wilt not let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], behold, I will send[^h7971] swarms[^h6157] of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants[^h5650], and upon thy people[^h5971], and into thy houses[^h1004]: and the houses[^h1004] of the Egyptians[^h4714] shall be full[^h4390] of swarms[^h6157] of flies, and also the ground[^h127] whereon they are. 
###### 22
And I will sever[^h6395] in that day[^h3117] the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657], in which my people[^h5971] dwell[^h5975], that no[^h1115] swarms[^h6157] of flies shall be[^h1961] there; to the end[^h4616] thou mayest know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] in the midst[^h7130] of the earth[^h776].
###### 23
And I will put[^h7760] a division[^h6304] between my people[^h5971] and thy people[^h5971]: to morrow[^h4279] shall this sign[^h226] be.  
###### 24
And the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] so; and there came[^h935] a grievous[^h3515] swarm[^h6157] of flies into the house[^h1004] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and into his servants'[^h5650] houses[^h1004], and into all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: the land[^h776] was corrupted[^h7843] by reason[^h6440] of the swarm[^h6157] of flies. 
###### 25
And Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] for[^h413] Moses[^h4872] and for Aaron[^h175], and said[^h559], Go[^h3212] ye, sacrifice[^h2076] to your God[^h430] in the land[^h776].
###### 26
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], It is not meet[^h3559] so to do[^h6213]; for[^h2005] we shall sacrifice[^h2076] the abomination[^h8441] of the Egyptians[^h4714] to the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]: lo, shall we sacrifice[^h2076] the abomination[^h8441] of the Egyptians[^h4714] before their eyes[^h5869], and will they not stone[^h5619] us?
###### 27
We will go[^h3212] three[^h7969] days'[^h3117] journey[^h1870] into the wilderness[^h4057], and sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], as he shall command[^h559] us.
###### 28
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559], I will let you go[^h7971], that ye may sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] in the wilderness[^h4057]; only ye shall not go[^h3212] very[^h7368] far away[^h7368]: intreat[^h6279] for me[^h1157].
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Behold, I go out[^h3318] from thee, and I will intreat[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068] that the swarms[^h6157] of flies may depart[^h5493] from Pharaoh[^h6547], from his servants[^h5650], and from his people[^h5971], to morrow[^h4279]: but[^h7535] let not Pharaoh[^h6547] deal deceitfully[^h2048] any more[^h3254] in not[^h1115] letting the people[^h5971] go[^h7971] to sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068].
###### 30
And Moses[^h4872] went out[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547], and intreated[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 31
And the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Moses[^h4872]; and he removed[^h5493] the swarms[^h6157] of flies from Pharaoh[^h6547], from his servants[^h5650], and from his people[^h5971]; there remained[^h7604] not one[^h259].
###### 32
And Pharaoh[^h6547] hardened[^h3513] his heart[^h3820] at this time[^h6471] also, neither would he let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971].

###### 1
When Jethro[^h3503], the priest[^h3548] of Midian[^h4080], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], heard[^h8085] of all that God[^h430] had done[^h6213] for Moses[^h4872], and for Israel[^h3478] his people[^h5971], and that the LORD[^h3068] had brought[^h3318] Israel[^h3478] out of Egypt[^h4714];
###### 2
Then Jethro[^h3503], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], took[^h3947] Zipporah[^h6855], Moses'[^h4872] wife[^h802], after[^h310] he had sent her back[^h7964],
###### 3
And her two[^h8147] sons[^h1121]; of which the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Gershom[^h1647]; for he said[^h559], I have been an alien[^h1616] in a strange[^h5237] land[^h776]: 
###### 4
And the name[^h8034] of the other[^h259] was Eliezer[^h461]; for the God[^h430] of my father[^h1], said he, was mine help[^h5828], and delivered[^h5337] me from the sword[^h2719] of Pharaoh[^h6547]: 
###### 5
And Jethro[^h3503], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], came[^h935] with his sons[^h1121] and his wife[^h802] unto Moses[^h4872] into the wilderness[^h4057], where he encamped[^h2583] at the mount[^h2022] of God[^h430]:
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], I thy father in law[^h2859] Jethro[^h3503] am come[^h935] unto thee, and thy wife[^h802], and her two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] with her.
###### 7
And Moses[^h4872] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] his father in law[^h2859], and did obeisance[^h7812], and kissed[^h5401] him; and they asked[^h7592] each[^h376] other[^h7453] of their welfare[^h7965]; and they came[^h935] into the tent[^h168]. 
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] told[^h5608] his father in law[^h2859] all that the LORD[^h3068] had done[^h6213] unto Pharaoh[^h6547] and to the Egyptians[^h4714] for Israel's[^h3478] sake[^h182], and all the travail[^h8513] that had come[^h4672] upon them by the way[^h1870], and how the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5337] them. 
###### 9
And Jethro[^h3503] rejoiced[^h2302] for all the goodness[^h2896] which the LORD[^h3068] had done[^h6213] to Israel[^h3478], whom he had delivered[^h5337] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714].
###### 10
And Jethro[^h3503] said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068], who hath delivered[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714], and out of the hand[^h3027] of Pharaoh[^h6547], who hath delivered[^h5337] the people[^h5971] from under the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714].
###### 11
Now I know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] is greater[^h1419] than all gods[^h430]: for in the thing[^h1697] wherein they dealt proudly[^h2102] he was above them.
###### 12
And Jethro[^h3503], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], took[^h3947] a burnt offering[^h5930] and sacrifices[^h2077] for God[^h430]: and Aaron[^h175] came[^h935], and all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] with Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859] before[^h6440] God[^h430].
###### 13
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that Moses[^h4872] sat[^h3427] to judge[^h8199] the people[^h5971]: and the people[^h5971] stood[^h5975] by Moses[^h4872] from the morning[^h1242] unto the evening[^h6153].
###### 14
And when Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859] saw[^h7200] all that he did[^h6213] to the people[^h5971], he said[^h559], What is this thing[^h1697] that thou doest[^h6213] to the people[^h5971]? why sittest[^h3427] thou thyself alone, and all the people[^h5971] stand[^h5324] by thee from morning[^h1242] unto even[^h6153]?
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto his father in law[^h2859], Because the people[^h5971] come[^h935] unto me to enquire[^h1875] of God[^h430]:
###### 16
When they have a matter[^h1697], they come[^h935] unto me; and I judge[^h8199] between one[^h376] and another[^h7453], and I do make them know[^h3045] the statutes[^h2706] of God[^h430], and his laws[^h8451]. 
###### 17
And Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859] said[^h559] unto him, The thing[^h1697] that thou doest[^h6213] is not good[^h2896].
###### 18
Thou wilt surely[^h5034] wear away[^h5034], both thou, and this people[^h5971] that is with thee: for this thing[^h1697] is too heavy[^h3515] for thee; thou art not able[^h3201] to perform[^h6213] it thyself alone. 
###### 19
Hearken[^h8085] now unto my voice[^h6963], I will give thee counsel[^h3289], and God[^h430] shall be[^h1961] with thee: Be thou for the people[^h5971] to God-ward[^h4136] [^h430], that thou mayest bring[^h935] the causes[^h1697] unto God[^h430]:
###### 20
And thou shalt teach[^h2094] [^h853] them ordinances[^h2706] and laws[^h8451], and shalt shew[^h3045] them the way[^h1870] wherein they must walk[^h3212], and the work[^h4639] that they must do[^h6213].
###### 21
Moreover thou shalt provide[^h2372] out of all the people[^h5971] able[^h2428] men[^h582], such as fear[^h3373] God[^h430], men[^h582] of truth[^h571], hating[^h8130] covetousness[^h1215]; and place[^h7760] such over them, to be rulers[^h8269] of thousands[^h505], and rulers[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], rulers[^h8269] of fifties[^h2572], and rulers[^h8269] of tens[^h6235]:
###### 22
And let them judge[^h8199] the people[^h5971] at all seasons[^h6256]: and it shall be, that every great[^h1419] matter[^h1697] they shall bring[^h935] unto thee, but every small[^h6996] matter[^h1697] they shall judge[^h8199]: so shall it be easier[^h7043] for thyself, and they shall bear[^h5375] the burden with thee.
###### 23
If thou shalt do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], and God[^h430] command[^h6680] thee so, then thou shalt be able[^h3201] to endure[^h5975], and all this people[^h5971] shall also go[^h935] to their place[^h4725] in peace[^h7965].
###### 24
So Moses[^h4872] hearkened[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of his father in law[^h2859], and did[^h6213] all that he had said[^h559].
###### 25
And Moses[^h4872] chose[^h977] able[^h2428] men[^h582] out of all Israel[^h3478], and made[^h5414] them heads[^h7218] over the people[^h5971], rulers[^h8269] of thousands[^h505], rulers[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967], rulers[^h8269] of fifties[^h2572], and rulers[^h8269] of tens[^h6235].
###### 26
And they judged[^h8199] the people[^h5971] at all seasons[^h6256]: the hard[^h7186] causes[^h1697] they brought[^h935] unto Moses[^h4872], but every small[^h6996] matter[^h1697] [^h1992] they judged[^h8199] themselves.
###### 27
And Moses[^h4872] let his father in law[^h2859] depart[^h7971]; and he went[^h3212] his way into his own land[^h776].

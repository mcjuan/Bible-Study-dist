###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Sanctify[^h6942] unto me all the firstborn[^h1060], whatsoever openeth[^h6363] the womb[^h7358] among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], both of man[^h120] and of beast[^h929]: it is mine.
###### 3
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Remember[^h2142] this[^h2088] day[^h3117], in which ye came out[^h3318] from Egypt[^h4714], out of the house[^h1004] of bondage[^h5650]; for by strength[^h2392] of hand[^h3027] the LORD[^h3068] brought you out[^h3318] from this place: there shall no leavened bread[^h2557] be eaten[^h398]. 
###### 4
This day[^h3117] came ye out[^h3318] in the month[^h2320] Abib[^h24].
###### 5
And it shall be when the LORD[^h3068] shall bring[^h935] thee into the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], and the Hittites[^h2850], and the Amorites[^h567], and the Hivites[^h2340], and the Jebusites[^h2983], which he sware[^h7650] unto thy fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] thee, a land[^h776] flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], that thou shalt keep[^h5647] this service[^h5656] in this month[^h2320].
###### 6
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] thou shalt eat[^h398] unleavened bread[^h4682], and in the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] shall be a feast[^h2282] to the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
Unleavened bread[^h4682] shall be eaten[^h398] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117]; and there shall no leavened bread[^h2557] be seen[^h7200] with thee, neither shall there be leaven[^h7603] seen[^h7200] with thee in all thy quarters[^h1366].
###### 8
And thou shalt shew[^h5046] thy son[^h1121] in that day[^h3117], saying[^h559], This is done because of[^h5668] that[^h2088] which the LORD[^h3068] did[^h6213] unto me when I came forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 9
And it shall be for a sign[^h226] unto thee upon thine hand[^h3027], and for a memorial[^h2146] between thine eyes[^h5869], that the LORD'S[^h3068] law[^h8451] may be in thy mouth[^h6310]: for with a strong[^h2389] hand[^h3027] hath the LORD[^h3068] brought thee out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 10
Thou shalt therefore keep[^h8104] this ordinance[^h2708] in his season[^h4150] from year[^h3117] to year[^h3117].
###### 11
And it shall be when the LORD[^h3068] shall bring[^h935] thee into the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], as he sware[^h7650] unto thee and to thy fathers[^h1], and shall give[^h5414] it thee,
###### 12
That thou shalt set apart[^h5674] unto the LORD[^h3068] all that openeth[^h6363] the matrix[^h7358], and every firstling[^h6363] that cometh[^h7698] of a beast[^h929] which thou hast; the males[^h2145] shall be the LORD'S[^h3068]. 
###### 13
And every firstling[^h6363] of an ass[^h2543] thou shalt redeem[^h6299] with a lamb[^h7716]; and if thou wilt not redeem[^h6299] it, then thou shalt break his neck[^h6202]: and all the firstborn[^h1060] of man[^h120] among thy children[^h1121] shalt thou redeem[^h6299]. 
###### 14
And it shall be when thy son[^h1121] asketh[^h7592] thee in time to come[^h4279], saying[^h559], What is this? that thou shalt say[^h559] unto him, By strength[^h2392] of hand[^h3027] the LORD[^h3068] brought us out[^h3318] from Egypt[^h4714], from the house[^h1004] of bondage[^h5650]: 
###### 15
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh[^h6547] would hardly[^h7185] let us go[^h7971], that the LORD[^h3068] slew[^h2026] all the firstborn[^h1060] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], both the firstborn[^h1060] of man[^h120], and the firstborn[^h1060] of beast[^h929]: therefore I sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068] all that openeth[^h6363] the matrix[^h7358], being males[^h2145]; but all the firstborn[^h1060] of my children[^h1121] I redeem[^h6299].
###### 16
And it shall be for a token[^h226] upon thine hand[^h3027], and for frontlets[^h2903] between thine eyes[^h5869]: for by strength[^h2392] of hand[^h3027] the LORD[^h3068] brought us forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 17
And it came to pass, when Pharaoh[^h6547] had let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that God[^h430] led[^h5148] them not through the way[^h1870] of the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430], although[^h3588] that was near[^h7138]; for God[^h430] said[^h559], Lest peradventure the people[^h5971] repent[^h5162] when they see[^h7200] war[^h4421], and they return[^h7725] to Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 18
But God[^h430] led[^h5437] the people[^h5971] about[^h5437], through the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927] harnessed[^h2571] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 19
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] the bones[^h6106] of Joseph[^h3130] with him: for he had straitly[^h7650] sworn[^h7650] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], God[^h430] will surely[^h6485] visit[^h6485] you; and ye shall carry up[^h5927] my bones[^h6106] away[^h5927] hence with you.
###### 20
And they took their journey[^h5265] from Succoth[^h5523], and encamped[^h2583] in Etham[^h864], in the edge[^h7097] of the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] went[^h1980] before[^h6440] them by day[^h3119] in a pillar[^h5982] of a cloud[^h6051], to lead[^h5148] them the way[^h1870]; and by night[^h3915] in a pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784], to give them light[^h215]; to go[^h3212] by day[^h3119] and night[^h3915]:
###### 22
He took not away[^h4185] the pillar[^h5982] of the cloud[^h6051] by day[^h3119], nor the pillar[^h5982] of fire[^h784] by night[^h3915], from before[^h6440] the people[^h5971].

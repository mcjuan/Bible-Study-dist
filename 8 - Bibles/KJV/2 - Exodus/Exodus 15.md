###### 1
Then sang[^h7891] Moses[^h4872] and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] this song[^h7892] unto the LORD[^h3068], and spake[^h559], saying[^h559], I will sing[^h7891] unto the LORD[^h3068], for he hath triumphed[^h1342] gloriously[^h1342]: the horse[^h5483] and his rider[^h7392] hath he thrown[^h7411] into the sea[^h3220].
###### 2
The LORD[^h3050] is my strength[^h5797] and song[^h2176], and he is become my salvation[^h3444]: he[^h2088] is my God[^h410], and I will prepare him an habitation[^h5115]; my father's[^h1] God[^h430], and I will exalt[^h7311] him.
###### 3
The LORD[^h3068] is a man[^h376] of war[^h4421]: the LORD[^h3068] is his name[^h8034].
###### 4
Pharaoh's[^h6547] chariots[^h4818] and his host[^h2428] hath he cast[^h3384] into the sea[^h3220]: his chosen[^h4005] captains[^h7991] also are drowned[^h2883] in the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 5
The depths[^h8415] have covered[^h3680] them: they sank[^h3381] into the bottom[^h4688] as[^h3644] a stone[^h68].
###### 6
Thy right hand[^h3225], O LORD[^h3068], is become glorious[^h142] in power[^h3581]: thy right hand[^h3225], O LORD[^h3068], hath dashed in pieces[^h7492] the enemy[^h341].
###### 7
And in the greatness[^h7230] of thine excellency[^h1347] thou hast overthrown[^h2040] them that rose up against[^h6965] thee: thou sentest forth[^h7971] thy wrath[^h2740], which consumed[^h398] them as stubble[^h7179].
###### 8
And with the blast[^h7307] of thy nostrils[^h639] the waters[^h4325] were gathered together[^h6192], the floods[^h5140] stood upright[^h5324] as an heap[^h5067], and the depths[^h8415] were congealed[^h7087] in the heart[^h3820] of the sea[^h3220].
###### 9
The enemy[^h341] said[^h559], I will pursue[^h7291], I will overtake[^h5381], I will divide[^h2505] the spoil[^h7998]; my lust[^h5315] shall be satisfied[^h4390] upon them; I will draw[^h7324] my sword[^h2719], my hand[^h3027] shall destroy[^h3423] them. 
###### 10
Thou didst blow[^h5398] with thy wind[^h7307], the sea[^h3220] covered[^h3680] them: they sank[^h6749] as lead[^h5777] in the mighty[^h117] waters[^h4325].
###### 11
Who is like unto thee, O LORD[^h3068], among the gods[^h410]? who is like thee, glorious[^h142] in holiness[^h6944], fearful[^h3372] in praises[^h8416], doing[^h6213] wonders[^h6382]? 
###### 12
Thou stretchedst out[^h5186] thy right hand[^h3225], the earth[^h776] swallowed[^h1104] them.
###### 13
Thou in thy mercy[^h2617] hast led forth[^h5148] the people[^h5971] which [^h2098] thou hast redeemed[^h1350]: thou hast guided[^h5095] them in thy strength[^h5797] unto thy holy[^h6944] habitation[^h5116].
###### 14
The people[^h5971] shall hear[^h8085], and be afraid[^h7264]: sorrow[^h2427] shall take hold[^h270] on the inhabitants[^h3427] of Palestina[^h6429].
###### 15
Then[^h227] the dukes[^h441] of Edom[^h123] shall be amazed[^h926]; the mighty men[^h352] of Moab[^h4124], trembling[^h7461] shall take hold[^h270] upon them; all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Canaan[^h3667] shall melt away[^h4127].
###### 16
Fear[^h367] and dread[^h6343] shall fall[^h5307] upon them; by the greatness[^h1419] of thine arm[^h2220] they shall be as still[^h1826] as a stone[^h68]; till thy people[^h5971] pass over[^h5674], O LORD[^h3068], till the people[^h5971] pass over[^h5674], which [^h2098] thou hast purchased[^h7069].
###### 17
Thou shalt bring[^h935] them in, and plant[^h5193] them in the mountain[^h2022] of thine inheritance[^h5159], in the place[^h4349], O LORD[^h3068], which thou hast made[^h6466] for thee to dwell in[^h3427], in the Sanctuary[^h4720], O Lord[^h136], which thy hands[^h3027] have established[^h3559].
###### 18
The LORD[^h3068] shall reign[^h4427] for ever[^h5769] and ever[^h5703].
###### 19
For the horse[^h5483] of Pharaoh[^h6547] went in[^h935] with his chariots[^h7393] and with his horsemen[^h6571] into the sea[^h3220], and the LORD[^h3068] brought again[^h7725] the waters[^h4325] of the sea[^h3220] upon them; but the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h1980] on dry[^h3004] land in the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220].
###### 20
And Miriam[^h4813] the prophetess[^h5031], the sister[^h269] of Aaron[^h175], took[^h3947] a timbrel[^h8596] in her hand[^h3027]; and all the women[^h802] went out[^h3318] after[^h310] her with timbrels[^h8596] and with dances[^h4246].
###### 21
And Miriam[^h4813] answered[^h6030] them, Sing[^h7891] ye to the LORD[^h3068], for he hath triumphed[^h1342] gloriously[^h1342]; the horse[^h5483] and his rider[^h7392] hath he thrown[^h7411] into the sea[^h3220].
###### 22
So Moses[^h4872] brought[^h5265] Israel[^h3478] from the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], and they went out[^h3318] into the wilderness[^h4057] of Shur[^h7793]; and they went[^h3212] three[^h7969] days[^h3117] in the wilderness[^h4057], and found[^h4672] no water[^h4325].
###### 23
And when they came[^h935] to Marah[^h4785], they could[^h3201] not drink[^h8354] of the waters[^h4325] of Marah[^h4785], for they were bitter[^h4751]: therefore the name[^h8034] of it was called[^h7121] Marah[^h4785]. 
###### 24
And the people[^h5971] murmured[^h3885] against Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559], What shall we drink[^h8354]?
###### 25
And he cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and the LORD[^h3068] shewed[^h3384] him a tree[^h6086], which when he had cast[^h7993] into the waters[^h4325], the waters[^h4325] were made sweet[^h4985]: there he made[^h7760] for them a statute[^h2706] and an ordinance[^h4941], and there he proved[^h5254] them,
###### 26
And said[^h559], If thou wilt diligently[^h8085] hearken[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and wilt do[^h6213] that which is right[^h3477] in his sight[^h5869], and wilt give ear[^h238] to his commandments[^h4687], and keep[^h8104] all his statutes[^h2706], I will put[^h7760] none of these diseases[^h4245] upon thee, which I have brought[^h7760] upon the Egyptians[^h4714]: for I am the LORD[^h3068] that healeth[^h7495] thee.
###### 27
And they came[^h935] to Elim[^h362], where were twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] wells[^h5869] of water[^h4325], and threescore and ten[^h7657] palm trees[^h8558]: and they encamped[^h2583] there by the waters[^h4325].

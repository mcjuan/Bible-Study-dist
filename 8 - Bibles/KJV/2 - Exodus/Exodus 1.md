###### 1
Now these are the names[^h8034] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which came[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714]; every man[^h376] and his household[^h1004] came[^h935] with Jacob[^h3290].
###### 2
Reuben[^h7205], Simeon[^h8095], Levi[^h3878], and Judah[^h3063],
###### 3
Issachar[^h3485], Zebulun[^h2074], and Benjamin[^h1144],
###### 4
Dan[^h1835], and Naphtali[^h5321], Gad[^h1410], and Asher[^h836].
###### 5
And all the souls[^h5315] that came out[^h3318] of the loins[^h3409] of Jacob[^h3290] were seventy[^h7657] souls[^h5315]: for Joseph[^h3130] was in Egypt[^h4714] already. 
###### 6
And Joseph[^h3130] died[^h4191], and all his brethren[^h251], and all that generation[^h1755].
###### 7
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were fruitful[^h6509], and increased abundantly[^h8317], and multiplied[^h7235], and waxed exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] mighty[^h6105]; and the land[^h776] was filled[^h4390] with them.
###### 8
Now there arose up[^h6965] a new[^h2319] king[^h4428] over Egypt[^h4714], which knew[^h3045] not Joseph[^h3130].
###### 9
And he said[^h559] unto his people[^h5971], Behold, the people[^h5971] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] are more[^h7227] and mightier[^h6099] than we:
###### 10
Come on[^h3051], let us deal wisely[^h2449] with them; lest they multiply[^h7235], and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out[^h7122] any war[^h4421], they[^h1931] join[^h3254] also unto our enemies[^h8130], and fight[^h3898] against us, and so get them up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776].
###### 11
Therefore they did set[^h7760] over them taskmasters[^h4522] [^h8269] to afflict[^h6031] them with their burdens[^h5450]. And they built[^h1129] for Pharaoh[^h6547] treasure[^h4543] cities[^h5892], Pithom[^h6619] and Raamses[^h7486].
###### 12
But the more they afflicted[^h6031] them, the more[^h3651] they multiplied[^h7235] and grew[^h6555]. And they were grieved[^h6973] because[^h6440] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 13
And the Egyptians[^h4714] made[^h5647] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] to serve[^h5647] with rigour[^h6531]:
###### 14
And they made[^h4843] their lives[^h2416] bitter[^h4843] with hard[^h7186] bondage[^h5656], in morter[^h2563], and in brick[^h3843], and in all manner of service[^h5656] in the field[^h7704]: all their service[^h5656], wherein they made them serve[^h5647], was with rigour[^h6531].
###### 15
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] spake[^h559] to the Hebrew[^h5680] midwives[^h3205], of which the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Shiphrah[^h8236], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Puah[^h6326]:
###### 16
And he said[^h559], When ye do the office of a midwife[^h3205] to the Hebrew women[^h5680], and see[^h7200] them upon the stools[^h70]; if it be a son[^h1121], then ye shall kill[^h4191] him: but if it be a daughter[^h1323], then she shall live[^h2425].
###### 17
But the midwives[^h3205] feared[^h3372] God[^h430], and did[^h6213] not as the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] commanded[^h1696] them, but saved[^h2421] the men children[^h3206] alive[^h2421].
###### 18
And the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] called[^h7121] for the midwives[^h3205], and said[^h559] unto them, Why[^h4069] have ye done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697], and have saved[^h2421] the men children[^h3206] alive[^h2421]?
###### 19
And the midwives[^h3205] said[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], Because the Hebrew[^h5680] women[^h802] are not as the Egyptian women[^h4713]; for they are lively[^h2422], and are delivered[^h3205] ere[^h2962] the midwives[^h3205] come in[^h935] unto them.
###### 20
Therefore God[^h430] dealt well[^h3190] with the midwives[^h3205]: and the people[^h5971] multiplied[^h7235], and waxed very[^h3966] mighty[^h6105].
###### 21
And it came to pass, because the midwives[^h3205] feared[^h3372] God[^h430], that he made[^h6213] them houses[^h1004].
###### 22
And Pharaoh[^h6547] charged[^h6680] all his people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Every son[^h1121] that is born[^h3209] ye shall cast[^h7993] into the river[^h2975], and every daughter[^h1323] ye shall save alive[^h2421].

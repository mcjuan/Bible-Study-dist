###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], saying[^h559],
###### 2
This month[^h2320] shall be unto you the beginning[^h7218] of months[^h2320]: it shall be the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] of the year[^h8141] to you.
###### 3
Speak[^h1696] ye unto all the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], In the tenth[^h6218] day of this month[^h2320] they shall take[^h3947] to them every man[^h376] a lamb[^h7716], according to the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1], a lamb[^h7716] for an house[^h1004]: 
###### 4
And if the household[^h1004] be[^h1961] too little[^h4591] for the lamb[^h7716], let him and his neighbour[^h7934] next[^h7138] unto his house[^h1004] take[^h3947] it according to the number[^h4373] of the souls[^h5315]; every man[^h376] according[^h6310] to his eating[^h400] shall make your count[^h3699] for the lamb[^h7716].
###### 5
Your lamb[^h7716] shall be without blemish[^h8549], a male[^h2145] of the first[^h1121] year[^h8141]: ye shall take[^h3947] it out from the sheep[^h3532], or from the goats[^h5795]: 
###### 6
And ye shall keep[^h4931] it up until the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the same month[^h2320]: and the whole[^h3605] assembly[^h6951] of the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478] shall kill[^h7819] it in[^h996] the evening[^h6153]. 
###### 7
And they shall take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818], and strike[^h5414] it on the two[^h8147] side posts[^h4201] and on the upper door post[^h4947] of the houses[^h1004], wherein they shall eat[^h398] it.
###### 8
And they shall eat[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] in that night[^h3915], roast[^h6748] with fire[^h784], and unleavened bread[^h4682]; and with bitter[^h4844] herbs they shall eat[^h398] it.
###### 9
Eat[^h398] not of it raw[^h4995], nor sodden[^h1310] [^h1311] at all with water[^h4325], but roast[^h6748] with fire[^h784]; his head[^h7218] with his legs[^h3767], and with the purtenance[^h7130] thereof.
###### 10
And ye shall let nothing of it remain[^h3498] until the morning[^h1242]; and that which remaineth[^h3498] of it until the morning[^h1242] ye shall burn[^h8313] with fire[^h784].
###### 11
And thus[^h3602] shall ye eat[^h398] it; with your loins[^h4975] girded[^h2296], your shoes[^h5275] on your feet[^h7272], and your staff[^h4731] in your hand[^h3027]; and ye shall eat[^h398] it in haste[^h2649]: it is the LORD'S[^h3068] passover[^h6453].
###### 12
For I will pass[^h5674] through the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] this night[^h3915], and will smite[^h5221] all the firstborn[^h1060] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], both man[^h120] and beast[^h929]; and against all the gods[^h430] of Egypt[^h4714] I will execute[^h6213] judgment[^h8201]: I am the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 13
And the blood[^h1818] shall be to you for a token[^h226] upon the houses[^h1004] where ye are: and when I see[^h7200] the blood[^h1818], I will pass[^h6452] over you, and the plague[^h5063] shall not be upon you to destroy[^h4889] you, when I smite[^h5221] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 14
And this day[^h3117] shall be unto you for a memorial[^h2146]; and ye shall keep[^h2287] it a feast[^h2282] to the LORD[^h3068] throughout your generations[^h1755]; ye shall keep it a feast[^h2287] by an ordinance[^h2708] for ever[^h5769].
###### 15
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shall ye eat[^h398] unleavened bread[^h4682]; even[^h389] the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] ye shall put away[^h7673] leaven[^h7603] out of your houses[^h1004]: for whosoever eateth[^h398] leavened bread[^h2557] from the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] until the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], that soul[^h5315] shall be cut[^h3772] off from Israel[^h3478].
###### 16
And in the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] there shall be an holy[^h6944] convocation[^h4744], and in the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] there shall be an holy[^h6944] convocation[^h4744] to you; no manner of work[^h4399] shall be done[^h6213] in them, save[^h389] that which every man[^h5315] must eat[^h398], that only may be done[^h6213] of you. 
###### 17
And ye shall observe[^h8104] the feast of unleavened bread[^h4682]; for in this selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117] have I brought[^h3318] your armies[^h6635] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: therefore shall ye observe[^h8104] this day[^h3117] in your generations[^h1755] by an ordinance[^h2708] for ever[^h5769].
###### 18
In the first[^h7223] month, on the fourteenth[^h6240] [^h702] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] at even[^h6153], ye shall eat[^h398] unleavened bread[^h4682], until the one[^h259] and twentieth[^h6242] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] at even[^h6153].
###### 19
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shall there be no leaven[^h7603] found[^h4672] in your houses[^h1004]: for whosoever eateth[^h398] that which is leavened[^h2556], even that soul[^h5315] shall be cut off[^h3772] from the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478], whether he be a stranger[^h1616], or born[^h249] in the land[^h776].
###### 20
Ye shall eat[^h398] nothing leavened[^h2556]; in all your habitations[^h4186] shall ye eat[^h398] unleavened bread[^h4682].
###### 21
Then Moses[^h4872] called[^h7121] for all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto them, Draw out[^h4900] and take[^h3947] you a lamb[^h6629] according to your families[^h4940], and kill[^h7819] the passover[^h6453]. 
###### 22
And ye shall take[^h3947] a bunch[^h92] of hyssop[^h231], and dip[^h2881] it in the blood[^h1818] that is in the bason[^h5592], and strike[^h5060] the lintel[^h4947] and the two[^h8147] side posts[^h4201] with the blood[^h1818] that is in the bason[^h5592]; and none[^h376] of you shall go out[^h3318] at the door[^h6607] of his house[^h1004] until the morning[^h1242].
###### 23
For the LORD[^h3068] will pass through[^h5674] to smite[^h5062] the Egyptians[^h4714]; and when he seeth[^h7200] the blood[^h1818] upon the lintel[^h4947], and on the two[^h8147] side posts[^h4201], the LORD[^h3068] will pass over[^h6452] the door[^h6607], and will not suffer[^h5414] the destroyer[^h7843] to come[^h935] in unto your houses[^h1004] to smite[^h5062] you.
###### 24
And ye shall observe[^h8104] this thing[^h1697] for an ordinance[^h2706] to thee and to thy sons[^h1121] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 25
And it shall come to pass, when ye be come[^h935] to the land[^h776] which the LORD[^h3068] will give[^h5414] you, according as he hath promised[^h1696], that ye shall keep[^h8104] this service[^h5656].
###### 26
And it shall come to pass, when your children[^h1121] shall say[^h559] unto you, What mean ye by this service[^h5656]?
###### 27
That ye shall say[^h559], It is the sacrifice[^h2077] of the LORD'S[^h3068] passover[^h6453], who passed[^h6452] over the houses[^h1004] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in Egypt[^h4714], when he smote[^h5062] the Egyptians[^h4714], and delivered[^h5337] our houses[^h1004]. And the people[^h5971] bowed the head[^h6915] and worshipped[^h7812].
###### 28
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went away[^h3212], and did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], so did[^h6213] they.
###### 29
And it came to pass, that at midnight[^h2677] [^h3915] the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5221] all the firstborn[^h1060] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from the firstborn[^h1060] of Pharaoh[^h6547] that sat[^h3427] on his throne[^h3678] unto the firstborn[^h1060] of the captive[^h7628] that was in the dungeon[^h1004] [^h953]; and all the firstborn[^h1060] of cattle[^h929]. 
###### 30
And Pharaoh[^h6547] rose up[^h6965] in the night[^h3915], he, and all his servants[^h5650], and all the Egyptians[^h4714]; and there was a great[^h1419] cry[^h6818] in Egypt[^h4714]; for there was not a house[^h1004] where there was not one dead[^h4191].
###### 31
And he called[^h7121] for Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] by night[^h3915], and said[^h559], Rise up[^h6965], and get you forth[^h3318] from among[^h8432] my people[^h5971], both ye and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; and go[^h3212], serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068], as ye have said[^h1696].
###### 32
Also take[^h3947] your flocks[^h6629] and your herds[^h1241], as ye have said[^h1696], and be gone[^h3212]; and bless[^h1288] me also.
###### 33
And the Egyptians[^h4714] were urgent[^h2388] upon the people[^h5971], that they might send[^h7971] them out of the land[^h776] in haste[^h4116]; for they said[^h559], We be all dead[^h4191] men.
###### 34
And the people[^h5971] took[^h5375] their dough[^h1217] before it was leavened[^h2556], their kneadingtroughs[^h4863] being bound up[^h6887] in their clothes[^h8071] upon their shoulders[^h7926]. 
###### 35
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] according to the word[^h1697] of Moses[^h4872]; and they borrowed[^h7592] of the Egyptians[^h4714] jewels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701], and jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], and raiment[^h8071]:
###### 36
And the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] the people[^h5971] favour[^h2580] in the sight[^h5869] of the Egyptians[^h4714], so that they lent[^h7592] unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled[^h5337] the Egyptians[^h4714].
###### 37
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] journeyed[^h5265] from Rameses[^h7486] to Succoth[^h5523], about six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] on foot[^h7273] that were men[^h1397], beside[^h905] children[^h2945].
###### 38
And a mixed[^h6154] multitude[^h7227] went up[^h5927] also with them; and flocks[^h6629], and herds[^h1241], even very[^h3966] much[^h3515] cattle[^h4735]. 
###### 39
And they baked[^h644] unleavened[^h4682] cakes[^h5692] of the dough[^h1217] which they brought forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714], for it was not leavened[^h2556]; because they were thrust out[^h1644] of Egypt[^h4714], and could[^h3201] not tarry[^h4102], neither had they prepared[^h6213] for themselves any victual[^h6720].
###### 40
Now the sojourning[^h4186] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], who dwelt[^h3427] in Egypt[^h4714], was four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141].
###### 41
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of the four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] [^h8141] and thirty[^h7970] years[^h8141], even the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117] it came to pass, that all the hosts[^h6635] of the LORD[^h3068] went out[^h3318] from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 42
It is a night[^h3915] to be much observed[^h8107] unto the LORD[^h3068] for bringing[^h3318] them out from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: this is that night[^h3915] of the LORD[^h3068] to be observed[^h8107] of all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in their generations[^h1755]. 
###### 43
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], This is the ordinance[^h2708] of the passover[^h6453]: There shall no stranger[^h1121] [^h5236] eat[^h398] thereof:
###### 44
But every man's[^h376] servant[^h5650] that is bought[^h4736] for money[^h3701], when thou hast circumcised[^h4135] him, then shall he eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 45
A foreigner[^h8453] and an hired servant[^h7916] shall not eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 46
In one[^h259] house[^h1004] shall it be eaten[^h398]; thou shalt not carry forth[^h3318] ought of the flesh[^h1320] abroad[^h2351] out of the house[^h1004]; neither shall ye break[^h7665] a bone[^h6106] thereof.
###### 47
All the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478] shall keep[^h6213] it. 
###### 48
And when a stranger[^h1616] shall sojourn[^h1481] with thee, and will keep[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] to the LORD[^h3068], let all his males[^h2145] be circumcised[^h4135], and then let him come near[^h7126] and keep[^h6213] it; and he shall be as one that is born[^h249] in the land[^h776]: for no uncircumcised person[^h6189] shall eat[^h398] thereof.
###### 49
One[^h259] law[^h8451] shall be to him that is homeborn[^h249], and unto the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] among[^h8432] you.
###### 50
Thus did[^h6213] all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], so did[^h6213] they.
###### 51
And it came to pass the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117], that the LORD[^h3068] did bring[^h3318] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] by their armies[^h6635].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], saying[^h559],
###### 2
On the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] of the first[^h259] month[^h2320] shalt thou set up[^h6965] the tabernacle[^h4908] of the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 3
And thou shalt put[^h7760] therein[^h8033] the ark[^h727] of the testimony[^h5715], and cover[^h5526] the ark[^h727] with the vail[^h6532].
###### 4
And thou shalt bring[^h935] in the table[^h7979], and set in order[^h6186] the things that are to be set in order[^h6187] upon it; and thou shalt bring[^h935] in the candlestick[^h4501], and light[^h5927] the lamps[^h5216] thereof. 
###### 5
And thou shalt set[^h5414] the altar[^h4196] of gold[^h2091] for the incense[^h7004] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the testimony[^h5715], and put[^h7760] the hanging[^h4539] of the door[^h6607] to the tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 6
And thou shalt set[^h5414] the altar[^h4196] of the burnt offering[^h5930] before[^h6440] the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h4908] of the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 7
And thou shalt set[^h5414] the laver[^h3595] between the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] and the altar[^h4196], and shalt put[^h5414] water[^h4325] therein.
###### 8
And thou shalt set up[^h7760] the court[^h2691] round about[^h5439], and hang up[^h5414] the hanging[^h4539] at the court[^h2691] gate[^h8179].
###### 9
And thou shalt take[^h3947] the anointing[^h4888] oil[^h8081], and anoint[^h4886] the tabernacle[^h4908], and all that is therein, and shalt hallow[^h6942] it, and all the vessels[^h3627] thereof: and it shall be holy[^h6944].
###### 10
And thou shalt anoint[^h4886] the altar[^h4196] of the burnt offering[^h5930], and all his vessels[^h3627], and sanctify[^h6942] the altar[^h4196]: and it shall be an altar[^h4196] most[^h6944] holy[^h6944]. 
###### 11
And thou shalt anoint[^h4886] the laver[^h3595] and his foot[^h3653], and sanctify[^h6942] it.
###### 12
And thou shalt bring[^h7126] Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] unto the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and wash[^h7364] them with water[^h4325].
###### 13
And thou shalt put[^h3847] upon Aaron[^h175] the holy[^h6944] garments[^h899], and anoint[^h4886] him, and sanctify[^h6942] him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office[^h3547].
###### 14
And thou shalt bring[^h7126] his sons[^h1121], and clothe[^h3847] them with coats[^h3801]:
###### 15
And thou shalt anoint[^h4886] them, as thou didst anoint[^h4886] their father[^h1], that they may minister unto me in the priest's office[^h3547]: for their anointing[^h4888] shall surely be an everlasting[^h5769] priesthood[^h3550] throughout their generations[^h1755].
###### 16
Thus did[^h6213] Moses[^h4872]: according to all that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] him, so did[^h6213] he.
###### 17
And it came to pass in the first[^h7223] month[^h2320] in the second[^h8145] year[^h8141], on the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], that the tabernacle[^h4908] was reared up[^h6965].
###### 18
And Moses[^h4872] reared up[^h6965] the tabernacle[^h4908], and fastened[^h5414] his sockets[^h134], and set up[^h7760] the boards[^h7175] thereof, and put[^h5414] in the bars[^h1280] thereof, and reared up[^h6965] his pillars[^h5982].
###### 19
And he spread abroad[^h6566] the tent[^h168] over the tabernacle[^h4908], and put[^h7760] the covering[^h4372] of the tent[^h168] above[^h4605] upon it; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 20
And he took[^h3947] and put[^h5414] the testimony[^h5715] into the ark[^h727], and set[^h7760] the staves[^h905] on the ark[^h727], and put[^h5414] the mercy seat[^h3727] above[^h4605] upon the ark[^h727]:
###### 21
And he brought[^h935] the ark[^h727] into the tabernacle[^h4908], and set up[^h7760] the vail[^h6532] of the covering[^h4539], and covered[^h5526] the ark[^h727] of the testimony[^h5715]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 22
And he put[^h5414] the table[^h7979] in the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], upon the side[^h3409] of the tabernacle[^h4908] northward[^h6828], without[^h2351] the vail[^h6532].
###### 23
And he set[^h6187] the bread[^h3899] in order[^h6186] upon it before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; as the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 24
And he put[^h7760] the candlestick[^h4501] in the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], over against[^h5227] the table[^h7979], on the side[^h3409] of the tabernacle[^h4908] southward[^h5045].
###### 25
And he lighted[^h5927] the lamps[^h5216] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 26
And he put[^h7760] the golden[^h2091] altar[^h4196] in the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] before[^h6440] the vail[^h6532]:
###### 27
And he burnt[^h6999] sweet[^h5561] incense[^h7004] thereon; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 28
And he set up[^h7760] the hanging[^h4539] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 29
And he put[^h7760] the altar[^h4196] of burnt offering[^h5930] by the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h4908] of the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and offered[^h5927] upon it the burnt offering[^h5930] and the meat offering[^h4503]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 30
And he set[^h7760] the laver[^h3595] between the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] and the altar[^h4196], and put[^h5414] water[^h4325] there, to wash[^h7364] withal.
###### 31
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] washed[^h7364] their hands[^h3027] and their feet[^h7272] thereat:
###### 32
When they went[^h935] into the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and when they came near[^h7126] unto the altar[^h4196], they washed[^h7364]; as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 33
And he reared up[^h6965] the court[^h2691] round about[^h5439] the tabernacle[^h4908] and the altar[^h4196], and set up[^h5414] the hanging[^h4539] of the court[^h2691] gate[^h8179]. So Moses[^h4872] finished[^h3615] the work[^h4399].
###### 34
Then a cloud[^h6051] covered[^h3680] the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] filled[^h4390] the tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 35
And Moses[^h4872] was not able[^h3201] to enter[^h935] into the tent[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], because the cloud[^h6051] abode[^h7931] thereon, and the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] filled[^h4390] the tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 36
And when the cloud[^h6051] was taken up[^h5927] from[^h5921] over the tabernacle[^h4908], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went onward[^h5265] in all their journeys[^h4550]: 
###### 37
But if the cloud[^h6051] were not taken up[^h5927], then they journeyed[^h5265] not till the day[^h3117] that it was taken up[^h5927].
###### 38
For the cloud[^h6051] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon the tabernacle[^h4908] by day[^h3119], and fire[^h784] was on it by night[^h3915], in the sight[^h5869] of all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], throughout all their journeys[^h4550].

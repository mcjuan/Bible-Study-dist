###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Go[^h935] in unto Pharaoh[^h6547]: for I have hardened[^h3513] his heart[^h3820], and the heart[^h3820] of his servants[^h5650], that I might shew[^h7896] these my signs[^h226] before[^h7130] him:
###### 2
And that thou mayest tell[^h5608] in the ears[^h241] of thy son[^h1121], and of thy son's[^h1121] son[^h1121], what things I have wrought[^h5953] in Egypt[^h4714], and my signs[^h226] which I have done[^h7760] among them; that ye may know[^h3045] how that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] came in[^h935] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of the Hebrews[^h5680], How long[^h4970] wilt thou refuse[^h3985] to humble[^h6031] thyself before[^h6440] me? let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] me.
###### 4
Else[^h3588], if thou refuse[^h3986] to let my people[^h5971] go[^h7971], behold, to morrow[^h4279] will I bring[^h935] the locusts[^h697] into thy coast[^h1366]:
###### 5
And they shall cover[^h3680] the face[^h5869] of the earth[^h776], that one cannot be able[^h3201] to see[^h7200] the earth[^h776]: and they shall eat[^h398] the residue[^h3499] of that which is escaped[^h6413], which remaineth[^h7604] unto you from the hail[^h1259], and shall eat[^h398] every tree[^h6086] which groweth[^h6779] for you out of the field[^h7704]: 
###### 6
And they shall fill[^h4390] thy houses[^h1004], and the houses[^h1004] of all thy servants[^h5650], and the houses[^h1004] of all the Egyptians[^h4714]; which neither thy fathers[^h1], nor thy fathers'[^h1] fathers[^h1] have seen[^h7200], since the day[^h3117] that they were upon the earth[^h127] unto this day[^h3117]. And he turned[^h6437] himself, and went out[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547].
###### 7
And Pharaoh's[^h6547] servants[^h5650] said[^h559] unto him, How long shall this man be a snare[^h4170] unto us? let the men[^h582] go[^h7971], that they may serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430]: knowest[^h3045] thou not yet[^h2962] that Egypt[^h4714] is destroyed[^h6]?
###### 8
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] were brought again[^h7725] unto Pharaoh[^h6547]: and he said[^h559] unto them, Go[^h3212], serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]: but who are they that shall go[^h1980]? 
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], We will go[^h3212] with our young[^h5288] and with our old[^h2205], with our sons[^h1121] and with our daughters[^h1323], with our flocks[^h6629] and with our herds[^h1241] will we go[^h3212]; for we must hold a feast[^h2282] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
And he said[^h559] unto them, Let the LORD[^h3068] be so with you, as I will let you go[^h7971], and your little ones[^h2945]: look[^h7200] to it; for evil[^h7451] is before[^h6440] you.
###### 11
Not so: go[^h3212] now ye that are men[^h1397], and serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068]; for that ye did desire[^h1245]. And they were driven out[^h1644] from Pharaoh's[^h6547] presence[^h6440].
###### 12
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Stretch out[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] over the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] for the locusts[^h697], that they may come up[^h5927] upon the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and eat[^h398] every herb[^h6212] of the land[^h776], even all that the hail[^h1259] hath left[^h7604].
###### 13
And Moses[^h4872] stretched forth[^h5186] his rod[^h4294] over the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and the LORD[^h3068] brought[^h5090] an east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] upon the land[^h776] all that day[^h3117], and all that night[^h3915]; and when it was morning[^h1242], the east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] brought[^h5375] the locusts[^h697].
###### 14
And the locusts[^h697] went up[^h5927] over all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and rested[^h5117] in all the coasts[^h1366] of Egypt[^h4714]: very[^h3966] grievous[^h3515] were they; before[^h6440] them there were no such[^h3651] locusts[^h697] as they, neither after[^h310] them shall be such.
###### 15
For they covered[^h3680] the face[^h5869] of the whole earth[^h776], so that the land[^h776] was darkened[^h2821]; and they did eat[^h398] every herb[^h6212] of the land[^h776], and all the fruit[^h6529] of the trees[^h6086] which the hail[^h1259] had left[^h3498]: and there remained[^h3498] not any green thing[^h3418] in the trees[^h6086], or in the herbs[^h6212] of the field[^h7704], through all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 16
Then Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] for Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] in haste[^h4116]; and he said[^h559], I have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and against you. 
###### 17
Now therefore forgive[^h5375], I pray thee, my sin[^h2403] only this once[^h6471], and intreat[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], that he may take away[^h5493] from me this death[^h4194] only.
###### 18
And he went out[^h3318] from Pharaoh[^h6547], and intreated[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] turned[^h2015] a mighty[^h3966] strong[^h2389] west[^h3220] wind[^h7307], which took away[^h5375] the locusts[^h697], and cast[^h8628] them into the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220]; there remained[^h7604] not one[^h259] locust[^h697] in all the coasts[^h1366] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 20
But the LORD[^h3068] hardened[^h2388] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], so that he would not let the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] go[^h7971].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Stretch out[^h5186] thine hand[^h3027] toward heaven[^h8064], that there may be darkness[^h2822] over the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], even darkness[^h2822] which may be felt[^h4959]. 
###### 22
And Moses[^h4872] stretched forth[^h5186] his hand[^h3027] toward heaven[^h8064]; and there was a thick[^h653] darkness[^h2822] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] three[^h7969] days[^h3117]:
###### 23
They saw[^h7200] not one[^h376] another[^h251], neither rose[^h6965] any[^h376] from his place for three[^h7969] days[^h3117]: but all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] had light[^h216] in their dwellings[^h4186].
###### 24
And Pharaoh[^h6547] called[^h7121] unto Moses[^h4872], and said[^h559], Go[^h3212] ye, serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068]; only let your flocks[^h6629] and your herds[^h1241] be stayed[^h3322]: let your little ones[^h2945] also go[^h3212] with you.
###### 25
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Thou must give[^h5414] us[^h3027] also sacrifices[^h2077] and burnt offerings[^h5930], that we may sacrifice[^h6213] unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]. 
###### 26
Our cattle[^h4735] also shall go[^h3212] with us; there shall not an hoof[^h6541] be left behind[^h7604]; for thereof must we take[^h3947] to serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]; and we know[^h3045] not with what we must serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068], until we come[^h935] thither.
###### 27
But the LORD[^h3068] hardened[^h2388] Pharaoh's[^h6547] heart[^h3820], and he would[^h14] not let them go[^h7971].
###### 28
And Pharaoh[^h6547] said[^h559] unto him, Get[^h3212] thee from me, take heed[^h8104] to thyself, see[^h7200] my face[^h6440] no more[^h3254]; for in that day[^h3117] thou seest[^h7200] my face[^h6440] thou shalt die[^h4191].
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559], Thou hast spoken[^h1696] well[^h3651], I will see[^h7200] thy face[^h6440] again[^h3254] no more.

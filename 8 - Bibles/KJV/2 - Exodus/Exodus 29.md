###### 8

###### 9
And thou shalt gird[^h2296] them with girdles[^h73], Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121], and put[^h2280] the bonnets[^h4021] on them: and the priest's office[^h3550] shall be theirs for a perpetual[^h5769] statute[^h2708]: and thou shalt consecrate[^h4390] [^h3027] Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121].  
###### 10
And thou shalt cause a bullock[^h6499] to be brought[^h7126] before[^h6440] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]: and Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] shall put[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon the head[^h7218] of the bullock[^h6499].

###### 12
And thou shalt take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818] of the bullock[^h6499], and put[^h5414] it upon the horns[^h7161] of the altar[^h4196] with thy finger[^h676], and pour[^h8210] all the blood[^h1818] beside[^h413] the bottom[^h3247] of the altar[^h4196].

###### 15
Thou shalt also take[^h3947] one[^h259] ram[^h352]; and Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] shall put[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon the head[^h7218] of the ram[^h352].
###### 16
And thou shalt slay[^h7819] the ram[^h352], and thou shalt take[^h3947] his blood[^h1818], and sprinkle[^h2236] it round about[^h5439] upon the altar[^h4196].
###### 17
And thou shalt cut[^h5408] the ram[^h352] in pieces[^h5409], and wash[^h7364] the inwards[^h7130] of him, and his legs[^h3767], and put[^h5414] them unto his pieces[^h5409], and unto his head[^h7218]. 
###### 18
And thou shalt burn[^h6999] the whole ram[^h352] upon the altar[^h4196]: it is a burnt offering[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068]: it is a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381], an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 19
And thou shalt take[^h3947] the other[^h8145] ram[^h352]; and Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] shall put[^h5564] their hands[^h3027] upon the head[^h7218] of the ram[^h352].
###### 20

###### 21
And thou shalt take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818] that is upon the altar[^h4196], and of the anointing[^h4888] oil[^h8081], and sprinkle[^h5137] it upon Aaron[^h175], and upon his garments[^h899], and upon his sons[^h1121], and upon the garments[^h899] of his sons[^h1121] with him: and he shall be hallowed[^h6942], and his garments[^h899], and his sons[^h1121], and his sons'[^h1121] garments[^h899] with him.
###### 22
Also thou shalt take[^h3947] of the ram[^h352] the fat[^h2459] and the rump[^h451], and the fat[^h2459] that covereth[^h3680] the inwards[^h7130], and the caul[^h3508] above the liver[^h3516], and the two[^h8147] kidneys[^h3629], and the fat[^h2459] that is upon them, and the right[^h3225] shoulder[^h7785]; for it is a ram[^h352] of consecration[^h4394]:
###### 23
And one[^h259] loaf[^h3603] of bread[^h3899], and one[^h259] cake[^h2471] of oiled[^h8081] bread, and one[^h259] wafer[^h7550] out of the basket[^h5536] of the unleavened bread[^h4682] that is before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 24
And thou shalt put[^h7760] all in the hands[^h3709] of Aaron[^h175], and in the hands[^h3709] of his sons[^h1121]; and shalt wave[^h5130] them for a wave offering[^h8573] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 25
And thou shalt receive[^h3947] them of their hands[^h3027], and burn[^h6999] them upon the altar[^h4196] for a burnt offering[^h5930], for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: it is an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 26
And thou shalt take[^h3947] the breast[^h2373] of the ram[^h352] of Aaron's[^h175] consecration[^h4394], and wave[^h5130] it for a wave offering[^h8573] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and it shall be thy part[^h4490].
###### 27
And thou shalt sanctify[^h6942] the breast[^h2373] of the wave offering[^h8573], and the shoulder[^h7785] of the heave offering[^h8641], which is waved[^h5130], and which is heaved up[^h7311], of the ram[^h352] of the consecration[^h4394], even of that which[^h834] is for Aaron[^h175], and of that which is for his sons[^h1121]:
###### 28
And it shall be Aaron's[^h175] and his sons'[^h1121] by a statute[^h2706] for ever[^h5769] from the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: for it is an heave offering[^h8641]: and it shall be an heave offering[^h8641] from the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] of the sacrifice[^h2077] of their peace offerings[^h8002], even their heave offering[^h8641] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 29
And the holy[^h6944] garments[^h899] of Aaron[^h175] shall be his sons'[^h1121] after[^h310] him, to be anointed[^h4888] therein, and to be consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] in them.
###### 30
And that son[^h1121] that is priest[^h3548] in his stead shall put[^h3847] them on seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], when he cometh[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] to minister[^h8334] in the holy[^h6944] place. 
###### 31
And thou shalt take[^h3947] the ram[^h352] of the consecration[^h4394], and seethe[^h1310] his flesh[^h1320] in the holy[^h6918] place[^h4725].
###### 32
And Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121] shall eat[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] of the ram[^h352], and the bread[^h3899] that is in the basket[^h5536], by the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150].
###### 33
And they shall eat[^h398] those things wherewith the atonement was made[^h3722], to consecrate[^h4390] [^h3027] and to sanctify[^h6942] them: but a stranger[^h2114] shall not eat[^h398] thereof, because they are holy[^h6944].
###### 34
And if ought of the flesh[^h1320] of the consecrations[^h4394], or of the bread[^h3899], remain[^h3498] unto the morning[^h1242], then thou shalt burn[^h8313] the remainder[^h3498] with fire[^h784]: it shall not be eaten[^h398], because it is holy[^h6944].
###### 35
And thus shalt thou do[^h6213] unto Aaron[^h175], and to his sons[^h1121], according to all things which I have commanded[^h6680] thee: seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shalt thou consecrate[^h4390] [^h3027] them.
###### 36
And thou shalt offer[^h6213] every day[^h3117] a bullock[^h6499] for a sin offering[^h2403] for atonement[^h3725]: and thou shalt cleanse[^h2398] the altar[^h4196], when thou hast made an atonement[^h3722] for it, and thou shalt anoint[^h4886] it, to sanctify[^h6942] it.
###### 37
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] thou shalt make an atonement[^h3722] for the altar[^h4196], and sanctify[^h6942] it; and it shall be an altar[^h4196] most holy[^h6944] [^h6944]: whatsoever toucheth[^h5060] the altar[^h4196] shall be holy[^h6942].
###### 38
Now this is that which thou shalt offer[^h6213] upon the altar[^h4196]; two[^h8147] lambs[^h3532] of the first[^h1121] year[^h8141] day[^h3117] by day[^h3117] continually[^h8548].
###### 39
The one[^h259] lamb[^h3532] thou shalt offer[^h6213] in the morning[^h1242]; and the other[^h8145] lamb[^h3532] thou shalt offer[^h6213] at even[^h6153]:
###### 40
And with the one[^h259] lamb[^h3532] a tenth[^h6241] deal of flour[^h5560] mingled[^h1101] with the fourth part[^h7253] of an hin[^h1969] of beaten[^h3795] oil[^h8081]; and the fourth part[^h7243] of an hin[^h1969] of wine[^h3196] for a drink offering[^h5262].
###### 41
And the other[^h8145] lamb[^h3532] thou shalt offer[^h6213] at even[^h6153], and shalt do[^h6213] thereto according to the meat offering[^h4503] of the morning[^h1242], and according to the drink offering[^h5262] thereof, for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381], an offering made by fire[^h801] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 42
This shall be a continual[^h8548] burnt offering[^h5930] throughout your generations[^h1755] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: where I will meet[^h3259] you, to speak[^h1696] there unto thee.
###### 43
And there I will meet[^h3259] with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and the tabernacle shall be sanctified[^h6942] by my glory[^h3519]. 
###### 44
And I will sanctify[^h6942] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], and the altar[^h4196]: I will sanctify[^h6942] also both Aaron[^h175] and his sons[^h1121], to minister to me in the priest's office[^h3547].
###### 45
And I will dwell[^h7931] among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and will be their God[^h430].
###### 46
And they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], that brought them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], that I may dwell[^h7931] among[^h8432] them: I am the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].

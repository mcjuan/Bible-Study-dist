###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], Depart[^h3212], and go up[^h5927] hence, thou and the people[^h5971] which thou hast brought up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], unto the land[^h776] which I sware[^h7650] unto Abraham[^h85], to Isaac[^h3327], and to Jacob[^h3290], saying[^h559], Unto thy seed[^h2233] will I give[^h5414] it:
###### 2
And I will send[^h7971] an angel[^h4397] before[^h6440] thee; and I will drive out[^h1644] the Canaanite[^h3669], the Amorite[^h567], and the Hittite[^h2850], and the Perizzite[^h6522], the Hivite[^h2340], and the Jebusite[^h2983]:
###### 3
Unto a land[^h776] flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706]: for I will not go up[^h5927] in the midst[^h7130] of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked[^h7186] [^h6203] people[^h5971]: lest I consume[^h3615] thee in the way[^h1870].
###### 4
And when the people[^h5971] heard[^h8085] these evil[^h7451] tidings[^h1697], they mourned[^h56]: and no man[^h376] did put[^h7896] on him his ornaments[^h5716].
###### 5
For the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Say[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Ye are a stiffnecked[^h7186] [^h6203] people[^h5971]: I will come up[^h5927] into the midst[^h7130] of thee in a[^h259] moment[^h7281], and consume[^h3615] thee: therefore now put off[^h3381] thy ornaments[^h5716] from thee, that I may know[^h3045] what to do[^h6213] unto thee.
###### 6
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] stripped[^h5337] themselves of their ornaments[^h5716] by the mount[^h2022] Horeb[^h2722].
###### 7
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] the tabernacle[^h168], and pitched[^h5186] it without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264], afar off[^h7368] from the camp[^h4264], and called[^h7121] it the Tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]. And it came to pass, that every one which sought[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068] went out[^h3318] unto the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150], which was without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264].
###### 8
And it came to pass, when Moses[^h4872] went out[^h3318] unto the tabernacle[^h168], that all the people[^h5971] rose up[^h6965], and stood[^h5324] every man[^h376] at his tent[^h168] door[^h6607], and looked[^h5027] after[^h310] Moses[^h4872], until he was gone[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168].
###### 9
And it came to pass, as Moses[^h4872] entered[^h935] into the tabernacle[^h168], the cloudy[^h6051] pillar[^h5982] descended[^h3381], and stood[^h5975] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168], and the LORD talked[^h1696] with Moses[^h4872].
###### 10
And all the people[^h5971] saw[^h7200] the cloudy[^h6051] pillar[^h5982] stand[^h5975] at the tabernacle[^h168] door[^h6607]: and all the people[^h5971] rose up[^h6965] and worshipped[^h7812], every man[^h376] in his tent[^h168] door[^h6607].
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] face[^h6440] to face[^h6440], as a man[^h376] speaketh[^h1696] unto his friend[^h7453]. And he turned again[^h7725] into the camp[^h4264]: but his servant[^h8334] Joshua[^h3091], the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], a young man[^h5288], departed[^h4185] not out[^h8432] of the tabernacle[^h168].
###### 12
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], See[^h7200], thou sayest[^h559] unto me, Bring up[^h5927] this people[^h5971]: and thou hast not let me know[^h3045] whom thou wilt send[^h7971] with me. Yet thou hast said[^h559], I know[^h3045] thee by name[^h8034], and thou hast also found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in my sight[^h5869].
###### 13
Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], shew[^h3045] me now thy way[^h1870], that I may know[^h3045] thee, that I may find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869]: and consider[^h7200] that this nation[^h1471] is thy people[^h5971].
###### 14
And he said[^h559], My presence[^h6440] shall go[^h3212] with thee, and I will give thee rest[^h5117].
###### 15
And he said[^h559] unto him, If thy presence[^h6440] go[^h1980] not with me, carry us not up[^h5927] hence.
###### 16
For wherein shall it be known[^h3045] here[^h645] that I and thy people[^h5971] have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869]? is it not in that thou goest[^h3212] with us? so shall we be separated[^h6395], I and thy people[^h5971], from all the people[^h5971] that are upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127].
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], I will do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] also that thou hast spoken[^h1696]: for thou hast found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in my sight[^h5869], and I know[^h3045] thee by name[^h8034].
###### 18
And he said[^h559], I beseech thee[^h4994], shew[^h7200] me thy glory[^h3519].
###### 19
And he said[^h559], I will make all my goodness[^h2898] pass[^h5674] before thee, and I will proclaim[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] thee; and will be gracious[^h2603] to whom I will be gracious[^h2603], and will shew mercy[^h7355] on whom I will shew mercy[^h7355].
###### 20
And he said[^h559], Thou canst[^h3201] not see[^h7200] my face[^h6440]: for there shall no man[^h120] see[^h7200] me, and live[^h2425].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Behold, there is a place[^h4725] by me, and thou shalt stand[^h5324] upon a rock[^h6697]:
###### 22
And it shall come to pass, while my glory[^h3519] passeth by[^h5674], that I will put[^h7760] thee in a clift[^h5366] of the rock[^h6697], and will cover[^h5526] thee with my hand[^h3709] while[^h5704] I pass by[^h5674]:
###### 23
And I will take[^h5493] away mine hand[^h3709], and thou shalt see[^h7200] my back parts[^h268]: but my face[^h6440] shall not be seen[^h7200].

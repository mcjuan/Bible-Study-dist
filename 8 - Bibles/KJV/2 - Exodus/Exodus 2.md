###### 1
And there went[^h3212] a man[^h376] of the house[^h1004] of Levi[^h3878], and took[^h3947] to wife a daughter[^h1323] of Levi[^h3878].
###### 2
And the woman[^h802] conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121]: and when she saw[^h7200] him that he was a goodly[^h2896] child, she hid[^h6845] him three[^h7969] months[^h3391].
###### 3
And when she could[^h3201] not longer[^h5750] hide[^h6845] him, she took[^h3947] for him an ark[^h8392] of bulrushes[^h1573], and daubed[^h2560] it with slime[^h2564] and with pitch[^h2203], and put[^h7760] the child[^h3206] therein; and she laid[^h7760] it in the flags[^h5488] by the river's[^h2975] brink[^h8193].
###### 4
And his sister[^h269] stood[^h3320] afar off[^h7350], to wit[^h3045] what would be done[^h6213] to him.
###### 5
And the daughter[^h1323] of Pharaoh[^h6547] came down[^h3381] to wash[^h7364] herself at the river[^h2975]; and her maidens[^h5291] walked[^h1980] along by the river's[^h2975] side[^h3027]; and when she saw[^h7200] the ark[^h8392] among[^h8432] the flags[^h5488], she sent[^h7971] her maid[^h519] to fetch[^h3947] it.
###### 6
And when she had opened[^h6605] it, she saw[^h7200] the child[^h3206]: and, behold, the babe[^h5288] wept[^h1058]. And she had compassion[^h2550] on him, and said[^h559], This is one of the Hebrews'[^h5680] children[^h3206].
###### 7
Then said[^h559] his sister[^h269] to Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323], Shall I go[^h3212] and call[^h7121] to thee a nurse[^h3243] of the Hebrew[^h5680] women[^h802], that she may nurse[^h3243] the child[^h3206] for thee?
###### 8
And Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323] said[^h559] to her, Go[^h3212]. And the maid[^h5959] went[^h3212] and called[^h7121] the child's[^h3206] mother[^h517].
###### 9
And Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323] said[^h559] unto her, Take[^h3212] this child[^h3206] away[^h3212], and nurse[^h3243] it for me, and I will give[^h5414] thee thy wages[^h7939]. And the woman[^h802] took[^h3947] the child[^h3206], and nursed[^h5134] it.
###### 10
And the child[^h3206] grew[^h1431], and she brought[^h935] him unto Pharaoh's[^h6547] daughter[^h1323], and he became her son[^h1121]. And she called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Moses[^h4872]: and she said[^h559], Because I drew[^h4871] him out of the water[^h4325]. 
###### 11
And it came to pass in those days[^h3117], when Moses[^h4872] was grown[^h1431], that he went out[^h3318] unto his brethren[^h251], and looked[^h7200] on their burdens[^h5450]: and he spied[^h7200] an Egyptian[^h4713] [^h376] smiting[^h5221] an Hebrew[^h5680], one of his brethren[^h251].
###### 12
And he looked[^h6437] this way[^h3541] and that way[^h3541], and when he saw[^h7200] that there was no man[^h376], he slew[^h5221] the Egyptian[^h4713], and hid[^h2934] him in the sand[^h2344].
###### 13
And when he went out[^h3318] the second[^h8145] day[^h3117], behold, two[^h8147] men[^h582] of the Hebrews[^h5680] strove[^h5327] together: and he said[^h559] to him that did the wrong[^h7563], Wherefore smitest[^h5221] thou thy fellow[^h7453]?
###### 14
And he said[^h559], Who made[^h7760] thee[^h376] a prince[^h8269] and a judge[^h8199] over us? intendest[^h559] thou to kill[^h2026] me, as thou killedst[^h2026] the Egyptian[^h4713]? And Moses[^h4872] feared[^h3372], and said[^h559], Surely[^h403] this thing[^h1697] is known[^h3045]. 
###### 15
Now when Pharaoh[^h6547] heard[^h8085] this thing[^h1697], he sought[^h1245] to slay[^h2026] Moses[^h4872]. But Moses[^h4872] fled[^h1272] from the face[^h6440] of Pharaoh[^h6547], and dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Midian[^h4080]: and he sat down[^h3427] by a well[^h875].
###### 16
Now the priest[^h3548] of Midian[^h4080] had seven[^h7651] daughters[^h1323]: and they came[^h935] and drew[^h1802] water, and filled[^h4390] the troughs[^h7298] to water[^h8248] their father's[^h1] flock[^h6629]. 
###### 17
And the shepherds[^h7462] came[^h935] and drove them away[^h1644]: but Moses[^h4872] stood up[^h6965] and helped[^h3467] them, and watered[^h8248] their flock[^h6629].
###### 18
And when they came[^h935] to Reuel[^h7467] their father[^h1], he said[^h559], How[^h4069] is it that ye are come[^h935] so soon[^h4116] to day[^h3117]? 
###### 19
And they said[^h559], An Egyptian[^h4713] [^h376] delivered[^h5337] us out of the hand[^h3027] of the shepherds[^h7462], and also drew[^h1802] water enough[^h1802] for us, and watered[^h8248] the flock[^h6629].
###### 20
And he said[^h559] unto his daughters[^h1323], And where is he? why is it that ye have left[^h5800] the man[^h376]? call[^h7121] him, that he may eat[^h398] bread[^h3899].
###### 21
And Moses[^h4872] was content[^h2974] to dwell[^h3427] with the man[^h376]: and he gave[^h5414] Moses[^h4872] Zipporah[^h6855] his daughter[^h1323].
###### 22
And she bare[^h3205] him a son[^h1121], and he called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Gershom[^h1647]: for he said[^h559], I have been a stranger[^h1616] in a strange[^h5237] land[^h776]. 
###### 23
And it came to pass in process[^h1992] [^h7227] of time[^h3117], that the king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] died[^h4191]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] sighed[^h584] by reason of[^h4480] the bondage[^h5656], and they cried[^h2199], and their cry[^h7775] came up[^h5927] unto God[^h430] by reason of the bondage[^h5656].
###### 24
And God[^h430] heard[^h8085] their groaning[^h5009], and God[^h430] remembered[^h2142] his covenant[^h1285] with Abraham[^h85], with Isaac[^h3327], and with Jacob[^h3290].
###### 25
And God[^h430] looked[^h7200] upon the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and God[^h430] had respect[^h3045] unto them.

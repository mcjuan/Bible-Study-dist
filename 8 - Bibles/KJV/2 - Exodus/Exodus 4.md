###### 1
And Moses[^h4872] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], But, behold, they will not believe[^h539] me, nor hearken[^h8085] unto my voice[^h6963]: for they will say[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] hath not appeared[^h7200] unto thee.
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, What is that in thine hand[^h3027]? And he said[^h559], A rod[^h4294].
###### 3
And he said[^h559], Cast[^h7993] it on the ground[^h776]. And he cast[^h7993] it on the ground[^h776], and it became a serpent[^h5175]; and Moses[^h4872] fled[^h5127] from before[^h6440] it.
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], Put forth[^h7971] thine hand[^h3027], and take[^h270] it by the tail[^h2180]. And he put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and caught[^h2388] it, and it became a rod[^h4294] in his hand[^h3709]:
###### 5
That they may believe[^h539] that the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], the God[^h430] of Abraham[^h85], the God[^h430] of Isaac[^h3327], and the God[^h430] of Jacob[^h3290], hath appeared[^h7200] unto thee.
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] furthermore[^h5750] unto him, Put[^h935] now thine hand[^h3027] into thy bosom[^h2436]. And he put[^h935] his hand[^h3027] into his bosom[^h2436]: and when he took[^h3318] it out, behold, his hand[^h3027] was leprous[^h6879] as snow[^h7950].
###### 7
And he said[^h559], Put[^h7725] thine hand[^h3027] into thy bosom[^h2436] again[^h7725]. And he put[^h7725] his hand[^h3027] into his bosom[^h2436] again[^h7725]; and plucked[^h3318] it out of his bosom[^h2436], and, behold, it was turned again[^h7725] as his other flesh[^h1320].
###### 8
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe[^h539] thee, neither hearken[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of the first[^h7223] sign[^h226], that they will believe[^h539] the voice[^h6963] of the latter[^h314] sign[^h226].
###### 9
And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe[^h539] also these two[^h8147] signs[^h226], neither hearken[^h8085] unto thy voice[^h6963], that thou shalt take[^h3947] of the water[^h4325] of the river[^h2975], and pour[^h8210] it upon the dry[^h3004] land: and the water[^h4325] which thou takest[^h3947] out of the river[^h2975] shall become blood[^h1818] upon the dry[^h3006] land. 
###### 10
And Moses[^h4872] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], O[^h994] my Lord[^h136], I[^h376] am not eloquent[^h1697], neither heretofore[^h8032] [^h8543], nor since[^h227] thou hast spoken[^h1696] unto thy servant[^h5650]: but I am slow[^h3515] of speech[^h6310], and of a slow[^h3515] tongue[^h3956].  
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Who hath made[^h7760] man's[^h120] mouth[^h6310]? or who maketh[^h7760] the dumb[^h483], or deaf[^h2795], or the seeing[^h6493], or the blind[^h5787]? have not I the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 12
Now therefore go[^h3212], and I will be with thy mouth[^h6310], and teach[^h3384] thee what thou shalt say[^h1696].
###### 13
And he said[^h559], O[^h994] my Lord[^h136], send[^h7971], I pray thee, by the hand[^h3027] of him whom thou wilt send[^h7971]. 
###### 14
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against Moses[^h4872], and he said[^h559], Is not Aaron[^h175] the Levite[^h3881] thy brother[^h251]? I know[^h3045] that he can speak[^h1696] well[^h1696]. And also, behold, he cometh forth[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] thee: and when he seeth[^h7200] thee, he will be glad[^h8055] in his heart[^h3820].
###### 15
And thou shalt speak[^h1696] unto him, and put[^h7760] words[^h1697] in his mouth[^h6310]: and I will be with thy mouth[^h6310], and with his mouth[^h6310], and will teach[^h3384] you what ye shall do[^h6213].
###### 16
And he shall be thy spokesman[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971]: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth[^h6310], and thou shalt be to him instead of God[^h430].
###### 17
And thou shalt take[^h3947] this rod[^h4294] in thine hand[^h3027], wherewith thou shalt do[^h6213] signs[^h226].
###### 18
And Moses[^h4872] went[^h3212] and returned[^h7725] to Jethro[^h3500] his father in law[^h2859], and said[^h559] unto him, Let me go[^h3212], I pray thee, and return[^h7725] unto my brethren[^h251] which are in Egypt[^h4714], and see[^h7200] whether they be yet[^h5750] alive[^h2416]. And Jethro[^h3503] said[^h559] to Moses[^h4872], Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965]. 
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872] in Midian[^h4080], Go[^h3212], return[^h7725] into Egypt[^h4714]: for all the men[^h582] are dead[^h4191] which sought[^h1245] thy life[^h5315].
###### 20
And Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] his wife[^h802] and his sons[^h1121], and set[^h7392] them upon an ass[^h2543], and he returned[^h7725] to the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: and Moses[^h4872] took[^h3947] the rod[^h4294] of God[^h430] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Moses[^h4872], When thou goest[^h3212] to return[^h7725] into Egypt[^h4714], see[^h7200] that thou do[^h6213] all those wonders[^h4159] before[^h6440] Pharaoh[^h6547], which I have put[^h7760] in thine hand[^h3027]: but I will harden[^h2388] his heart[^h3820], that he shall not let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971].
###### 22
And thou shalt say[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Israel[^h3478] is my son[^h1121], even my firstborn[^h1060]:
###### 23
And I say[^h559] unto thee, Let my son[^h1121] go[^h7971], that he may serve[^h5647] me: and if thou refuse[^h3985] to let him go[^h7971], behold, I will slay[^h2026] thy son[^h1121], even thy firstborn[^h1060].
###### 24
And it came to pass by the way[^h1870] in the inn[^h4411], that the LORD[^h3068] met[^h6298] him, and sought[^h1245] to kill[^h4191] him.
###### 25
Then Zipporah[^h6855] took[^h3947] a sharp stone[^h6864], and cut off[^h3772] the foreskin[^h6190] of her son[^h1121], and cast[^h5060] it at his feet[^h7272], and said[^h559], Surely a bloody[^h1818] husband[^h2860] art thou to me.  
###### 26
So he let him go[^h7503]: then she said[^h559], A bloody[^h1818] husband[^h2860] thou art, because of the circumcision[^h4139].
###### 27
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to Aaron[^h175], Go[^h3212] into the wilderness[^h4057] to meet[^h7125] Moses[^h4872]. And he went[^h3212], and met[^h6298] him in the mount[^h2022] of God[^h430], and kissed[^h5401] him.
###### 28
And Moses[^h4872] told[^h5046] Aaron[^h175] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] who had sent[^h7971] him, and all the signs[^h226] which he had commanded[^h6680] him.
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175] went[^h3212] and gathered together[^h622] all the elders[^h2205] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 30
And Aaron[^h175] spake[^h1696] all the words[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] had spoken[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872], and did[^h6213] the signs[^h226] in the sight[^h5869] of the people[^h5971].
###### 31
And the people[^h5971] believed[^h539]: and when they heard[^h8085] that the LORD[^h3068] had visited[^h6485] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and that he had looked[^h7200] upon their affliction[^h6040], then they bowed their heads[^h6915] and worshipped[^h7812].

###### 1
There was also a lot[^h1486] for the tribe[^h4294] of Manasseh[^h4519]; for he was the firstborn[^h1060] of Joseph[^h3130]; to wit, for Machir[^h4353] the firstborn[^h1060] of Manasseh[^h4519], the father[^h1] of Gilead[^h1568]: because he was a man[^h376] of war[^h4421], therefore he had Gilead[^h1568] and Bashan[^h1316].
###### 2
There was also a lot for the rest[^h3498] of the children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] by their families[^h4940]; for the children[^h1121] of Abiezer[^h44], and for the children[^h1121] of Helek[^h2507], and for the children[^h1121] of Asriel[^h844], and for the children[^h1121] of Shechem[^h7928], and for the children[^h1121] of Hepher[^h2660], and for the children[^h1121] of Shemida[^h8061]: these were the male[^h2145] children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] the son[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] by their families[^h4940].
###### 3
But Zelophehad[^h6765], the son[^h1121] of Hepher[^h2660], the son[^h1121] of Gilead[^h1568], the son[^h1121] of Machir[^h4353], the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519], had no sons[^h1121], but daughters[^h1323]: and these are the names[^h8034] of his daughters[^h1323], Mahlah[^h4244], and Noah[^h5270], Hoglah[^h2295], Milcah[^h4435], and Tirzah[^h8656].
###### 4
And they came near[^h7126] before[^h6440] Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and before[^h6440] Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], and before[^h6440] the princes[^h5387], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] to give[^h5414] us an inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] our brethren[^h251]. Therefore according to the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] he gave[^h5414] them an inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] the brethren[^h251] of their father[^h1].
###### 5
And there fell[^h5307] ten[^h6235] portions[^h2256] to Manasseh[^h4519], beside the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568] and Bashan[^h1316], which were on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383];
###### 6
Because the daughters[^h1323] of Manasseh[^h4519] had[^h5157] an inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] his sons[^h1121]: and the rest[^h3498] of Manasseh's[^h4519] sons[^h1121] had the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 7
And the coast[^h1366] of Manasseh[^h4519] was from Asher[^h836] to Michmethah[^h4366], that lieth before[^h6440] Shechem[^h7927]; and the border[^h1366] went along[^h1980] on the right hand[^h3225] unto the inhabitants[^h3427] of Entappuah[^h5887].
###### 8
Now Manasseh[^h4519] had the land[^h776] of Tappuah[^h8599]: but Tappuah[^h8599] on the border[^h1366] of Manasseh[^h4519] belonged to the children[^h1121] of Ephraim[^h669];
###### 9
And the coast[^h1366] descended[^h3381] unto the river[^h5158] Kanah[^h7071], southward[^h5045] of the river[^h5158]: these cities[^h5892] of Ephraim[^h669] are among[^h8432] the cities[^h5892] of Manasseh[^h4519]: the coast[^h1366] of Manasseh[^h4519] also was on the north side[^h6828] of the river[^h5158], and the outgoings[^h8444] of it were at the sea[^h3220]: 
###### 10
Southward[^h5045] it was Ephraim's[^h669], and northward[^h6828] it was Manasseh's[^h4519], and the sea[^h3220] is his border[^h1366]; and they met together[^h6293] in Asher[^h836] on the north[^h6828], and in Issachar[^h3485] on the east[^h4217].
###### 11
And Manasseh[^h4519] had in Issachar[^h3485] and in Asher[^h836] Bethshean[^h1052] and her towns[^h1323], and Ibleam[^h2991] and her towns[^h1323], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Dor[^h1756] and her towns[^h1323], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Endor[^h5874] and her towns[^h1323], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Taanach[^h8590] and her towns[^h1323], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Megiddo[^h4023] and her towns[^h1323], even three[^h7969] countries[^h5316].
###### 12
Yet the children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] could[^h3201] not drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants of those cities[^h5892]; but the Canaanites[^h3669] would[^h2974] dwell[^h3427] in that land[^h776].
###### 13
Yet it came to pass, when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were waxen strong[^h2388], that they put[^h5414] the Canaanites[^h3669] to tribute[^h4522]; but did not utterly[^h3423] drive them out[^h3423].
###### 14
And the children[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] spake[^h1696] unto Joshua[^h3091], saying[^h559], Why hast thou given[^h5414] me but one[^h259] lot[^h1486] and one[^h259] portion[^h2256] to inherit[^h5159], seeing I am a great[^h7227] people[^h5971], forasmuch as[^h5704] the LORD[^h3068] hath blessed[^h1288] me hitherto[^h3541]?
###### 15
And Joshua[^h3091] answered[^h559] them, If thou be a great[^h7227] people[^h5971], then get thee up[^h5927] to the wood[^h3293] country, and cut down[^h1254] for thyself there in the land[^h776] of the Perizzites[^h6522] and of the giants[^h7497], if mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669] be too narrow[^h213] for thee. 
###### 16
And the children[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] said[^h559], The hill[^h2022] is not enough[^h4672] for us: and all the Canaanites[^h3669] that dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of the valley[^h6010] have chariots[^h7393] of iron[^h1270], both they who are of Bethshean[^h1052] and her towns[^h1323], and they who are of the valley[^h6010] of Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 17
And Joshua[^h3091] spake[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130], even to Ephraim[^h669] and to Manasseh[^h4519], saying[^h559], Thou art a great[^h7227] people[^h5971], and hast great[^h1419] power[^h3581]: thou shalt not have one[^h259] lot[^h1486] only:
###### 18
But the mountain[^h2022] shall be thine; for it is a wood[^h3293], and thou shalt cut it down[^h1254]: and the outgoings[^h8444] of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out[^h3423] the Canaanites[^h3669], though they have iron[^h1270] chariots[^h7393], and though they be strong[^h2389].

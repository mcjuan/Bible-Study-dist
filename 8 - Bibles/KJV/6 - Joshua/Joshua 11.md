###### 1
And it came to pass, when Jabin[^h2985] king[^h4428] of Hazor[^h2674] had heard[^h8085] those things, that he sent[^h7971] to Jobab[^h3103] king[^h4428] of Madon[^h4068], and to the king[^h4428] of Shimron[^h8110], and to the king[^h4428] of Achshaph[^h407],
###### 2
And to the kings[^h4428] that were on the north[^h6828] of the mountains[^h2022], and of the plains[^h6160] south[^h5045] of Chinneroth[^h3672], and in the valley[^h8219], and in the borders[^h5299] of Dor[^h1756] on the west[^h3220],
###### 3
And to the Canaanite[^h3669] on the east[^h4217] and on the west[^h3220], and to the Amorite[^h567], and the Hittite[^h2850], and the Perizzite[^h6522], and the Jebusite[^h2983] in the mountains[^h2022], and to the Hivite[^h2340] under Hermon[^h2768] in the land[^h776] of Mizpeh[^h4709].
###### 4
And they went out[^h3318], they and all their hosts[^h4264] with them, much[^h7227] people[^h5971], even as the sand[^h2344] that is upon the sea[^h3220] shore[^h8193] in multitude[^h7230], with horses[^h5483] and chariots[^h7393] very[^h3966] many[^h7227].
###### 5
And when all these kings[^h4428] were met together[^h3259], they came[^h935] and pitched[^h2583] together[^h3162] at the waters[^h4325] of Merom[^h4792], to fight[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Be not afraid[^h3372] because[^h6440] of them: for to morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256] will I deliver them up[^h5414] all slain[^h2491] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478]: thou shalt hough[^h6131] their horses[^h5483], and burn[^h8313] their chariots[^h4818] with fire[^h784].
###### 7
So Joshua[^h3091] came[^h935], and all the people[^h5971] of war[^h4421] with him, against them by the waters[^h4325] of Merom[^h4792] suddenly[^h6597]; and they fell upon[^h5307] them.
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478], who smote[^h5221] them, and chased[^h7291] them unto great[^h7227] Zidon[^h6721], and unto Misrephothmaim[^h4956], and unto the valley[^h1237] of Mizpeh[^h4708] eastward[^h4217]; and they smote[^h5221] them, until they left[^h7604] them none remaining[^h8300].  
###### 9
And Joshua[^h3091] did[^h6213] unto them as the LORD[^h3068] bade[^h559] him: he houghed[^h6131] their horses[^h5483], and burnt[^h8313] their chariots[^h4818] with fire[^h784].
###### 10
And Joshua[^h3091] at that time[^h6256] turned back[^h7725], and took[^h3920] Hazor[^h2674], and smote[^h5221] the king[^h4428] thereof with the sword[^h2719]: for Hazor[^h2674] beforetime[^h6440] was the head[^h7218] of all those kingdoms[^h4467].
###### 11
And they smote[^h5221] all the souls[^h5315] that were therein with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], utterly destroying[^h2763] them: there was not any left[^h3498] to breathe[^h5397]: and he burnt[^h8313] Hazor[^h2674] with fire[^h784]. 
###### 12
And all the cities[^h5892] of those kings[^h4428], and all the kings[^h4428] of them, did Joshua[^h3091] take[^h3920], and smote[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and he utterly destroyed[^h2763] them, as Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680].
###### 13
But as for the cities[^h5892] that stood[^h5975] still in their strength[^h8510], Israel[^h3478] burned[^h8313] none of them, save[^h2108] Hazor[^h2674] only; that did Joshua[^h3091] burn[^h8313]. 
###### 14
And all the spoil[^h7998] of these cities[^h5892], and the cattle[^h929], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] took for a prey[^h962] unto themselves; but every man[^h120] they smote[^h5221] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], until they had destroyed[^h8045] them, neither left[^h7604] they any to breathe[^h5397].
###### 15
As the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872] his servant[^h5650], so did Moses[^h4872] command[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091], and so did[^h6213] Joshua[^h3091]; he left[^h5493] nothing[^h1697] undone[^h5493] of all that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872]. 
###### 16
So Joshua[^h3091] took[^h3947] all that land[^h776], the hills[^h2022], and all the south country[^h5045], and all the land[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657], and the valley[^h8219], and the plain[^h6160], and the mountain[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], and the valley[^h8219] of the same;
###### 17
Even from the mount[^h2022] Halak[^h2510], that goeth up[^h5927] to Seir[^h8165], even unto Baalgad[^h1171] in the valley[^h1237] of Lebanon[^h3844] under mount[^h2022] Hermon[^h2768]: and all their kings[^h4428] he took[^h3920], and smote[^h5221] them, and slew[^h4191] them. 
###### 18
Joshua[^h3091] made[^h6213] war[^h4421] a long[^h7227] time[^h3117] with all those kings[^h4428].
###### 19
There was not a city[^h5892] that made peace[^h7999] with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], save the Hivites[^h2340] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gibeon[^h1391]: all other they took[^h3947] in battle[^h4421].
###### 20
For it was of the LORD[^h3068] to harden[^h2388] their hearts[^h3820], that they should come against[^h7125] Israel[^h3478] in battle[^h4421], that he might destroy them utterly[^h2763], and that they might have no favour[^h8467], but that he might destroy[^h8045] them, as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872].
###### 21
And at that time[^h6256] came[^h935] Joshua[^h3091], and cut off[^h3772] the Anakims[^h6062] from the mountains[^h2022], from Hebron[^h2275], from Debir[^h1688], from Anab[^h6024], and from all the mountains[^h2022] of Judah[^h3063], and from all the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478]: Joshua[^h3091] destroyed them utterly[^h2763] with their cities[^h5892].
###### 22
There was none of the Anakims[^h6062] left[^h3498] in the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: only in Gaza[^h5804], in Gath[^h1661], and in Ashdod[^h795], there remained[^h7604].
###### 23
So Joshua[^h3091] took[^h3947] the whole land[^h776], according to all that the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872]; and Joshua[^h3091] gave[^h5414] it for an inheritance[^h5159] unto Israel[^h3478] according to their divisions[^h4256] by their tribes[^h7626]. And the land[^h776] rested[^h8252] from war[^h4421].

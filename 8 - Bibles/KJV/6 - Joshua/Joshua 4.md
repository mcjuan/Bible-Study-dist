###### 1
And it came to pass, when all the people[^h1471] were clean[^h8552] passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], that the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Take[^h3947] you twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] men[^h582] out of the people[^h5971], out of every[^h259] tribe[^h7626] a man[^h376],
###### 3
And command[^h6680] ye them, saying[^h559], Take[^h5375] you hence out of the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], out of the place where the priests'[^h3548] feet[^h7272] stood[^h4673] firm[^h3559], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] stones[^h68], and ye shall carry them over[^h5674] with you, and leave[^h3240] them in the lodging place[^h4411], where ye shall lodge[^h3885] this night[^h3915].
###### 4
Then Joshua[^h3091] called[^h7121] the twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] men[^h376], whom he had prepared[^h3559] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], out of every[^h259] tribe[^h7626] a man[^h376]:
###### 5
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto them, Pass over[^h5674] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] into the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], and take ye up[^h7311] every[^h259] man[^h376] of you a stone[^h68] upon his shoulder[^h7926], according unto the number[^h4557] of the tribes[^h7626] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 6
That this may be a sign[^h226] among[^h7130] you, that when your children[^h1121] ask[^h7592] their fathers in time to come[^h4279], saying[^h559], What mean ye by these stones[^h68]? 
###### 7
Then ye shall answer[^h559] them, That the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] were cut off[^h3772] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068]; when it passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] were cut off[^h3772]: and these stones[^h68] shall be for a memorial[^h2146] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 8
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] so as Joshua[^h3091] commanded[^h6680], and took up[^h5375] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] stones[^h68] out of the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], as the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] unto Joshua[^h3091], according to the number[^h4557] of the tribes[^h7626] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and carried them over[^h5674] with them unto the place where they lodged[^h4411], and laid them down[^h3240] there.
###### 9
And Joshua[^h3091] set up[^h6965] twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] stones[^h68] in the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], in the place where the feet[^h7272] of the priests[^h3548] which bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] stood[^h4673]: and they are there unto this day[^h3117].
###### 10
For the priests[^h3548] which bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] stood[^h5975] in the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], until every thing[^h1697] was finished[^h8552] that the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091] to speak[^h1696] unto the people[^h5971], according to all that Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091]: and the people[^h5971] hasted[^h4116] and passed over[^h5674].
###### 11
And it came to pass, when all the people[^h5971] were clean[^h8552] passed over[^h5674], that the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] passed over[^h5674], and the priests[^h3548], in the presence[^h6440] of the people[^h5971].
###### 12
And the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], and half[^h2677] the tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], passed over[^h5674] armed[^h2571] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], as Moses[^h4872] spake[^h1696] unto them:
###### 13
About forty[^h705] thousand[^h505] prepared[^h2502] for war[^h6635] passed over[^h5674] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] unto battle[^h4421], to the plains[^h6160] of Jericho[^h3405]. 
###### 14
On that day[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] magnified[^h1431] Joshua[^h3091] in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478]; and they feared[^h3372] him, as they feared[^h3372] Moses[^h4872], all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], saying[^h559],
###### 16
Command[^h6680] the priests[^h3548] that bear[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the testimony[^h5715], that they come up[^h5927] out of Jordan[^h3383].
###### 17
Joshua[^h3091] therefore commanded[^h6680] the priests[^h3548], saying[^h559], Come ye up[^h5927] out of Jordan[^h3383].
###### 18
And it came to pass, when the priests[^h3548] that bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] were come up[^h5927] out of the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], and the soles[^h3709] of the priests'[^h3548] feet[^h7272] were lifted up[^h5423] unto the dry land[^h2724], that the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] returned[^h7725] unto their place[^h4725], and flowed[^h3212] over all his banks[^h1415], as[^h8543] they did before[^h8032].  
###### 19
And the people[^h5971] came up[^h5927] out of Jordan[^h3383] on the tenth[^h6218] day of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], and encamped[^h2583] in Gilgal[^h1537], in the east[^h4217] border[^h7097] of Jericho[^h3405].
###### 20
And those twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] stones[^h68], which they took out[^h3947] of Jordan[^h3383], did Joshua[^h3091] pitch[^h6965] in Gilgal[^h1537].
###### 21
And he spake[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], When your children[^h1121] shall ask[^h7592] their fathers[^h1] in time to come[^h4279], saying[^h559], What mean these stones[^h68]? 
###### 22
Then ye shall let your children[^h1121] know[^h3045], saying[^h559], Israel[^h3478] came over[^h5674] this Jordan[^h3383] on dry land[^h3004].
###### 23
For the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] dried up[^h3001] the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] from before[^h6440] you, until ye were passed over[^h5674], as the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] did[^h6213] to the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], which he dried up[^h3001] from before[^h6440] us, until we were gone over[^h5674]:
###### 24
That all the people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776] might know[^h3045] the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068], that it is mighty[^h2389]: that ye might fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] for ever[^h3117].

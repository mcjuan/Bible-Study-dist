###### 1
And it came to pass, when all the kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which were on the side[^h5676] of Jordan[^h3383] westward[^h3220], and all the kings[^h4428] of the Canaanites[^h3669], which were by the sea[^h3220], heard[^h8085] that the LORD[^h3068] had dried up[^h3001] the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] from before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], until we were passed over[^h5674], that their heart[^h3824] melted[^h4549], neither was there spirit[^h7307] in them any more, because[^h6440] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
At that time[^h6256] the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Make[^h6213] thee sharp[^h6697] knives[^h2719], and circumcise[^h4135] again[^h7725] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] the second time[^h8145]. 
###### 3
And Joshua[^h3091] made[^h6213] him sharp[^h6697] knives[^h2719], and circumcised[^h4135] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] at the hill[^h1389] of the foreskins[^h6190].  
###### 4
And this is the cause[^h1697] why Joshua[^h3091] did circumcise[^h4135]: All the people[^h5971] that came out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714], that were males[^h2145], even all the men[^h582] of war[^h4421], died[^h4191] in the wilderness[^h4057] by the way[^h1870], after they came out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
Now[^h3588] all the people[^h5971] that came out[^h3318] were circumcised[^h4135]: but all the people[^h5971] that were born[^h3209] in the wilderness[^h4057] by the way[^h1870] as they came forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714], them they had not circumcised[^h4135].
###### 6
For the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] walked[^h1980] forty[^h705] years[^h8141] in the wilderness[^h4057], till all the people[^h1471] that were men[^h582] of war[^h4421], which came out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714], were consumed[^h8552], because they obeyed[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068]: unto whom the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] that he would not shew[^h7200] them the land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] sware[^h7650] unto their fathers[^h1] that he would give[^h5414] us, a land[^h776] that floweth[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706].
###### 7
And their children[^h1121], whom he raised up[^h6965] in their stead, them Joshua[^h3091] circumcised[^h4135]: for they were uncircumcised[^h6189], because they had not circumcised[^h4135] them by the way[^h1870].
###### 8
And it came to pass, when they had done[^h8552] circumcising[^h4135] all the people[^h1471], that they abode[^h3427] in their places in the camp[^h4264], till they were whole[^h2421]. 
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], This day[^h3117] have I rolled away[^h1556] the reproach[^h2781] of Egypt[^h4714] from off you. Wherefore the name[^h8034] of the place[^h4725] is called[^h7121] Gilgal[^h1537] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 10
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] encamped[^h2583] in Gilgal[^h1537], and kept[^h6213] the passover[^h6453] on the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320] at even[^h6153] in the plains[^h6160] of Jericho[^h3405].
###### 11
And they did eat[^h398] of the old corn[^h5669] of the land[^h776] on the morrow[^h4283] after the passover[^h6453], unleavened cakes[^h4682], and parched[^h7033] corn in the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117].
###### 12
And the manna[^h4478] ceased[^h7673] on the morrow[^h4283] after they had eaten[^h398] of the old corn[^h5669] of the land[^h776]; neither had the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] manna[^h4478] any more; but they did eat[^h398] of the fruit[^h8393] of the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] that year[^h8141].
###### 13
And it came to pass, when Joshua[^h3091] was by Jericho[^h3405], that he lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869] and looked[^h7200], and, behold, there stood[^h5975] a man[^h376] over against him with his sword[^h2719] drawn[^h8025] in his hand[^h3027]: and Joshua[^h3091] went[^h3212] unto him, and said[^h559] unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries[^h6862]?
###### 14
And he said[^h559], Nay; but as captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of the LORD[^h3068] am I now come[^h935]. And Joshua[^h3091] fell[^h5307] on his face[^h6440] to the earth[^h776], and did worship[^h7812], and said[^h559] unto him, What saith[^h1696] my lord[^h113] unto his servant[^h5650]? 
###### 15
And the captain[^h8269] of the LORD'S[^h3068] host[^h6635] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Loose[^h5394] thy shoe[^h5275] from off thy foot[^h7272]; for the place[^h4725] whereon thou standest[^h5975] is holy[^h6944]. And Joshua[^h3091] did[^h6213] so.

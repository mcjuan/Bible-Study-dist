###### 1
And it came to pass a long[^h7227] time[^h3117] after[^h310] that the LORD[^h3068] had given rest[^h5117] unto Israel[^h3478] from all their enemies[^h341] round about[^h5439], that Joshua[^h3091] waxed old[^h2204] and stricken[^h935] in age[^h3117]. 
###### 2
And Joshua[^h3091] called[^h7121] for all Israel[^h3478], and for their elders[^h2205], and for their heads[^h7218], and for their judges[^h8199], and for their officers[^h7860], and said[^h559] unto them, I am old[^h2204] and stricken[^h935] in age[^h3117]:
###### 3
And ye have seen[^h7200] all that the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath done[^h6213] unto all these nations[^h1471] because[^h6440] of you; for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] is he that hath fought[^h3898] for you.
###### 4
Behold[^h7200], I have divided[^h5307] unto you by lot these nations[^h1471] that remain[^h7604], to be an inheritance[^h5159] for your tribes[^h7626], from Jordan[^h3383], with all the nations[^h1471] that I have cut off[^h3772], even unto the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220] westward[^h3996] [^h8121]. 
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], he shall expel[^h1920] them from before[^h6440] you, and drive[^h3423] them from out of your sight[^h6440]; and ye shall possess[^h3423] their land[^h776], as the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath promised[^h1696] unto you.
###### 6
Be ye therefore very[^h3966] courageous[^h2388] to keep[^h8104] and to do[^h6213] all that is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], that ye turn[^h5493] not aside therefrom to the right hand[^h3225] or to the left[^h8040];
###### 7
That ye come[^h935] not among these nations[^h1471], these that remain[^h7604] among you; neither make mention[^h2142] of the name[^h8034] of their gods[^h430], nor cause to swear[^h7650] by them, neither serve[^h5647] them, nor bow[^h7812] yourselves unto them:
###### 8
But cleave[^h1692] unto the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], as ye have done[^h6213] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 9
For the LORD[^h3068] hath driven out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] you great[^h1419] nations[^h1471] and strong[^h6099]: but as for you, no man[^h376] hath been able to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] you unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 10
One[^h259] man[^h376] of you shall chase[^h7291] a thousand[^h505]: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], he it is that fighteth[^h3898] for you, as he hath promised[^h1696] you.
###### 11
Take good[^h3966] heed[^h8104] therefore unto yourselves[^h5315], that ye love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]. 
###### 12
Else if ye do in any wise[^h7725] go back[^h7725], and cleave[^h1692] unto the remnant[^h3499] of these nations[^h1471], even these that remain[^h7604] among you, and shall make marriages[^h2859] with them, and go in[^h935] unto them, and they to you:
###### 13
Know[^h3045] for a certainty[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] will no more[^h3254] drive out[^h3423] any of these nations[^h1471] from before[^h6440] you; but they shall be snares[^h6341] and traps[^h4170] unto you, and scourges[^h7850] in your sides[^h6654], and thorns[^h6796] in your eyes[^h5869], until ye perish[^h6] from off this good[^h2896] land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] you.
###### 14
And, behold, this day[^h3117] I am going[^h1980] the way[^h1870] of all the earth[^h776]: and ye know[^h3045] in all your hearts[^h3824] and in all your souls[^h5315], that not one[^h259] thing[^h1697] hath failed[^h5307] of all the good[^h2896] things[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] spake[^h1696] concerning you; all are come to pass[^h935] unto you, and not one[^h259] thing[^h1697] hath failed[^h5307] thereof.
###### 15
Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good[^h2896] things[^h1697] are come[^h935] upon you, which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] promised[^h1696] you; so shall the LORD[^h3068] bring[^h935] upon you all evil[^h7451] things[^h1697], until he have destroyed[^h8045] you from off this good[^h2896] land[^h127] which the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] you.
###### 16
When ye have transgressed[^h5674] the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], which he commanded[^h6680] you, and have gone[^h1980] and served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and bowed[^h7812] yourselves to them; then shall the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] be kindled[^h2734] against you, and ye shall perish[^h6] quickly[^h4120] from off the good[^h2896] land[^h776] which he hath given[^h5414] unto you.

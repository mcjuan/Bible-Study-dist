###### 1
And Joshua[^h3091] gathered[^h622] all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to Shechem[^h7927], and called[^h7121] for the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and for their heads[^h7218], and for their judges[^h8199], and for their officers[^h7860]; and they presented[^h3320] themselves before[^h6440] God[^h430].
###### 2
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Your fathers[^h1] dwelt[^h3427] on the other side[^h5676] of the flood[^h5104] in old time[^h5769], even Terah[^h8646], the father[^h1] of Abraham[^h85], and the father[^h1] of Nachor[^h5152]: and they served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 3
And I took[^h3947] your father[^h1] Abraham[^h85] from the other side[^h5676] of the flood[^h5104], and led[^h3212] him throughout all the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], and multiplied[^h7235] his seed[^h2233], and gave[^h5414] him Isaac[^h3327].
###### 4
And I gave[^h5414] unto Isaac[^h3327] Jacob[^h3290] and Esau[^h6215]: and I gave[^h5414] unto Esau[^h6215] mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], to possess[^h3423] it; but Jacob[^h3290] and his children[^h1121] went down[^h3381] into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
I sent[^h7971] Moses[^h4872] also and Aaron[^h175], and I plagued[^h5062] Egypt[^h4714], according to that which[^h834] I did[^h6213] among[^h7130] them: and afterward[^h310] I brought you out[^h3318].
###### 6
And I brought[^h3318] your fathers[^h1] out of Egypt[^h4714]: and ye came[^h935] unto the sea[^h3220]; and the Egyptians[^h4714] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] your fathers[^h1] with chariots[^h7393] and horsemen[^h6571] unto the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 7
And when they cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068], he put[^h7760] darkness[^h3990] between you and the Egyptians[^h4713], and brought[^h935] the sea[^h3220] upon them, and covered[^h3680] them; and your eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200] what I have done[^h6213] in Egypt[^h4714]: and ye dwelt[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057] a long[^h7227] season[^h3117].
###### 8
And I brought[^h935] you into the land[^h776] of the Amorites[^h567], which dwelt[^h3427] on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]; and they fought[^h3898] with you: and I gave[^h5414] them into your hand[^h3027], that ye might possess[^h3423] their land[^h776]; and I destroyed[^h8045] them from before[^h6440] you.
###### 9
Then Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834], king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], arose[^h6965] and warred[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478], and sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] Balaam[^h1109] the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160] to curse[^h7043] you:
###### 10
But I would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto Balaam[^h1109]; therefore he blessed[^h1288] you still[^h1288]: so I delivered[^h5337] you out of his hand[^h3027].
###### 11
And ye went over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and came[^h935] unto Jericho[^h3405]: and the men[^h1167] of Jericho[^h3405] fought[^h3898] against you, the Amorites[^h567], and the Perizzites[^h6522], and the Canaanites[^h3669], and the Hittites[^h2850], and the Girgashites[^h1622], the Hivites[^h2340], and the Jebusites[^h2983]; and I delivered[^h5414] them into your hand[^h3027].
###### 12
And I sent[^h7971] the hornet[^h6880] before[^h6440] you, which drave them out[^h1644] from before[^h6440] you, even the two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567]; but not with thy sword[^h2719], nor with thy bow[^h7198].
###### 13
And I have given[^h5414] you a land[^h776] for which ye did not labour[^h3021], and cities[^h5892] which ye built[^h1129] not, and ye dwell[^h3427] in them; of the vineyards[^h3754] and oliveyards[^h2132] which ye planted[^h5193] not do ye eat[^h398].
###### 14
Now therefore fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068], and serve[^h5647] him in sincerity[^h8549] and in truth[^h571]: and put away[^h5493] the gods[^h430] which your fathers[^h1] served[^h5647] on the other side[^h5676] of the flood[^h5104], and in Egypt[^h4714]; and serve[^h5647] ye the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
And if it seem evil[^h7489] unto you[^h4310] to serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068], choose[^h977] you this day[^h3117] whom[^h5869] ye will serve[^h5647]; whether the gods[^h430] which your fathers[^h1] served[^h5647] that were on the other side[^h5676] of the flood[^h5104], or the gods[^h430] of the Amorites[^h567], in whose land[^h776] ye dwell[^h3427]: but as for me and my house[^h1004], we will serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And the people[^h5971] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], God forbid[^h2486] that we should forsake[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], to serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430];
###### 17
For the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], he it is that brought us up[^h5927] and our fathers[^h1] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from the house[^h1004] of bondage[^h5650], and which did[^h6213] those great[^h1419] signs[^h226] in our sight[^h5869], and preserved[^h8104] us in all the way[^h1870] wherein we went[^h1980], and among all the people[^h5971] through[^h7130] whom we passed[^h5674]:
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] drave out[^h1644] from before[^h6440] us all the people[^h5971], even the Amorites[^h567] which dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776]: therefore will we also serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068]; for he is our God[^h430].
###### 19
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Ye cannot[^h3201] serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068]: for he is an holy[^h6918] God[^h430]; he is a jealous[^h7072] God[^h410]; he will not forgive[^h5375] your transgressions[^h6588] nor your sins[^h2403].
###### 20
If ye forsake[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], and serve[^h5647] strange[^h5236] gods[^h430], then he will turn[^h7725] and do you hurt[^h7489], and consume[^h3615] you, after[^h310] that he hath done you good[^h3190].
###### 21
And the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Nay; but we will serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Ye are witnesses[^h5707] against yourselves that ye have chosen[^h977] you the LORD[^h3068], to serve[^h5647] him. And they said[^h559], We are witnesses[^h5707].
###### 23
Now therefore put away[^h5493], said he, the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430] which are among[^h7130] you, and incline[^h5186] your heart[^h3824] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
And the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], The LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] will we serve[^h5647], and his voice[^h6963] will we obey[^h8085].
###### 25
So Joshua[^h3091] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with the people[^h5971] that day[^h3117], and set[^h7760] them a statute[^h2706] and an ordinance[^h4941] in Shechem[^h7927].
###### 26
And Joshua[^h3091] wrote[^h3789] these words[^h1697] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of God[^h430], and took[^h3947] a great[^h1419] stone[^h68], and set it up[^h6965] there under an oak[^h427], that was by the sanctuary[^h4720] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 27
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], Behold, this stone[^h68] shall be a witness[^h5713] unto us; for it hath heard[^h8085] all the words[^h561] of the LORD[^h3068] which he spake[^h1696] unto us: it shall be therefore a witness[^h5713] unto you, lest ye deny[^h3584] your God[^h430].
###### 28
So Joshua[^h3091] let the people[^h5971] depart[^h7971], every man[^h376] unto his inheritance[^h5159].
###### 29
And it came to pass after[^h310] these things[^h1697], that Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], died[^h4191], being an hundred[^h3967] and ten[^h6235] years[^h8141] old[^h1121].
###### 30
And they buried[^h6912] him in the border[^h1366] of his inheritance[^h5159] in Timnathserah[^h8556], which is in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], on the north side[^h6828] of the hill[^h2022] of Gaash[^h1608].
###### 31
And Israel[^h3478] served[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] all the days[^h3117] of Joshua[^h3091], and all the days[^h3117] of the elders[^h2205] that overlived[^h748] [^h3117] [^h310] Joshua[^h3091], and which had known[^h3045] all the works[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068], that he had done[^h6213] for Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 32
And the bones[^h6106] of Joseph[^h3130], which the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] brought up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], buried[^h6912] they in Shechem[^h7927], in a parcel[^h2513] of ground[^h7704] which Jacob[^h3290] bought[^h7069] of the sons[^h1121] of Hamor[^h2544] the father[^h1] of Shechem[^h7927] for an hundred[^h3967] pieces of silver[^h7192]: and it became the inheritance[^h5159] of the children[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130]. 
###### 33
And Eleazar[^h499] the son[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175] died[^h4191]; and they buried[^h6912] him in a hill[^h1389] that pertained to Phinehas[^h6372] his son[^h1121], which was given[^h5414] him in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669].

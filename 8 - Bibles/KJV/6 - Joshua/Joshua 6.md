###### 1
Now Jericho[^h3405] was straitly[^h5462] shut up[^h5462] because[^h6440] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: none went out[^h3318], and none came in[^h935]. 
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], See[^h7200], I have given[^h5414] into thine hand[^h3027] Jericho[^h3405], and the king[^h4428] thereof, and the mighty men[^h1368] of valour[^h2428].
###### 3
And ye shall compass[^h5437] the city[^h5892], all ye men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and go round about[^h5362] the city[^h5892] once[^h6471] [^h259]. Thus shalt thou do[^h6213] six[^h8337] days[^h3117].
###### 4
And seven[^h7651] priests[^h3548] shall bear[^h5375] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] seven[^h7651] trumpets[^h7782] of rams' horns[^h3104]: and the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] ye shall compass[^h5437] the city[^h5892] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471], and the priests[^h3548] shall blow[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782].
###### 5
And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long[^h4900] blast with the ram's[^h3104] horn[^h7161], and when ye hear[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], all the people[^h5971] shall shout[^h7321] with a great[^h1419] shout[^h8643]; and the wall[^h2346] of the city[^h5892] shall fall down[^h5307] flat[^h8478], and the people[^h5971] shall ascend up[^h5927] every man[^h376] straight before him. 
###### 6
And Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126] called[^h7121] the priests[^h3548], and said[^h559] unto them, Take up[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285], and let seven[^h7651] priests[^h3548] bear[^h5375] seven[^h7651] trumpets[^h7782] of rams' horns[^h3104] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
And he said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Pass on[^h5674], and compass[^h5437] the city[^h5892], and let him that is armed[^h2502] pass on[^h5674] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
And it came to pass, when Joshua[^h3091] had spoken[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], that the seven[^h7651] priests[^h3548] bearing[^h5375] the seven[^h7651] trumpets[^h7782] of rams' horns[^h3104] passed on[^h5674] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and blew[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782]: and the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] followed[^h1980] them[^h310].
###### 9
And the armed[^h2502] men went[^h1980] before[^h6440] the priests[^h3548] that blew[^h8628] [^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782], and the rereward[^h622] came[^h1980] after[^h310] the ark[^h727], the priests going on[^h1980], and blowing[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782]. 
###### 10
And Joshua[^h3091] had commanded[^h6680] the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Ye shall not shout[^h7321], nor make any noise[^h8085] with your voice[^h6963], neither shall any word[^h1697] proceed[^h3318] out of your mouth[^h6310], until the day[^h3117] I bid[^h559] you shout[^h7321]; then shall ye shout[^h7321]. 
###### 11
So the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] compassed[^h5437] the city[^h5892], going about[^h5362] it once[^h6471] [^h259]: and they came[^h935] into the camp[^h4264], and lodged[^h3885] in the camp[^h4264].
###### 12
And Joshua[^h3091] rose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and the priests[^h3548] took up[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And seven[^h7651] priests[^h3548] bearing[^h5375] seven[^h7651] trumpets[^h7782] of rams' horns[^h3104] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] went on[^h1980] continually[^h1980], and blew[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782]: and the armed men[^h2502] went[^h1980] before[^h6440] them; but the rereward[^h622] came[^h1980] after[^h310] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], the priests going on[^h1980], and blowing[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782].
###### 14
And the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] they compassed[^h5437] the city[^h5892] once[^h6471] [^h259], and returned[^h7725] into the camp[^h4264]: so they did[^h6213] six[^h8337] days[^h3117].
###### 15
And it came to pass on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], that they rose early[^h7925] about the dawning[^h5927] of the day[^h7837], and compassed[^h5437] the city[^h5892] after the same manner[^h4941] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471]: only on that day[^h3117] they compassed[^h5437] the city[^h5892] seven[^h7651] times[^h6471].
###### 16
And it came to pass at the seventh[^h7637] time[^h6471], when the priests[^h3548] blew[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782], Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Shout[^h7321]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] you the city[^h5892].
###### 17
And the city[^h5892] shall be accursed[^h2764], even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD[^h3068]: only Rahab[^h7343] the harlot[^h2181] shall live[^h2421], she and all that are with her in the house[^h1004], because she hid[^h2244] the messengers[^h4397] that we sent[^h7971]. 
###### 18
And ye, in any wise[^h7535] keep[^h8104] yourselves from the accursed thing[^h2764], lest ye make yourselves accursed[^h2763], when ye take[^h3947] of the accursed thing[^h2764], and make[^h7760] the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478] a curse[^h2764], and trouble[^h5916] it.  
###### 19
But all the silver[^h3701], and gold[^h2091], and vessels[^h3627] of brass[^h5178] and iron[^h1270], are consecrated[^h6944] unto the LORD[^h3068]: they shall come[^h935] into the treasury[^h214] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 20
So the people[^h5971] shouted[^h7321] when the priests blew[^h8628] with the trumpets[^h7782]: and it came to pass, when the people[^h5971] heard[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], and the people[^h5971] shouted[^h7321] with a great[^h1419] shout[^h8643], that the wall[^h2346] fell down flat[^h5307], so that the people[^h5971] went up[^h5927] into the city[^h5892], every man[^h376] straight before him, and they took[^h3920] the city[^h5892]. 
###### 21
And they utterly destroyed[^h2763] all that was in the city[^h5892], both man[^h376] and woman[^h802], young[^h5288] and old[^h2205], and ox[^h7794], and sheep[^h7716], and ass[^h2543], with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719].
###### 22
But Joshua[^h3091] had said[^h559] unto the two[^h8147] men[^h582] that had spied out[^h7270] the country[^h776], Go[^h935] into the harlot's[^h2181] house[^h1004], and bring out[^h3318] thence the woman[^h802], and all that she hath, as ye sware[^h7650] unto her.
###### 23
And the young men[^h5288] that were spies[^h7270] went in[^h935], and brought out[^h3318] Rahab[^h7343], and her father[^h1], and her mother[^h517], and her brethren[^h251], and all that she had; and they brought out[^h3318] all her kindred[^h4940], and left[^h3240] them without[^h2351] the camp[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 24
And they burnt[^h8313] the city[^h5892] with fire[^h784], and all that was therein: only the silver[^h3701], and the gold[^h2091], and the vessels[^h3627] of brass[^h5178] and of iron[^h1270], they put[^h5414] into the treasury[^h214] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
And Joshua[^h3091] saved[^h2421] Rahab[^h7343] the harlot[^h2181] alive[^h2421], and her father's[^h1] household[^h1004], and all that she had; and she dwelleth[^h3427] in[^h7130] Israel[^h3478] even unto this day[^h3117]; because she hid[^h2244] the messengers[^h4397], which Joshua[^h3091] sent[^h7971] to spy out[^h7270] Jericho[^h3405].
###### 26
And Joshua[^h3091] adjured[^h7650] them at that time[^h6256], saying[^h559], Cursed[^h779] be the man[^h376] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], that riseth up[^h6965] and buildeth[^h1129] this city[^h5892] Jericho[^h3405]: he shall lay the foundation[^h3245] thereof in his firstborn[^h1060], and in his youngest[^h6810] son shall he set up[^h5324] the gates[^h1817] of it.
###### 27
So the LORD[^h3068] was with Joshua[^h3091]; and his fame[^h8089] was noised throughout all the country[^h776].

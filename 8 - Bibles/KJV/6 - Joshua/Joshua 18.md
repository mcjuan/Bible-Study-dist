###### 1
And the whole congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] assembled together[^h6950] at Shiloh[^h7887], and set up[^h7931] the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150] there. And the land[^h776] was subdued[^h3533] before[^h6440] them.
###### 2
And there remained[^h3498] among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] seven[^h7651] tribes[^h7626], which had not yet received[^h2505] their inheritance[^h5159].
###### 3
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], How long are ye slack[^h7503] to go[^h935] to possess[^h3423] the land[^h776], which the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of your fathers[^h1] hath given[^h5414] you?
###### 4
Give out[^h3051] from among you three[^h7969] men[^h582] for each tribe[^h7626]: and I will send[^h7971] them, and they shall rise[^h6965], and go[^h1980] through the land[^h776], and describe[^h3789] it according[^h6310] to the inheritance[^h5159] of them; and they shall come[^h935] again to me.
###### 5
And they shall divide[^h2505] it into seven[^h7651] parts[^h2506]: Judah[^h3063] shall abide[^h5975] in their coast[^h1366] on the south[^h5045], and the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130] shall abide[^h5975] in their coasts[^h1366] on the north[^h6828].
###### 6
Ye shall therefore describe[^h3789] the land[^h776] into seven[^h7651] parts[^h2506], and bring[^h935] the description hither to me, that I may cast[^h3384] lots[^h1486] for you here before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].
###### 7
But the Levites[^h3881] have no part[^h2506] among[^h7130] you; for the priesthood[^h3550] of the LORD[^h3068] is their inheritance[^h5159]: and Gad[^h1410], and Reuben[^h7205], and half[^h2677] the tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], have received[^h3947] their inheritance[^h5159] beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] on the east[^h4217], which Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] them.
###### 8
And the men[^h582] arose[^h6965], and went away[^h3212]: and Joshua[^h3091] charged[^h6680] them that went[^h1980] to describe[^h3789] the land[^h776], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] and walk[^h1980] through the land[^h776], and describe[^h3789] it, and come again[^h7725] to me, that I may here cast[^h7993] lots[^h1486] for you before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] in Shiloh[^h7887].
###### 9
And the men[^h582] went[^h3212] and passed through[^h5674] the land[^h776], and described[^h3789] it by cities[^h5892] into seven[^h7651] parts[^h2506] in a book[^h5612], and came[^h935] again to Joshua[^h3091] to the host[^h4264] at Shiloh[^h7887].
###### 10
And Joshua[^h3091] cast[^h7993] lots[^h1486] for them in Shiloh[^h7887] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and there Joshua[^h3091] divided[^h2505] the land[^h776] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] according to their divisions[^h4256].
###### 11
And the lot[^h1486] of the tribe[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] came up[^h5927] according to their families[^h4940]: and the coast[^h1366] of their lot[^h1486] came forth[^h3318] between the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] and the children[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130].
###### 12
And their border[^h1366] on the north[^h6828] side[^h6285] was from Jordan[^h3383]; and the border[^h1366] went up[^h5927] to the side[^h3802] of Jericho[^h3405] on the north[^h6828] side, and went up[^h5927] through the mountains[^h2022] westward[^h3220]; and the goings out[^h8444] thereof were at the wilderness[^h4057] of Bethaven[^h1007].
###### 13
And the border[^h1366] went over[^h5674] from thence toward Luz[^h3870], to the side[^h3802] of Luz[^h3870], which is Bethel[^h1008], southward[^h5045]; and the border[^h1366] descended[^h3381] to Atarothadar[^h5853], near the hill[^h2022] that lieth on the south side[^h5045] of the nether[^h8481] Bethhoron[^h1032].
###### 14
And the border[^h1366] was drawn[^h8388] thence, and compassed[^h5437] the corner[^h6285] of the sea[^h3220] southward[^h5045], from the hill[^h2022] that lieth before[^h6440] Bethhoron[^h1032] southward[^h5045]; and the goings out[^h8444] thereof were at Kirjathbaal[^h7154], which is Kirjathjearim[^h7157], a city[^h5892] of the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063]: this was the west[^h3220] quarter[^h6285].
###### 15
And the south[^h5045] quarter[^h6285] was from the end[^h7097] of Kirjathjearim[^h7157], and the border[^h1366] went out[^h3318] on the west[^h3220], and went out[^h3318] to the well[^h4599] of waters[^h4325] of Nephtoah[^h5318]:
###### 16
And the border[^h1366] came down[^h3381] to the end[^h7097] of the mountain[^h2022] that lieth before[^h6440] the valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], and which is in the valley[^h6010] of the giants[^h7497] on the north[^h6828], and descended[^h3381] to the valley[^h1516] of Hinnom[^h2011], to the side[^h3802] of Jebusi[^h2983] on the south[^h5045], and descended[^h3381] to Enrogel[^h5883],
###### 17
And was drawn[^h8388] from the north[^h6828], and went forth[^h3318] to Enshemesh[^h5885], and went forth[^h3318] toward Geliloth[^h1553], which is over against[^h5227] the going up[^h4608] of Adummim[^h131], and descended[^h3381] to the stone[^h68] of Bohan[^h932] the son[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205],
###### 18
And passed along[^h5674] toward the side[^h3802] over against[^h4136] Arabah[^h6160] northward[^h6828], and went down[^h3381] unto Arabah[^h6160]: 
###### 19
And the border[^h1366] passed along[^h5674] to the side[^h3802] of Bethhoglah[^h1031] northward[^h6828]: and the outgoings[^h8444] of the border[^h1366] were at the north[^h6828] bay[^h3956] of the salt[^h4417] sea[^h3220] at the south[^h5045] end[^h7097] of Jordan[^h3383]: this was the south[^h5045] coast[^h1366]. 
###### 20
And Jordan[^h3383] was the border[^h1379] of it on the east[^h6924] side[^h6285]. This was the inheritance[^h5159] of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144], by the coasts[^h1367] thereof round about[^h5439], according to their families[^h4940].
###### 21
Now the cities[^h5892] of the tribe[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] according to their families[^h4940] were Jericho[^h3405], and Bethhoglah[^h1031], and the valley[^h6010] of Keziz[^h7104],

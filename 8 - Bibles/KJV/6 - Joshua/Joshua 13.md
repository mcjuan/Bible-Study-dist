###### 1
Now Joshua[^h3091] was old[^h2204] and stricken[^h935] in years[^h3117]; and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Thou art old[^h2204] and stricken[^h935] in years[^h3117], and there remaineth[^h7604] yet very[^h3966] much[^h7235] land[^h776] to be possessed[^h3423]. 
###### 2
This is the land[^h776] that yet remaineth[^h7604]: all the borders[^h1552] of the Philistines[^h6430], and all Geshuri[^h1651],
###### 3
From Sihor[^h7883], which is before[^h6440] Egypt[^h4714], even unto the borders[^h1366] of Ekron[^h6138] northward[^h6828], which is counted[^h2803] to the Canaanite[^h3669]: five[^h2568] lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430]; the Gazathites[^h5841], and the Ashdothites[^h796], the Eshkalonites[^h832], the Gittites[^h1663], and the Ekronites[^h6139]; also the Avites[^h5761]:
###### 4
From the south[^h8486], all the land[^h776] of the Canaanites[^h3669], and Mearah[^h4632] that is beside the Sidonians[^h6722], unto Aphek[^h663], to the borders[^h1366] of the Amorites[^h567]: 
###### 5
And the land[^h776] of the Giblites[^h1382], and all Lebanon[^h3844], toward the sunrising[^h4217] [^h8121], from Baalgad[^h1171] under mount[^h2022] Hermon[^h2768] unto the entering[^h935] into Hamath[^h2574].
###### 6
All the inhabitants[^h3427] of the hill country[^h2022] from Lebanon[^h3844] unto Misrephothmaim[^h4956], and all the Sidonians[^h6722], them will I drive out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: only divide thou it by lot[^h5307] unto the Israelites[^h3478] for an inheritance[^h5159], as I have commanded[^h6680] thee.
###### 7
Now therefore divide[^h2505] this land[^h776] for an inheritance[^h5159] unto the nine[^h8672] tribes[^h7626], and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519],
###### 8
With whom the Reubenites[^h7206] and the Gadites[^h1425] have received[^h3947] their inheritance[^h5159], which Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] them, beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] eastward[^h4217], even as Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] them;
###### 9
From Aroer[^h6177], that is upon the bank[^h8193] of the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769], and the city[^h5892] that is in the midst[^h8432] of the river[^h5158], and all the plain[^h4334] of Medeba[^h4311] unto Dibon[^h1769];
###### 10
And all the cities[^h5892] of Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which reigned[^h4427] in Heshbon[^h2809], unto the border[^h1366] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983];
###### 11
And Gilead[^h1568], and the border[^h1366] of the Geshurites[^h1651] and Maachathites[^h4602], and all mount[^h2022] Hermon[^h2768], and all Bashan[^h1316] unto Salcah[^h5548];
###### 12
All the kingdom[^h4468] of Og[^h5747] in Bashan[^h1316], which reigned[^h4427] in Ashtaroth[^h6252] and in Edrei[^h154], who remained[^h7604] of the remnant[^h3499] of the giants[^h7497]: for these did Moses[^h4872] smite[^h5221], and cast them out[^h3423].
###### 13
Nevertheless the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] expelled[^h3423] not the Geshurites[^h1651], nor the Maachathites[^h4602]: but the Geshurites[^h1650] and the Maachathites[^h4601] dwell[^h3427] among[^h7130] the Israelites[^h3478] until this day[^h3117].
###### 14
Only unto the tribe[^h7626] of Levi[^h3878] he gave[^h5414] none inheritance[^h5159]; the sacrifices[^h801] of the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] made by fire[^h801] are their inheritance[^h5159], as he said[^h1696] unto them.
###### 15
And Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] unto the tribe[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] inheritance according to their families[^h4940].
###### 16
And their coast[^h1366] was from Aroer[^h6177], that is on the bank[^h8193] of the river[^h5158] Arnon[^h769], and the city[^h5892] that is in the midst[^h8432] of the river[^h5158], and all the plain[^h4334] by Medeba[^h4311];
###### 17
Heshbon[^h2809], and all her cities[^h5892] that are in the plain[^h4334]; Dibon[^h1769], and Bamothbaal[^h1120], and Bethbaalmeon[^h1010], 
###### 18
And Jahazah[^h3096], and Kedemoth[^h6932], and Mephaath[^h4158],
###### 19
And Kirjathaim[^h7156], and Sibmah[^h7643], and Zarethshahar[^h6890] in the mount[^h2022] of the valley[^h6010],
###### 20
And Bethpeor[^h1047], and Ashdothpisgah[^h798] [^h794], and Bethjeshimoth[^h1020], 
###### 21
And all the cities[^h5892] of the plain[^h4334], and all the kingdom[^h4468] of Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], which reigned[^h4427] in Heshbon[^h2809], whom Moses[^h4872] smote[^h5221] with the princes[^h5387] of Midian[^h4080], Evi[^h189], and Rekem[^h7552], and Zur[^h6698], and Hur[^h2354], and Reba[^h7254], which were dukes[^h5257] of Sihon[^h5511], dwelling[^h3427] in the country[^h776].
###### 22
Balaam[^h1109] also the son[^h1121] of Beor[^h1160], the soothsayer[^h7080], did the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] slay[^h2026] with the sword[^h2719] among them[^h413] that were slain[^h2491] by them. 
###### 23
And the border[^h1366] of the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] was Jordan[^h3383], and the border[^h1366] thereof. This was the inheritance[^h5159] of the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] after their families[^h4940], the cities[^h5892] and the villages[^h2691] thereof.
###### 24
And Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] inheritance unto the tribe[^h4294] of Gad[^h1410], even unto the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] according to their families[^h4940].
###### 25
And their coast[^h1366] was Jazer[^h3270], and all the cities[^h5892] of Gilead[^h1568], and half[^h2677] the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], unto Aroer[^h6177] that is before[^h6440] Rabbah[^h7237];
###### 26
And from Heshbon[^h2809] unto Ramathmizpeh[^h7434], and Betonim[^h993]; and from Mahanaim[^h4266] unto the border[^h1366] of Debir[^h1688];
###### 27
And in the valley[^h6010], Betharam[^h1027], and Bethnimrah[^h1039], and Succoth[^h5523], and Zaphon[^h6829], the rest[^h3499] of the kingdom[^h4468] of Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], Jordan[^h3383] and his border[^h1366], even unto the edge[^h7097] of the sea[^h3220] of Chinnereth[^h3672] on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] eastward[^h4217].
###### 28
This is the inheritance[^h5159] of the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] after their families[^h4940], the cities[^h5892], and their villages[^h2691].
###### 29
And Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] inheritance unto the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519]: and this was the possession of the half[^h2677] tribe[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] by their families[^h4940].
###### 30
And their coast[^h1366] was from Mahanaim[^h4266], all Bashan[^h1316], all the kingdom[^h4468] of Og[^h5747] king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], and all the towns[^h2333] of Jair[^h2971], which are in Bashan[^h1316], threescore[^h8346] cities[^h5892]:

And half[^h2677] Gilead[^h1568], and Ashtaroth[^h6252], and Edrei[^h154], cities[^h5892] of the kingdom[^h4468] of Og[^h5747] in Bashan[^h1316], were pertaining unto the children[^h1121] of Machir[^h4353] the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519], even to the one half[^h2677] of the children[^h1121] of Machir[^h4353] by their families[^h4940].
###### 32
These are the countries which Moses[^h4872] did distribute for inheritance[^h5157] in the plains[^h6160] of Moab[^h4124], on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], by Jericho[^h3405], eastward[^h4217].
###### 33
But unto the tribe[^h7626] of Levi[^h3878] Moses[^h4872] gave[^h5414] not any inheritance[^h5159]: the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] was their inheritance[^h5159], as he said[^h1696] unto them.

###### 1
And Joshua[^h3091] rose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242]; and they removed[^h5265] from Shittim[^h7851], and came[^h935] to Jordan[^h3383], he and all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and lodged[^h3885] there before they passed over[^h5674].
###### 2
And it came to pass after[^h7097] three[^h7969] days[^h3117], that the officers[^h7860] went[^h5674] through[^h7130] the host[^h4264];
###### 3
And they commanded[^h6680] the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], When ye see[^h7200] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881] bearing[^h5375] it, then ye shall remove[^h5265] from your place[^h4725], and go[^h1980] after[^h310] it.
###### 4
Yet there shall be a space[^h7350] between you and it, about two thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520] by measure[^h4060]: come not near[^h7126] unto it, that ye may know[^h3045] the way[^h1870] by which ye must go[^h3212]: for ye have not passed[^h5674] this way[^h1870] heretofore[^h8543] [^h8032]. 
###### 5
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Sanctify[^h6942] yourselves: for to morrow[^h4279] the LORD[^h3068] will do[^h6213] wonders[^h6381] among[^h7130] you.
###### 6
And Joshua[^h3091] spake[^h559] unto the priests[^h3548], saying[^h559], Take up[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285], and pass over[^h5674] before[^h6440] the people[^h5971]. And they took up[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285], and went[^h3212] before[^h6440] the people[^h5971].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], This day[^h3117] will I begin[^h2490] to magnify[^h1431] thee in the sight[^h5869] of all Israel[^h3478], that they may know[^h3045] that, as I was with Moses[^h4872], so I will be with thee.
###### 8
And thou shalt command[^h6680] the priests[^h3548] that bear[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285], saying[^h559], When ye are come[^h935] to the brink[^h7097] of the water[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383], ye shall stand still[^h5975] in Jordan[^h3383].
###### 9
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Come hither[^h5066], and hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 10
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559], Hereby ye shall know[^h3045] that the living[^h2416] God[^h410] is among[^h7130] you, and that he will without fail[^h3423] drive out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] you the Canaanites[^h3669], and the Hittites[^h2850], and the Hivites[^h2340], and the Perizzites[^h6522], and the Girgashites[^h1622], and the Amorites[^h567], and the Jebusites[^h2983].
###### 11
Behold, the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the Lord[^h113] of all the earth[^h776] passeth over[^h5674] before[^h6440] you into Jordan[^h3383].
###### 12
Now therefore take[^h3947] you twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] men[^h376] out of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], out of every[^h259] tribe[^h7626] a man[^h376].
###### 13
And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles[^h3709] of the feet[^h7272] of the priests[^h3548] that bear[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], the Lord[^h113] of all the earth[^h776], shall rest[^h5117] in the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383], that the waters[^h4325] of Jordan[^h3383] shall be cut off[^h3772] from the waters[^h4325] that come down[^h3381] from above[^h4605]; and they shall stand[^h5975] upon an[^h259] heap[^h5067].
###### 14
And it came to pass, when the people[^h5971] removed[^h5265] from their tents[^h168], to pass over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], and the priests[^h3548] bearing[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] before[^h6440] the people[^h5971];
###### 15
And as they that bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] were come[^h935] unto Jordan[^h3383], and the feet[^h7272] of the priests[^h3548] that bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] were dipped[^h2881] in the brim[^h7097] of the water[^h4325], (for Jordan[^h3383] overfloweth[^h4390] all his banks[^h1415] all the time[^h3117] of harvest[^h7105],)
###### 16
That the waters[^h4325] which came down[^h3381] from above[^h4605] stood[^h5975] and rose up[^h6965] upon an[^h259] heap[^h5067] very[^h3966] far[^h7368] from the city[^h5892] Adam[^h121], that is beside[^h6654] Zaretan[^h6891]: and those that came down[^h3381] toward the sea[^h3220] of the plain[^h6160], even the salt[^h4417] sea[^h3220], failed[^h8552], and were cut off[^h3772]: and the people[^h5971] passed over[^h5674] right against Jericho[^h3405].
###### 17
And the priests[^h3548] that bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h5975] firm[^h3559] on dry ground[^h2724] in the midst[^h8432] of Jordan[^h3383], and all the Israelites[^h3478] passed over[^h5674] on dry ground[^h2724], until all the people[^h1471] were passed[^h5674] clean[^h8552] over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383].

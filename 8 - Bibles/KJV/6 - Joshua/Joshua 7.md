###### 1
But the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] committed[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604] in the accursed thing[^h2764]: for Achan[^h5912], the son[^h1121] of Carmi[^h3756], the son[^h1121] of Zabdi[^h2067], the son[^h1121] of Zerah[^h2226], of the tribe[^h4294] of Judah[^h3063], took[^h3947] of the accursed thing[^h2764]: and the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was kindled[^h2734] against the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And Joshua[^h3091] sent[^h7971] men[^h582] from Jericho[^h3405] to Ai[^h5857], which is beside[^h5973] Bethaven[^h1007], on the east side[^h6924] of Bethel[^h1008], and spake[^h559] unto them, saying[^h559], Go up[^h5927] and view[^h7270] the country[^h776]. And the men[^h582] went up[^h5927] and viewed[^h7270] Ai[^h5857].
###### 3
And they returned[^h7725] to Joshua[^h3091], and said[^h559] unto him, Let not all the people[^h5971] go up[^h5927]; but let about two or three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] go up[^h5927] and smite[^h5221] Ai[^h5857]; and make not all the people[^h5971] to labour[^h3021] thither; for they are but few[^h4592]. 
###### 4
So there went up[^h5927] thither of the people[^h5971] about three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]: and they fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] the men[^h582] of Ai[^h5857].
###### 5
And the men[^h582] of Ai[^h5857] smote[^h5221] of them about thirty[^h7970] and six[^h8337] men[^h376]: for they chased[^h7291] them from before[^h6440] the gate[^h8179] even unto Shebarim[^h7671], and smote[^h5221] them in the going down[^h4174]: wherefore the hearts[^h3824] of the people[^h5971] melted[^h4549], and became as water[^h4325]. 
###### 6
And Joshua[^h3091] rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h8071], and fell[^h5307] to the earth[^h776] upon his face[^h6440] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] until the eventide[^h6153], he and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and put[^h5927] dust[^h6083] upon their heads[^h7218].
###### 7
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559], Alas, O[^h162] Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], wherefore hast thou at all[^h5674] brought[^h5674] this people[^h5971] over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383], to deliver[^h5414] us into the hand[^h3027] of the Amorites[^h567], to destroy[^h6] us? would to God[^h3863] we had been content[^h2974], and dwelt[^h3427] on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]!
###### 8
O[^h994] Lord[^h136], what shall I say[^h559], when[^h310] Israel[^h3478] turneth[^h2015] their backs[^h6203] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341]! 
###### 9
For the Canaanites[^h3669] and all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] shall hear[^h8085] of it, and shall environ us round[^h5437], and cut off[^h3772] our name[^h8034] from the earth[^h776]: and what wilt thou do[^h6213] unto thy great[^h1419] name[^h8034]?
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Get thee up[^h6965]; wherefore liest[^h5307] thou thus upon thy face[^h6440]? 
###### 11
Israel[^h3478] hath sinned[^h2398], and they have also transgressed[^h5674] my covenant[^h1285] which I commanded[^h6680] them: for they have even taken[^h3947] of the accursed thing[^h2764], and have also stolen[^h1589], and dissembled[^h3584] also, and they have put[^h7760] it even among their own stuff[^h3627].
###### 12
Therefore the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] could[^h3201] not stand[^h6965] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341], but turned[^h6437] their backs[^h6203] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341], because they were accursed[^h2764]: neither will I be with you any more[^h3254], except[^h3808] ye destroy[^h8045] the accursed[^h2764] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 13
Up[^h6965], sanctify[^h6942] the people[^h5971], and say[^h559], Sanctify[^h6942] yourselves against to morrow[^h4279]: for thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], There is an accursed thing[^h2764] in the midst[^h7130] of thee, O Israel[^h3478]: thou canst[^h3201] not stand[^h6965] before[^h6440] thine enemies[^h341], until ye take away[^h5493] the accursed thing[^h2764] from among[^h7130] you.
###### 14
In the morning[^h1242] therefore ye shall be brought[^h7126] according to your tribes[^h7626]: and it shall be, that the tribe[^h7626] which the LORD[^h3068] taketh[^h3920] shall come[^h7126] according to the families[^h4940] thereof; and the family[^h4940] which the LORD[^h3068] shall take[^h3920] shall come[^h7126] by households[^h1004]; and the household[^h1004] which the LORD[^h3068] shall take[^h3920] shall come[^h7126] man[^h1397] by man[^h1397].
###### 15
And it shall be, that he that is taken[^h3920] with the accursed thing[^h2764] shall be burnt[^h8313] with fire[^h784], he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed[^h5674] the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], and because he hath wrought[^h6213] folly[^h5039] in Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 16
So Joshua[^h3091] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and brought[^h7126] Israel[^h3478] by their tribes[^h7626]; and the tribe[^h7626] of Judah[^h3063] was taken[^h3920]:
###### 17
And he brought[^h7126] the family[^h4940] of Judah[^h3063]; and he took[^h3920] the family[^h4940] of the Zarhites[^h2227]: and he brought[^h7126] the family[^h4940] of the Zarhites[^h2227] man[^h1397] by man[^h1397]; and Zabdi[^h2067] was taken[^h3920]:
###### 18
And he brought[^h7126] his household[^h1004] man[^h1397] by man[^h1397]; and Achan[^h5912], the son[^h1121] of Carmi[^h3756], the son[^h1121] of Zabdi[^h2067], the son[^h1121] of Zerah[^h2226], of the tribe[^h4294] of Judah[^h3063], was taken[^h3920].
###### 19
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto Achan[^h5912], My son[^h1121], give[^h7760], I pray thee, glory[^h3519] to the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], and make[^h5414] confession[^h8426] unto him; and tell[^h5046] me now what thou hast done[^h6213]; hide[^h3582] it not from me.
###### 20
And Achan[^h5912] answered[^h6030] Joshua[^h3091], and said[^h559], Indeed[^h546] I have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], and thus and thus have I done[^h6213]:
###### 21
When I saw[^h7200] among the spoils[^h7998] a[^h259] goodly[^h2896] Babylonish[^h8152] garment[^h155], and two hundred[^h3967] shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701], and a[^h259] wedge[^h3956] of gold[^h2091] of fifty[^h2572] shekels[^h8255] weight[^h4948], then I coveted[^h2530] them, and took[^h3947] them; and, behold, they are hid[^h2934] in the earth[^h776] in the midst[^h8432] of my tent[^h168], and the silver[^h3701] under it. 
###### 22
So Joshua[^h3091] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397], and they ran[^h7323] unto the tent[^h168]; and, behold, it was hid[^h2934] in his tent[^h168], and the silver[^h3701] under it.
###### 23
And they took[^h3947] them out of the midst[^h8432] of the tent[^h168], and brought[^h935] them unto Joshua[^h3091], and unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and laid them out[^h3332] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 24
And Joshua[^h3091], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, took[^h3947] Achan[^h5912] the son[^h1121] of Zerah[^h2226], and the silver[^h3701], and the garment[^h155], and the wedge[^h3956] of gold[^h2091], and his sons[^h1121], and his daughters[^h1323], and his oxen[^h7794], and his asses[^h2543], and his sheep[^h6629], and his tent[^h168], and all that he had: and they brought[^h5927] them unto the valley[^h6010] of Achor[^h5911].
###### 25
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559], Why[^h4100] hast thou troubled[^h5916] us? the LORD[^h3068] shall trouble[^h5916] thee this day[^h3117]. And all Israel[^h3478] stoned[^h7275] him with stones[^h68], and burned[^h8313] them with fire[^h784], after they had stoned[^h5619] them with stones[^h68].
###### 26
And they raised[^h6965] over him a great[^h1419] heap[^h1530] of stones[^h68] unto this day[^h3117]. So the LORD[^h3068] turned[^h7725] from the fierceness[^h2740] of his anger[^h639]. Wherefore the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] was called[^h7121], The valley[^h6010] of Achor[^h5911], unto this day[^h3117].

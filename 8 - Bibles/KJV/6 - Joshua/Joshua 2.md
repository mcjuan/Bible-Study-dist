###### 1
And Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126] sent[^h7971] out of Shittim[^h7851] two[^h8147] men[^h582] to spy[^h7270] secretly[^h2791], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] view[^h7200] the land[^h776], even Jericho[^h3405]. And they went[^h3212], and came[^h935] into an harlot's[^h2181] house[^h802] [^h1004], named[^h8034] Rahab[^h7343], and lodged[^h7901] there.  
###### 2
And it was told[^h559] the king[^h4428] of Jericho[^h3405], saying[^h559], Behold, there came[^h935] men[^h582] in hither to night[^h3915] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] to search out[^h2658] the country[^h776].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] of Jericho[^h3405] sent[^h7971] unto Rahab[^h7343], saying[^h559], Bring forth[^h3318] the men[^h582] that are come[^h935] to thee, which are entered[^h935] into thine house[^h1004]: for they be come[^h935] to search out[^h2658] all the country[^h776].
###### 4
And the woman[^h802] took[^h3947] the two[^h8147] men[^h582], and hid[^h6845] them, and said[^h559] thus, There came[^h935] men[^h582] unto me, but I wist[^h3045] not whence[^h370] they were:
###### 5
And it came to pass about the time of shutting[^h5462] of the gate[^h8179], when it was dark[^h2822], that the men[^h582] went out[^h3318]: whither the men[^h582] went[^h1980] I wot[^h3045] not: pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] them quickly[^h4118]; for ye shall overtake[^h5381] them.
###### 6
But she had brought them up[^h5927] to the roof[^h1406] of the house, and hid[^h2934] them with the stalks[^h6086] of flax[^h6593], which she had laid in order[^h6186] upon the roof[^h1406].
###### 7
And the men[^h582] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] them the way[^h1870] to Jordan[^h3383] unto the fords[^h4569]: and as soon as they which pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] them were gone out[^h3318], they shut[^h5462] the gate[^h8179].
###### 8
And before they were laid down[^h7901], she came up[^h5927] unto them upon the roof[^h1406];
###### 9
And she said[^h559] unto the men[^h582], I know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] you the land[^h776], and that your terror[^h367] is fallen[^h5307] upon us, and that all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] faint[^h4127] because[^h6440] of you. 
###### 10
For we have heard[^h8085] how the LORD[^h3068] dried up[^h3001] the water[^h4325] of the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220] for you[^h6440], when ye came out[^h3318] of Egypt[^h4714]; and what ye did[^h6213] unto the two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], that were on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], Sihon[^h5511] and Og[^h5747], whom ye utterly destroyed[^h2763].
###### 11
And as soon as we had heard[^h8085] these things, our hearts[^h3824] did melt[^h4549], neither did there remain[^h6965] any more courage[^h7307] in any man[^h376], because[^h6440] of you: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], he is God[^h430] in heaven[^h8064] above[^h4605], and in earth[^h776] beneath. 
###### 12
Now therefore, I pray you, swear[^h7650] unto me by the LORD[^h3068], since[^h3588] I have shewed[^h6213] you kindness[^h2617], that ye will also shew[^h6213] kindness[^h2617] unto my father's[^h1] house[^h1004], and give[^h5414] me a true[^h571] token[^h226]:
###### 13
And that ye will save alive[^h2421] my father[^h1], and my mother[^h517], and my brethren[^h251], and my sisters[^h269], and all that they have, and deliver[^h5337] our lives[^h5315] from death[^h4194].
###### 14
And the men[^h582] answered[^h559] her, Our life[^h5315] for yours[^h4191], if ye utter[^h5046] not this our business[^h1697]. And it shall be, when the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] us the land[^h776], that we will deal[^h6213] kindly[^h2617] and truly[^h571] with thee. 
###### 15
Then she let them down[^h3381] by a cord[^h2256] through[^h1157] the window[^h2474]: for her house[^h1004] was upon the town[^h7023] wall[^h2346], and she dwelt[^h3427] upon the wall[^h2346].
###### 16
And she said[^h559] unto them, Get[^h3212] you to the mountain[^h2022], lest the pursuers[^h7291] meet[^h6293] you; and hide[^h2247] yourselves there three[^h7969] days[^h3117], until the pursuers[^h7291] be returned[^h7725]: and afterward[^h310] may ye go[^h3212] your way[^h1870].
###### 17
And the men[^h582] said[^h559] unto her, We will be blameless[^h5355] of this thine oath[^h7621] which thou hast made us swear[^h7650].
###### 18
Behold, when we come[^h935] into the land[^h776], thou shalt bind[^h7194] this line[^h8615] of scarlet[^h8144] thread[^h2339] in the window[^h2474] which thou didst let us down by[^h3381]: and thou shalt bring[^h622] thy father[^h1], and thy mother[^h517], and thy brethren[^h251], and all thy father's[^h1] household[^h1004], home[^h1004] unto thee. 
###### 19
And it shall be, that whosoever[^h834] shall go out[^h3318] of the doors[^h1817] of thy house[^h1004] into the street[^h2351], his blood[^h1818] shall be upon his head[^h7218], and we will be guiltless[^h5355]: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house[^h1004], his blood[^h1818] shall be on our head[^h7218], if any hand[^h3027] be upon him.
###### 20
And if thou utter[^h5046] this our business[^h1697], then we will be quit[^h5355] of thine oath[^h7621] which thou hast made us to swear[^h7650].
###### 21
And she said[^h559], According unto your words[^h1697], so be it. And she sent them away[^h7971], and they departed[^h3212]: and she bound[^h7194] the scarlet[^h8144] line[^h8615] in the window[^h2474].
###### 22
And they went[^h3212], and came[^h935] unto the mountain[^h2022], and abode[^h3427] there three[^h7969] days[^h3117], until the pursuers[^h7291] were returned[^h7725]: and the pursuers[^h7291] sought[^h1245] them throughout all the way[^h1870], but found[^h4672] them not.
###### 23
So the two[^h8147] men[^h582] returned[^h7725], and descended[^h3381] from the mountain[^h2022], and passed over[^h5674], and came[^h935] to Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], and told[^h5608] him all things that befell[^h4672] them:
###### 24
And they said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Truly[^h3588] the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] into our hands[^h3027] all the land[^h776]; for even all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the country[^h776] do faint[^h4127] because[^h6440] of us.

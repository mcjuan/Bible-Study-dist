###### 1
Then Joshua[^h3091] called[^h7121] the Reubenites[^h7206], and the Gadites[^h1425], and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h4294] of Manasseh[^h4519],
###### 2
And said[^h559] unto them, Ye have kept[^h8104] all that Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] you, and have obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963] in all that I commanded[^h6680] you:
###### 3
Ye have not left[^h5800] your brethren[^h251] these many[^h7227] days[^h3117] unto this day[^h3117], but have kept[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of the commandment[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 4
And now the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath given rest[^h5117] unto your brethren[^h251], as he promised[^h1696] them: therefore now return[^h6437] ye, and get[^h3212] you unto your tents[^h168], and unto the land[^h776] of your possession[^h272], which Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] gave[^h5414] you on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383].
###### 5
But take diligent[^h3966] heed[^h8104] to do[^h6213] the commandment[^h4687] and the law[^h8451], which Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] charged[^h6680] you, to love[^h157] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430], and to walk[^h3212] in all his ways[^h1870], and to keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687], and to cleave[^h1692] unto him, and to serve[^h5647] him with all your heart[^h3824] and with all your soul[^h5315].
###### 6
So Joshua[^h3091] blessed[^h1288] them, and sent them away[^h7971]: and they went[^h3212] unto their tents[^h168].
###### 7
Now to the one half[^h2677] of the tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] Moses[^h4872] had given[^h5414] possession in Bashan[^h1316]: but unto the other half[^h2677] thereof gave[^h5414] Joshua[^h3091] among[^h5973] their brethren[^h251] on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] westward[^h3220]. And when Joshua[^h3091] sent them away[^h7971] also unto their tents[^h168], then he blessed[^h1288] them,
###### 8
And he spake[^h559] unto them, saying[^h559], Return[^h7725] with much[^h7227] riches[^h5233] unto your tents[^h168], and with very[^h3966] much[^h7227] cattle[^h4735], with silver[^h3701], and with gold[^h2091], and with brass[^h5178], and with iron[^h1270], and with very[^h3966] much[^h7235] raiment[^h8008]: divide[^h2505] the spoil[^h7998] of your enemies[^h341] with your brethren[^h251].
###### 9
And the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] returned[^h7725], and departed[^h3212] from the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of Shiloh[^h7887], which is in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], to go[^h3212] unto the country[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], to the land[^h776] of their possession[^h272], whereof they were possessed[^h270], according to the word[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 10
And when they came[^h935] unto the borders[^h1552] of Jordan[^h3383], that are in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] built[^h1129] there an altar[^h4196] by Jordan[^h3383], a great[^h1419] altar[^h4196] to see to[^h4758].
###### 11
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] say[^h559], Behold, the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] have built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] over against[^h4136] the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], in the borders[^h1552] of Jordan[^h3383], at the passage[^h5676] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 12
And when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] of it, the whole congregation[^h5712] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] gathered themselves together[^h6950] at Shiloh[^h7887], to go up[^h5927] to war[^h6635] against them.
###### 13
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] unto the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and to the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], and to the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], into the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], Phinehas[^h6372] the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548],
###### 14
And with him ten[^h6235] princes[^h5387], of each[^h259] [^h259] chief[^h5387] [^h5387] house[^h1004] a prince[^h1] throughout all the tribes[^h4294] of Israel[^h3478]; and each one[^h376] was an head[^h7218] of the house[^h1004] of their fathers[^h1] among the thousands[^h505] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 15
And they came[^h935] unto the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and to the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], and to the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519], unto the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], and they spake[^h1696] with them, saying[^h559],
###### 16
Thus saith[^h559] the whole congregation[^h5712] of the LORD[^h3068], What trespass[^h4604] is this that ye have committed[^h4603] against the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], to turn away[^h7725] this day[^h3117] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], in that ye have builded[^h1129] you an altar[^h4196], that ye might rebel[^h4775] this day[^h3117] against the LORD[^h3068]?
###### 17
Is the iniquity[^h5771] of Peor[^h6465] too little[^h4592] for us, from which we are not cleansed[^h2891] until this day[^h3117], although there was a plague[^h5063] in the congregation[^h5712] of the LORD[^h3068],
###### 18
But that ye must turn away[^h7725] this day[^h3117] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068]? and it will be, seeing ye rebel[^h4775] to day[^h3117] against the LORD[^h3068], that to morrow[^h4279] he will be wroth[^h7107] with the whole congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 19
Notwithstanding[^h389], if the land[^h776] of your possession[^h272] be unclean[^h2931], then pass ye over[^h5674] unto the land[^h776] of the possession[^h272] of the LORD[^h3068], wherein the LORD'S[^h3068] tabernacle[^h4908] dwelleth[^h7931], and take possession[^h270] among[^h8432] us: but rebel[^h4775] not against the LORD[^h3068], nor[^h408] rebel[^h4775] against us, in building[^h1129] you an altar[^h4196] beside[^h1107] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].
###### 20
Did not Achan[^h5912] the son[^h1121] of Zerah[^h2226] commit[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604] in the accursed thing[^h2764], and wrath[^h7110] fell[^h1961] on all the congregation[^h5712] of Israel[^h3478]? and that man[^h376] perished[^h1478] not alone[^h259] in his iniquity[^h5771].
###### 21
Then the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] and the half[^h2677] tribe[^h7626] of Manasseh[^h4519] answered[^h6030], and said[^h1696] unto the heads[^h7218] of the thousands[^h505] of Israel[^h3478],
###### 22
The LORD[^h3068] God[^h410] of gods[^h430], the LORD[^h3068] God[^h410] of gods[^h430], he knoweth[^h3045], and Israel[^h3478] he shall know[^h3045]; if it be in rebellion[^h4777], or if in transgression[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068], (save[^h3467] us not this day[^h3117],)
###### 23
That we have built[^h1129] us an altar[^h4196] to turn[^h7725] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], or if to offer[^h5927] thereon burnt offering[^h5930] or meat offering[^h4503], or if to offer[^h6213] peace[^h8002] offerings[^h2077] thereon, let the LORD[^h3068] himself require[^h1245] it;
###### 24
And if we have not rather done[^h6213] it for fear[^h1674] of this thing[^h1697], saying[^h559], In time to come[^h4279] your children[^h1121] might speak[^h559] unto our children[^h1121], saying[^h559], What have ye to do with the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]? 
###### 25
For the LORD[^h3068] hath made[^h5414] Jordan[^h3383] a border[^h1366] between us and you, ye children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410]; ye have no part[^h2506] in the LORD[^h3068]: so shall your children[^h1121] make[^h7673] our children[^h1121] cease[^h7673] from[^h1115] fearing[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 26
Therefore we said[^h559], Let us now prepare[^h6213] to build[^h1129] us an altar[^h4196], not for burnt offering[^h5930], nor for sacrifice[^h2077]:
###### 27
But that it may be a witness[^h5707] between us, and you, and our generations[^h1755] after[^h310] us, that we might do[^h5647] the service[^h5656] of the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] him with our burnt offerings[^h5930], and with our sacrifices[^h2077], and with our peace offerings[^h8002]; that your children[^h1121] may not say[^h559] to our children[^h1121] in time to come[^h4279], Ye have no part[^h2506] in the LORD[^h3068].
###### 28
Therefore said[^h559] we, that it shall be, when they should so say[^h559] to us or to our generations[^h1755] in time to come[^h4279], that we may say[^h559] again, Behold[^h7200] the pattern[^h8403] of the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], which our fathers[^h1] made[^h6213], not for burnt offerings[^h5930], nor for sacrifices[^h2077]; but it is a witness[^h5707] between us and you.
###### 29
God forbid[^h2486] that we should rebel[^h4775] against the LORD[^h3068], and turn[^h7725] this day[^h3117] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], to build[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] for burnt offerings[^h5930], for meat offerings[^h4503], or for sacrifices[^h2077], beside the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] that is before[^h6440] his tabernacle[^h4908].
###### 30
And when Phinehas[^h6372] the priest[^h3548], and the princes[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712] and heads[^h7218] of the thousands[^h505] of Israel[^h3478] which were with him, heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] that the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] and the children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519] spake[^h1696], it pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] them. 
###### 31
And Phinehas[^h6372] the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548] said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and to the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], and to the children[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519], This day[^h3117] we perceive[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] is among[^h8432] us, because ye have not committed[^h4603] this trespass[^h4604] against the LORD[^h3068]: now[^h227] ye have delivered[^h5337] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 32
And Phinehas[^h6372] the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and the princes[^h5387], returned[^h7725] from the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205], and from the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410], out of the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], unto the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and brought[^h7725] them word[^h1697] again[^h7725].
###### 33
And the thing[^h1697] pleased[^h3190] [^h5869] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] blessed[^h1288] God[^h430], and did not intend[^h559] to go up[^h5927] against them in battle[^h6635], to destroy[^h7843] the land[^h776] wherein the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and Gad[^h1410] dwelt[^h3427].
###### 34
And the children[^h1121] of Reuben[^h7205] and the children[^h1121] of Gad[^h1410] called[^h7121] the altar[^h4196] Ed: for it shall be a witness[^h5707] between us that the LORD[^h3068] is God[^h430].

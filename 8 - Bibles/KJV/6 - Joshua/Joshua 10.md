###### 1
Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek[^h139] king[^h4428] of Jerusalem[^h3389] had heard[^h8085] how[^h3588] Joshua[^h3091] had taken[^h3920] Ai[^h5857], and had utterly destroyed[^h2763] it; as he had done[^h6213] to Jericho[^h3405] and her king[^h4428], so he had done[^h6213] to Ai[^h5857] and her king[^h4428]; and how the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gibeon[^h1391] had made peace[^h7999] with Israel[^h3478], and were among[^h7130] them;
###### 2
That they feared[^h3372] greatly[^h3966], because Gibeon[^h1391] was a great[^h1419] city[^h5892], as one[^h259] of the royal[^h4467] cities[^h5892], and because it was greater[^h1419] than Ai[^h5857], and all the men[^h582] thereof were mighty[^h1368]. 
###### 3
Wherefore Adonizedek[^h139] king[^h4428] of Jerusalem[^h3389] sent[^h7971] unto Hoham[^h1944] king[^h4428] of Hebron[^h2275], and unto Piram[^h6502] king[^h4428] of Jarmuth[^h3412], and unto Japhia[^h3309] king[^h4428] of Lachish[^h3923], and unto Debir[^h1688] king[^h4428] of Eglon[^h5700], saying[^h559],
###### 4
Come up[^h5927] unto me, and help[^h5826] me, that we may smite[^h5221] Gibeon[^h1391]: for it hath made peace[^h7999] with Joshua[^h3091] and with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
Therefore the five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], the king[^h4428] of Jerusalem[^h3389], the king[^h4428] of Hebron[^h2275], the king[^h4428] of Jarmuth[^h3412], the king[^h4428] of Lachish[^h3923], the king[^h4428] of Eglon[^h5700], gathered themselves together[^h622], and went up[^h5927], they and all their hosts[^h4264], and encamped[^h2583] before Gibeon[^h1391], and made war[^h3898] against it.
###### 6
And the men[^h582] of Gibeon[^h1391] sent[^h7971] unto Joshua[^h3091] to the camp[^h4264] to Gilgal[^h1537], saying[^h559], Slack[^h7503] not thy hand[^h3027] from thy servants[^h5650]; come up[^h5927] to us quickly[^h4120], and save[^h3467] us, and help[^h5826] us: for all the kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567] that dwell[^h3427] in the mountains[^h2022] are gathered together[^h6908] against us.
###### 7
So Joshua[^h3091] ascended[^h5927] from Gilgal[^h1537], he, and all the people[^h5971] of war[^h4421] with him, and all the mighty[^h1368] men of valour[^h2428].
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Fear[^h3372] them not: for I have delivered[^h5414] them into thine hand[^h3027]; there shall not a man[^h376] of them stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] thee.
###### 9
Joshua[^h3091] therefore came[^h935] unto them suddenly[^h6597], and went up[^h5927] from Gilgal[^h1537] all night[^h3915].
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] discomfited[^h2000] them before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], and slew[^h5221] them with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347] at Gibeon[^h1391], and chased[^h7291] them along the way[^h1870] that goeth up[^h4608] to Bethhoron[^h1032], and smote[^h5221] them to Azekah[^h5825], and unto Makkedah[^h4719].
###### 11
And it came to pass, as they fled[^h5127] from before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478], and were in the going down[^h4174] to Bethhoron[^h1032], that the LORD[^h3068] cast down[^h7993] great[^h1419] stones[^h68] from heaven[^h8064] upon them unto Azekah[^h5825], and they died[^h4191]: they were more[^h7227] which died[^h4191] with hailstones[^h1259] [^h68] than they whom[^h834] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] slew[^h2026] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 12
Then spake[^h1696] Joshua[^h3091] to the LORD[^h3068] in the day[^h3117] when the LORD[^h3068] delivered up[^h5414] the Amorites[^h567] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and he said[^h559] in the sight[^h5869] of Israel[^h3478], Sun[^h8121], stand thou still[^h1826] upon Gibeon[^h1391]; and thou, Moon[^h3394], in the valley[^h6010] of Ajalon[^h357]. 
###### 13
And the sun[^h8121] stood still[^h1826], and the moon[^h3394] stayed[^h5975], until the people[^h1471] had avenged[^h5358] themselves upon their enemies[^h341]. Is not this[^h1931] written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of Jasher[^h3477]? So the sun[^h8121] stood still[^h5975] in the midst[^h2677] of heaven[^h8064], and hasted[^h213] not to go down[^h935] about a whole[^h8549] day[^h3117]. 
###### 14
And there was no day[^h3117] like that before[^h6440] it or after[^h310] it, that the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of a man[^h376]: for the LORD[^h3068] fought[^h3898] for Israel[^h3478].
###### 15
And Joshua[^h3091] returned[^h7725], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, unto the camp[^h4264] to Gilgal[^h1537].
###### 16
But these five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] fled[^h5127], and hid[^h2244] themselves in a cave[^h4631] at Makkedah[^h4719].
###### 17
And it was told[^h5046] Joshua[^h3091], saying[^h559], The five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] are found[^h4672] hid[^h2244] in a cave[^h4631] at Makkedah[^h4719].
###### 18
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559], Roll[^h1556] great[^h1419] stones[^h68] upon the mouth[^h6310] of the cave[^h4631], and set[^h6485] men[^h582] by it for to keep[^h8104] them:
###### 19
And stay[^h5975] ye not, but pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] your enemies[^h341], and smite the hindmost[^h2179] of them; suffer[^h5414] them not to enter[^h935] into their cities[^h5892]: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] them into your hand[^h3027]. 
###### 20
And it came to pass, when Joshua[^h3091] and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] had made an end[^h3615] of slaying[^h5221] them with a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347], till they were consumed[^h8552], that the rest[^h8300] which remained[^h8277] of them entered[^h935] into fenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892].
###### 21
And all the people[^h5971] returned[^h7725] to the camp[^h4264] to Joshua[^h3091] at Makkedah[^h4719] in peace[^h7965]: none moved[^h2782] his tongue[^h3956] against any[^h376] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 22
Then said[^h559] Joshua[^h3091], Open[^h6605] the mouth[^h6310] of the cave[^h4631], and bring out[^h3318] those five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] unto me out of the cave[^h4631].
###### 23
And they did[^h6213] so, and brought forth[^h3318] those five[^h2568] kings[^h4428] unto him out of the cave[^h4631], the king[^h4428] of Jerusalem[^h3389], the king[^h4428] of Hebron[^h2275], the king[^h4428] of Jarmuth[^h3412], the king[^h4428] of Lachish[^h3923], and the king[^h4428] of Eglon[^h5700].
###### 24
And it came to pass, when they brought out[^h3318] those kings[^h4428] unto Joshua[^h3091], that Joshua[^h3091] called[^h7121] for all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto the captains[^h7101] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] which went[^h1980] with him, Come near[^h7126], put[^h7760] your feet[^h7272] upon the necks[^h6677] of these kings[^h4428]. And they came near[^h7126], and put[^h7760] their feet[^h7272] upon the necks[^h6677] of them.
###### 25
And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto them, Fear[^h3372] not, nor be dismayed[^h2865], be strong[^h2388] and of good courage[^h553]: for thus shall the LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] to all your enemies[^h341] against whom ye fight[^h3898].
###### 26
And afterward[^h310] Joshua[^h3091] smote[^h5221] them, and slew[^h4191] them, and hanged[^h8518] them on five[^h2568] trees[^h6086]: and they were hanging[^h8518] upon the trees[^h6086] until the evening[^h6153].
###### 27
And it came to pass at the time[^h6256] of the going down[^h935] of the sun[^h8121], that Joshua[^h3091] commanded[^h6680], and they took them down[^h3381] off the trees[^h6086], and cast[^h7993] them into the cave[^h4631] wherein they had been hid[^h2244], and laid[^h7760] great[^h1419] stones[^h68] in the cave's[^h4631] mouth[^h6310], which remain until this very[^h6106] day[^h3117].
###### 28
And that day[^h3117] Joshua[^h3091] took[^h3920] Makkedah[^h4719], and smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and the king[^h4428] thereof he utterly destroyed[^h2763], them, and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein; he let[^h7604] none remain[^h8300]: and he did[^h6213] to the king[^h4428] of Makkedah[^h4719] as he did[^h6213] unto the king[^h4428] of Jericho[^h3405].
###### 29
Then Joshua[^h3091] passed[^h5674] from Makkedah[^h4719], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, unto Libnah[^h3841], and fought[^h3898] against Libnah[^h3841]:
###### 30
And the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] it also, and the king[^h4428] thereof, into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478]; and he smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein; he let[^h7604] none remain[^h8300] in it; but did[^h6213] unto the king[^h4428] thereof as he did[^h6213] unto the king[^h4428] of Jericho[^h3405].
###### 31
And Joshua[^h3091] passed[^h5674] from Libnah[^h3841], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, unto Lachish[^h3923], and encamped[^h2583] against it, and fought[^h3898] against it:
###### 32
And the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] Lachish[^h3923] into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478], which took[^h3920] it on the second[^h8145] day[^h3117], and smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein, according to all that he had done[^h6213] to Libnah[^h3841].
###### 33
Then Horam[^h2036] king[^h4428] of Gezer[^h1507] came up[^h5927] to help[^h5826] Lachish[^h3923]; and Joshua[^h3091] smote[^h5221] him and his people[^h5971], until he had left[^h7604] him none remaining[^h8300].
###### 34
And from Lachish[^h3923] Joshua[^h3091] passed[^h5674] unto Eglon[^h5700], and all Israel[^h3478] with him; and they encamped[^h2583] against it, and fought[^h3898] against it:
###### 35
And they took[^h3920] it on that day[^h3117], and smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein he utterly destroyed[^h2763] that day[^h3117], according to all that he had done[^h6213] to Lachish[^h3923].
###### 36
And Joshua[^h3091] went up[^h5927] from Eglon[^h5700], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, unto Hebron[^h2275]; and they fought[^h3898] against it:
###### 37
And they took[^h3920] it, and smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and the king[^h4428] thereof, and all the cities[^h5892] thereof, and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein; he left[^h7604] none remaining[^h8300], according to all that he had done[^h6213] to Eglon[^h5700]; but destroyed[^h2763] it utterly, and all the souls[^h5315] that were therein.
###### 38
And Joshua[^h3091] returned[^h7725], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, to Debir[^h1688]; and fought[^h3898] against it:
###### 39
And he took[^h3920] it, and the king[^h4428] thereof, and all the cities[^h5892] thereof; and they smote[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and utterly destroyed[^h2763] all the souls[^h5315] that were therein; he left[^h7604] none remaining[^h8300]: as he had done[^h6213] to Hebron[^h2275], so he did[^h6213] to Debir[^h1688], and to the king[^h4428] thereof; as he had done[^h6213] also to Libnah[^h3841], and to her king[^h4428].
###### 40
So Joshua[^h3091] smote[^h5221] all the country[^h776] of the hills[^h2022], and of the south[^h5045], and of the vale[^h8219], and of the springs[^h794], and all their kings[^h4428]: he left[^h7604] none remaining[^h8300], but utterly destroyed[^h2763] all that breathed[^h5397], as the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] commanded[^h6680].
###### 41
And Joshua[^h3091] smote[^h5221] them from Kadeshbarnea[^h6947] even unto Gaza[^h5804], and all the country[^h776] of Goshen[^h1657], even unto Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 42
And all these kings[^h4428] and their land[^h776] did Joshua[^h3091] take[^h3920] at one[^h259] time[^h6471], because the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] fought[^h3898] for Israel[^h3478].
###### 43
And Joshua[^h3091] returned[^h7725], and all Israel[^h3478] with him, unto the camp[^h4264] to Gilgal[^h1537].

###### 1
And it came to pass, when all the kings[^h4428] which were on this side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], in the hills[^h2022], and in the valleys[^h8219], and in all the coasts[^h2348] of the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220] over against[^h4136] Lebanon[^h3844], the Hittite[^h2850], and the Amorite[^h567], the Canaanite[^h3669], the Perizzite[^h6522], the Hivite[^h2340], and the Jebusite[^h2983], heard[^h8085] thereof;
###### 2
That they gathered[^h6908] themselves together[^h3162], to fight[^h3898] with Joshua[^h3091] and with Israel[^h3478], with one[^h259] accord[^h6310]. 
###### 3
And when the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gibeon[^h1391] heard[^h8085] what Joshua[^h3091] had done[^h6213] unto Jericho[^h3405] and to Ai[^h5857],
###### 4
They did work[^h6213] wilily[^h6195], and went[^h3212] and made as if they had been ambassadors[^h6737], and took[^h3947] old[^h1087] sacks[^h8242] upon their asses[^h2543], and wine[^h3196] bottles[^h4997], old[^h1087], and rent[^h1234], and bound up[^h6887];
###### 5
And old[^h1087] shoes[^h5275] and clouted[^h2921] upon their feet[^h7272], and old[^h1087] garments[^h8008] upon them; and all the bread[^h3899] of their provision[^h6718] was dry[^h3001] and mouldy[^h5350].
###### 6
And they went[^h3212] to Joshua[^h3091] unto the camp[^h4264] at Gilgal[^h1537], and said[^h559] unto him, and to the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], We be come[^h935] from a far[^h7350] country[^h776]: now therefore make[^h3772] ye a league[^h1285] with us.
###### 7
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto the Hivites[^h2340], Peradventure[^h194] ye dwell[^h3427] among[^h7130] us; and how shall we make[^h3772] a league[^h1285] with you?
###### 8
And they said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], We are thy servants[^h5650]. And Joshua[^h3091] said[^h559] unto them, Who are ye? and from whence[^h370] come[^h935] ye?
###### 9
And they said[^h559] unto him, From a very[^h3966] far[^h7350] country[^h776] thy servants[^h5650] are come[^h935] because of the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]: for we have heard[^h8085] the fame[^h8089] of him, and all that he did[^h6213] in Egypt[^h4714],
###### 10
And all that he did[^h6213] to the two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], that were beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], to Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809], and to Og[^h5747] king[^h4428] of Bashan[^h1316], which was at Ashtaroth[^h6252].
###### 11
Wherefore our elders[^h2205] and all the inhabitants[^h3427] of our country[^h776] spake[^h559] to us, saying[^h559], Take[^h3947] victuals[^h6720] with you[^h3027] for the journey[^h1870], and go[^h3212] to meet[^h7125] them, and say[^h559] unto them, We are your servants[^h5650]: therefore now make[^h3772] ye a league[^h1285] with us. 
###### 12
This our bread[^h3899] we took hot[^h2525] for our provision[^h6679] out of our houses[^h1004] on the day[^h3117] we came forth[^h3318] to go[^h3212] unto you; but now, behold, it is dry[^h3001], and it is mouldy[^h5350]:
###### 13
And these bottles[^h4997] of wine[^h3196], which we filled[^h4390], were new[^h2319]; and, behold, they be rent[^h1234]: and these our garments[^h8008] and our shoes[^h5275] are become old[^h1086] by reason of the very[^h3966] long[^h7230] journey[^h1870].
###### 14
And the men[^h582] took[^h3947] of their victuals[^h6718], and asked[^h7592] not counsel at the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 15
And Joshua[^h3091] made[^h6213] peace[^h7965] with them, and made[^h3772] a league[^h1285] with them, to let them live[^h2421]: and the princes[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712] sware[^h7650] unto them.
###### 16
And it came to pass at the end[^h7097] of three[^h7969] days[^h3117] after[^h310] they had made[^h3772] a league[^h1285] with them, that they heard[^h8085] that they were their neighbours[^h7138], and that they dwelt[^h3427] among[^h7130] them.
###### 17
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] journeyed[^h5265], and came[^h935] unto their cities[^h5892] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117]. Now their cities[^h5892] were Gibeon[^h1391], and Chephirah[^h3716], and Beeroth[^h881], and Kirjathjearim[^h7157].
###### 18
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] smote[^h5221] them not, because the princes[^h5387] of the congregation[^h5712] had sworn[^h7650] unto them by the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]. And all the congregation[^h5712] murmured[^h3885] against the princes[^h5387].
###### 19
But all the princes[^h5387] said[^h559] unto all the congregation[^h5712], We have sworn[^h7650] unto them by the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]: now therefore we may[^h3201] not touch[^h5060] them.
###### 20
This we will do[^h6213] to them; we will even let them live[^h2421], lest wrath[^h7110] be upon us, because of the oath[^h7621] which we sware[^h7650] unto them.
###### 21
And the princes[^h5387] said[^h559] unto them, Let them live[^h2421]; but let them be hewers[^h2404] of wood[^h6086] and drawers[^h7579] of water[^h4325] unto all the congregation[^h5712]; as the princes[^h5387] had promised[^h1696] them.
###### 22
And Joshua[^h3091] called[^h7121] for them, and he spake[^h1696] unto them, saying[^h559], Wherefore have ye beguiled[^h7411] us, saying[^h559], We are very[^h3966] far[^h7350] from you; when ye dwell[^h3427] among[^h7130] us?
###### 23
Now therefore ye are cursed[^h779], and there shall none of you be freed[^h3772] from being bondmen[^h5650], and hewers[^h2404] of wood[^h6086] and drawers[^h7579] of water[^h4325] for the house[^h1004] of my God[^h430]. 
###### 24
And they answered[^h6030] Joshua[^h3091], and said[^h559], Because it was certainly[^h5046] told[^h5046] thy servants[^h5650], how that the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] commanded[^h6680] his servant[^h5650] Moses[^h4872] to give[^h5414] you all the land[^h776], and to destroy[^h8045] all the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] from before[^h6440] you, therefore we were sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372] of our lives[^h5315] because[^h6440] of you, and have done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 25
And now, behold, we[^h2009] are in thine hand[^h3027]: as it seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] and right[^h3477] unto thee to do[^h6213] unto us, do[^h6213].
###### 26
And so did[^h6213] he unto them, and delivered[^h5337] them out of the hand[^h3027] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that they slew[^h2026] them not.
###### 27
And Joshua[^h3091] made[^h5414] them that day[^h3117] hewers[^h2404] of wood[^h6086] and drawers[^h7579] of water[^h4325] for the congregation[^h5712], and for the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068], even unto this day[^h3117], in the place[^h4725] which he should choose[^h977].

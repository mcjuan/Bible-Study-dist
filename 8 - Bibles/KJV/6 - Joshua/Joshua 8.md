###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Fear[^h3372] not, neither be thou dismayed[^h2865]: take[^h3947] all the people[^h5971] of war[^h4421] with thee, and arise[^h6965], go up[^h5927] to Ai[^h5857]: see[^h7200], I have given[^h5414] into thy hand[^h3027] the king[^h4428] of Ai[^h5857], and his people[^h5971], and his city[^h5892], and his land[^h776]:
###### 2
And thou shalt do[^h6213] to Ai[^h5857] and her king[^h4428] as thou didst[^h6213] unto Jericho[^h3405] and her king[^h4428]: only the spoil[^h7998] thereof, and the cattle[^h929] thereof, shall ye take for a prey[^h962] unto yourselves: lay[^h7760] thee an ambush[^h693] for the city[^h5892] behind[^h310] it.
###### 3
So Joshua[^h3091] arose[^h6965], and all the people[^h5971] of war[^h4421], to go up[^h5927] against Ai[^h5857]: and Joshua[^h3091] chose out[^h977] thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] mighty[^h1368] men[^h376] of valour[^h2428], and sent them away[^h7971] by night[^h3915].
###### 4
And he commanded[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], Behold[^h7200], ye shall lie in wait[^h693] against the city[^h5892], even behind[^h310] the city[^h5892]: go[^h7368] not very[^h3966] far[^h7368] from the city[^h5892], but be ye all ready[^h3559]:
###### 5
And I, and all the people[^h5971] that are with me, will approach[^h7126] unto the city[^h5892]: and it shall come to pass, when they come out[^h3318] against[^h7125] us, as at the first[^h7223], that we will flee[^h5127] before[^h6440] them,
###### 6
(For they will come out[^h3318] after[^h310] us) till we have drawn[^h5423] them from the city[^h5892]; for they will say[^h559], They flee[^h5127] before[^h6440] us, as at the first[^h7223]: therefore we will flee[^h5127] before[^h6440] them. 
###### 7
Then ye shall rise up[^h6965] from the ambush[^h693], and seize[^h3423] upon the city[^h5892]: for the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] will deliver[^h5414] it into your hand[^h3027].
###### 8
And it shall be, when ye have taken[^h8610] the city[^h5892], that ye shall set[^h3341] the city[^h5892] on fire[^h784]: according to the commandment[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] shall ye do[^h6213]. See[^h7200], I have commanded[^h6680] you.
###### 9
Joshua[^h3091] therefore sent them forth[^h7971]: and they went[^h3212] to lie in ambush[^h3993], and abode[^h3427] between Bethel[^h1008] and Ai[^h5857], on the west side[^h3220] of Ai[^h5857]: but Joshua[^h3091] lodged[^h3885] that night[^h3915] among[^h8432] the people[^h5971].
###### 10
And Joshua[^h3091] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and numbered[^h6485] the people[^h5971], and went up[^h5927], he and the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], before[^h6440] the people[^h5971] to Ai[^h5857].
###### 11
And all the people[^h5971], even the people of war[^h4421] that were with him, went up[^h5927], and drew nigh[^h5066], and came[^h935] before the city[^h5892], and pitched[^h2583] on the north side[^h6828] of Ai[^h5857]: now there was a valley[^h1516] between them and Ai[^h5857].
###### 12
And he took[^h3947] about five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] men[^h376], and set[^h7760] them to lie in ambush[^h693] between Bethel[^h1008] and Ai[^h5857], on the west side[^h3220] of the city[^h5857] [^h5892]. 
###### 13
And when they had set[^h7760] the people[^h5971], even all the host[^h4264] that was on the north[^h6828] of the city[^h5892], and their liers in wait[^h6119] on the west[^h3220] of the city[^h5892], Joshua[^h3091] went[^h3212] that night[^h3915] into the midst[^h8432] of the valley[^h6010]. 
###### 14
And it came to pass, when the king[^h4428] of Ai[^h5857] saw[^h7200] it, that they hasted[^h4116] and rose up early[^h7925], and the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] Israel[^h3478] to battle[^h4421], he and all his people[^h5971], at a time appointed[^h4150], before[^h6440] the plain[^h6160]; but he wist[^h3045] not that there were liers in ambush[^h693] against him behind[^h310] the city[^h5892].
###### 15
And Joshua[^h3091] and all Israel[^h3478] made as if they were beaten[^h5060] before[^h6440] them, and fled[^h5127] by the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 16
And all the people[^h5971] that were in Ai[^h5857] [^h5892] were called[^h2199] together to pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] them: and they pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] Joshua[^h3091], and were drawn away[^h5423] from the city[^h5892].
###### 17
And there was not a man[^h376] left[^h7604] in Ai[^h5857] or Bethel[^h1008], that went not out[^h3318] after[^h310] Israel[^h3478]: and they left[^h5800] the city[^h5892] open[^h6605], and pursued[^h7291] after Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Joshua[^h3091], Stretch out[^h5186] the spear[^h3591] that is in thy hand[^h3027] toward Ai[^h5857]; for I will give[^h5414] it into thine hand[^h3027]. And Joshua[^h3091] stretched out[^h5186] the spear[^h3591] that he had in his hand[^h3027] toward the city[^h5892].
###### 19
And the ambush[^h693] arose[^h6965] quickly[^h4120] out of their place[^h4725], and they ran[^h7323] as soon as he had stretched out[^h5186] his hand[^h3027]: and they entered[^h935] into the city[^h5892], and took[^h3920] it, and hasted[^h4116] and set[^h3341] the city[^h5892] on fire[^h784].
###### 20
And when the men[^h582] of Ai[^h5857] looked[^h6437] behind[^h310] them, they saw[^h7200], and, behold, the smoke[^h6227] of the city[^h5892] ascended up[^h5927] to heaven[^h8064], and they had no power[^h3027] to flee[^h5127] this way or that way[^h2008]: and the people[^h5971] that fled[^h5127] to the wilderness[^h4057] turned back[^h2015] upon the pursuers[^h7291]. 
###### 21
And when Joshua[^h3091] and all Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that the ambush[^h693] had taken[^h3920] the city[^h5892], and that the smoke[^h6227] of the city[^h5892] ascended[^h5927], then they turned again[^h7725], and slew[^h5221] the men[^h582] of Ai[^h5857].
###### 22
And the other[^h428] issued out[^h3318] of the city[^h5892] against[^h7125] them; so they were in the midst[^h8432] of Israel[^h3478], some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote[^h5221] them, so that[^h5704] they let[^h7604] none of them remain[^h8300] or escape[^h6412].
###### 23
And the king[^h4428] of Ai[^h5857] they took[^h8610] alive[^h2416], and brought[^h7126] him to Joshua[^h3091].
###### 24
And it came to pass, when Israel[^h3478] had made an end[^h3615] of slaying[^h2026] all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Ai[^h5857] in the field[^h7704], in the wilderness[^h4057] wherein they chased[^h7291] them, and when they were all fallen[^h5307] on the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], until they were consumed[^h8552], that all the Israelites[^h3478] returned[^h7725] unto Ai[^h5857], and smote[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719].
###### 25
And so it was, that all that fell[^h5307] that day[^h3117], both of men[^h376] and women[^h802], were twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505], even all the men[^h582] of Ai[^h5857].
###### 26
For Joshua[^h3091] drew[^h7725] not his hand[^h3027] back[^h7725], wherewith he stretched out[^h5186] the spear[^h3591], until he had utterly destroyed[^h2763] all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Ai[^h5857].
###### 27
Only the cattle[^h929] and the spoil[^h7998] of that city[^h5892] Israel[^h3478] took for a prey[^h962] unto themselves, according unto the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] which he commanded[^h6680] Joshua[^h3091].
###### 28
And Joshua[^h3091] burnt[^h8313] Ai[^h5857], and made[^h7760] it an heap[^h8510] for ever[^h5769], even a desolation[^h8077] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 29
And the king[^h4428] of Ai[^h5857] he hanged[^h8518] on a tree[^h6086] until eventide[^h6256] [^h6153]: and as soon as the sun[^h8121] was down[^h935], Joshua[^h3091] commanded[^h6680] that they should take[^h3381] his carcase[^h5038] down[^h3381] from the tree[^h6086], and cast[^h7993] it at the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892], and raise[^h6965] thereon a great[^h1419] heap[^h1530] of stones[^h68], that remaineth unto this day[^h3117].
###### 30
Then Joshua[^h3091] built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] in mount[^h2022] Ebal[^h5858],
###### 31
As Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], as it is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], an altar[^h4196] of whole[^h8003] stones[^h68], over which no man hath lift up[^h5130] any iron[^h1270]: and they offered[^h5927] thereon burnt offerings[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068], and sacrificed[^h2076] peace offerings[^h8002].
###### 32
And he wrote[^h3789] there upon the stones[^h68] a copy[^h4932] of the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], which he wrote[^h3789] in the presence[^h6440] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 33
And all Israel[^h3478], and their elders[^h2205], and officers[^h7860], and their judges[^h8199], stood[^h5975] on this side the ark[^h727] and on that side before the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881], which bare[^h5375] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068], as well the stranger[^h1616], as he that was born[^h249] among them; half[^h2677] of them over[^h413] against[^h4136] mount[^h2022] Gerizim[^h1630], and half[^h2677] of them over against[^h4136] mount[^h2022] Ebal[^h5858]; as Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] before[^h7223], that they should bless[^h1288] the people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 34
And afterward[^h310] he read[^h7121] all the words[^h1697] of the law[^h8451], the blessings[^h1293] and cursings[^h7045], according to all that is written[^h3789] in the book[^h5612] of the law[^h8451].
###### 35
There was not a word[^h1697] of all that Moses[^h4872] commanded[^h6680], which Joshua[^h3091] read[^h7121] not before all the congregation[^h6951] of Israel[^h3478], with the women[^h802], and the little ones[^h2945], and the strangers[^h1616] that were conversant[^h1980] among[^h7130] them.

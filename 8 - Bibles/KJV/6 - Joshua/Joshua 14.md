###### 1
And these are the countries which the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] inherited[^h5157] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], which Eleazar[^h499] the priest[^h3548], and Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], and the heads[^h7218] of the fathers[^h1] of the tribes[^h4294] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], distributed for inheritance[^h5157] to them.
###### 2
By lot[^h1486] was their inheritance[^h5159], as the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872], for the nine[^h8672] tribes[^h4294], and for the half[^h2677] tribe[^h4294].
###### 3
For Moses[^h4872] had given[^h5414] the inheritance[^h5159] of two[^h8147] tribes[^h4294] and an half[^h2677] tribe[^h4294] on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]: but unto the Levites[^h3881] he gave[^h5414] none inheritance[^h5159] among[^h8432] them.
###### 4
For the children[^h1121] of Joseph[^h3130] were two[^h8147] tribes[^h4294], Manasseh[^h4519] and Ephraim[^h669]: therefore they gave[^h5414] no part[^h2506] unto the Levites[^h3881] in the land[^h776], save cities[^h5892] to dwell[^h3427] in, with their suburbs[^h4054] for their cattle[^h4735] and for their substance[^h7075].
###### 5
As the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] Moses[^h4872], so the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213], and they divided[^h2505] the land[^h776].
###### 6
Then the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] came[^h5066] unto Joshua[^h3091] in Gilgal[^h1537]: and Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312] the Kenezite[^h7074] said[^h559] unto him, Thou knowest[^h3045] the thing[^h1697] that the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696] unto Moses[^h4872] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] concerning me[^h182] and thee[^h182] in Kadeshbarnea[^h6947].
###### 7
Forty[^h705] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] was I when Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] me from Kadeshbarnea[^h6947] to espy out[^h7270] the land[^h776]; and I brought[^h7725] him word[^h1697] again[^h7725] as it was in mine heart[^h3824].
###### 8
Nevertheless my brethren[^h251] that went up[^h5927] with me made the heart[^h3820] of the people[^h5971] melt[^h4529]: but I wholly[^h4390] followed[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430].
###### 9
And Moses[^h4872] sware[^h7650] on that day[^h3117], saying[^h559], Surely the land[^h776] whereon thy feet[^h7272] have trodden[^h1869] shall be thine inheritance[^h5159], and thy children's[^h1121] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769], because thou hast wholly[^h4390] followed[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430].
###### 10
And now, behold, the LORD[^h3068] hath kept me alive[^h2421], as he said[^h1696], these forty[^h705] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141], even since[^h227] the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] this word[^h1697] unto Moses[^h4872], while the children of Israel[^h3478] wandered[^h1980] in the wilderness[^h4057]: and now, lo, I am this day[^h3117] fourscore[^h8084] and five[^h2568] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]. 
###### 11
As yet I am as strong[^h2389] this day[^h3117] as I was in the day[^h3117] that Moses[^h4872] sent[^h7971] me: as my strength[^h3581] was then, even so is my strength[^h3581] now, for war[^h4421], both to go out[^h3318], and to come in[^h935].
###### 12
Now therefore give[^h5414] me this mountain[^h2022], whereof the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] in that day[^h3117]; for thou heardest[^h8085] in that day[^h3117] how the Anakims[^h6062] were there, and that the cities[^h5892] were great[^h1419] and fenced[^h1219]: if so be[^h194] the LORD[^h3068] will be with[^h854] me, then I shall be able to drive them out[^h3423], as the LORD[^h3068] said[^h1696].
###### 13
And Joshua[^h3091] blessed[^h1288] him, and gave[^h5414] unto Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312] Hebron[^h2275] for an inheritance[^h5159].
###### 14
Hebron[^h2275] therefore became the inheritance[^h5159] of Caleb[^h3612] the son[^h1121] of Jephunneh[^h3312] the Kenezite[^h7074] unto this day[^h3117], because that he wholly[^h4390] followed[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 15
And the name[^h8034] of Hebron[^h2275] before[^h6440] was Kirjatharba[^h7153]; which Arba was a great[^h1419] man[^h120] among the Anakims[^h6062]. And the land[^h776] had rest[^h8252] from war[^h4421].

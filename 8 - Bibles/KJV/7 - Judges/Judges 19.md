###### 1
And it came to pass in those days[^h3117], when there was no king[^h4428] in Israel[^h3478], that there was a certain[^h376] Levite[^h3881] sojourning[^h1481] on the side[^h3411] of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], who took[^h3947] to him a concubine[^h802] [^h6370] out of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063]. 
###### 2
And his concubine[^h6370] played the whore[^h2181] against him, and went away[^h3212] from him unto her father's[^h1] house[^h1004] to Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063], and was there four[^h702] whole months[^h2320] [^h3117]. 
###### 3
And her husband[^h376] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] after[^h310] her, to speak[^h1696] friendly[^h3820] unto her, and to bring her again[^h7725], having his servant[^h5288] with him, and a couple[^h6776] of asses[^h2543]: and she brought[^h935] him into her father's[^h1] house[^h1004]: and when the father[^h1] of the damsel[^h5291] saw[^h7200] him, he rejoiced[^h8055] to meet[^h7125] him. 
###### 4
And his father in law[^h2859], the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1], retained[^h2388] him; and he abode[^h3427] with him three[^h7969] days[^h3117]: so they did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and lodged[^h3885] there.
###### 5
And it came to pass on the fourth[^h7243] day[^h3117], when they arose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], that he rose up[^h6965] to depart[^h3212]: and the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1] said[^h559] unto his son in law[^h2860], Comfort[^h5582] thine heart[^h3820] with a morsel[^h6595] of bread[^h3899], and afterward[^h310] go your way[^h3212]. 
###### 6
And they sat down[^h3427], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354] both[^h8147] of them together[^h3162]: for the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1] had said[^h559] unto the man[^h376], Be content[^h2974], I pray thee, and tarry all night[^h3885], and let thine heart[^h3820] be merry[^h3190].
###### 7
And when the man[^h376] rose up[^h6965] to depart[^h3212], his father in law[^h2859] urged[^h6484] him: therefore he lodged[^h3885] there again[^h7725].
###### 8
And he arose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242] on the fifth[^h2549] day[^h3117] to depart[^h3212]: and the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1] said[^h559], Comfort[^h5582] thine heart[^h3824], I pray thee. And they tarried[^h4102] until afternoon[^h3117] [^h5186], and they did eat[^h398] both[^h8147] of them. 
###### 9
And when the man[^h376] rose up[^h6965] to depart[^h3212], he, and his concubine[^h6370], and his servant[^h5288], his father in law[^h2859], the damsel's[^h5291] father[^h1], said[^h559] unto him, Behold, now the day[^h3117] draweth[^h7503] toward evening[^h6150], I pray you tarry all night[^h3885]: behold, the day[^h3117] groweth to an end[^h2583], lodge[^h3885] here, that thine heart[^h3824] may be merry[^h3190]; and to morrow[^h4279] get you early[^h7925] on your way[^h1870], that thou mayest go[^h1980] home[^h168].   
###### 10
But the man[^h376] would[^h14] not tarry that night[^h3885], but he rose up[^h6965] and departed[^h3212], and came[^h935] over against[^h5227] Jebus[^h2982], which is Jerusalem[^h3389]; and there were with him two[^h6776] asses[^h2543] saddled[^h2280], his concubine[^h6370] also was with him. 
###### 11
And when they were by Jebus[^h2982], the day[^h3117] was far[^h3966] spent[^h7286]; and the servant[^h5288] said[^h559] unto his master[^h113], Come[^h3212], I pray thee, and let us turn in[^h5493] into this city[^h5892] of the Jebusites[^h2983], and lodge[^h3885] in it.
###### 12
And his master[^h113] said[^h559] unto him, We will not turn aside[^h5493] hither into the city[^h5892] of a stranger[^h5237], that is not of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; we will pass over[^h5674] to Gibeah[^h1390].
###### 13
And he said[^h559] unto his servant[^h5288], Come[^h3212], and let us draw near[^h7126] to one[^h259] of these places[^h4725] to lodge all night[^h3885], in Gibeah[^h1390], or in Ramah[^h7414].
###### 14
And they passed on[^h5674] and went their way[^h3212]; and the sun[^h8121] went down[^h935] upon them when they were by[^h681] Gibeah[^h1390], which belongeth to Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 15
And they turned aside[^h5493] thither, to go in[^h935] and to lodge[^h3885] in Gibeah[^h1390]: and when he went in[^h935], he sat him down[^h3427] in a street[^h7339] of the city[^h5892]: for there was no man[^h376] that took[^h622] them into his house[^h1004] to lodging[^h3885].
###### 16
And, behold, there came[^h935] an old[^h2205] man[^h376] from his work[^h4639] out of the field[^h7704] at even[^h6153], which was also[^h376] of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669]; and he sojourned[^h1481] in Gibeah[^h1390]: but the men[^h582] of the place[^h4725] were Benjamites[^h1145].
###### 17
And when he had lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869], he saw[^h7200] a wayfaring[^h732] man[^h376] in the street[^h7339] of the city[^h5892]: and the old[^h2205] man[^h376] said[^h559], Whither goest[^h3212] thou? and whence[^h370] comest[^h935] thou?
###### 18
And he said[^h559] unto him, We are passing[^h5674] from Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063] toward the side[^h3411] of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669]; from thence am I: and I went[^h3212] to Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063], but I am now going[^h1980] to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]; and there is no man[^h376] that receiveth[^h622] me to house[^h1004]. 
###### 19
Yet there is[^h3426] both straw[^h8401] and provender[^h4554] for our asses[^h2543]; and there is bread[^h3899] and wine[^h3196] also for me, and for thy handmaid[^h519], and for the young man[^h5288] which is with thy servants[^h5650]: there is no want[^h4270] of any thing[^h1697].
###### 20
And the old[^h2205] man[^h376] said[^h559], Peace[^h7965] be with thee; howsoever[^h7535] let all thy wants[^h4270] lie upon me; only lodge[^h3885] not in the street[^h7339].
###### 21
So he brought[^h935] him into his house[^h1004], and gave provender[^h1101] unto the asses[^h2543]: and they washed[^h7364] their feet[^h7272], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354].
###### 22
Now as they were making their hearts[^h3820] merry[^h3190], behold, the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892], certain[^h582] sons[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], beset[^h5437] the house[^h1004] round about[^h5437], and beat[^h1849] at the door[^h1817], and spake[^h559] to the master[^h1167] of the house[^h1004], the old[^h2205] man[^h376], saying[^h559], Bring forth[^h3318] the man[^h376] that came[^h935] into thine house[^h1004], that we may know[^h3045] him.
###### 23
And the man[^h376], the master[^h1167] of the house[^h1004], went out[^h3318] unto them, and said[^h559] unto them, Nay[^h408], my brethren[^h251], nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly[^h7489]; seeing[^h310] that this man[^h376] is come[^h935] into mine house[^h1004], do[^h6213] not this folly[^h5039].
###### 24
Behold, here is my daughter[^h1323] a maiden[^h1330], and his concubine[^h6370]; them I will bring out[^h3318] now, and humble[^h6031] ye them, and do[^h6213] with them what seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto you: but unto this man[^h376] do[^h6213] not so[^h2063] vile[^h5039] a thing[^h1697]. 
###### 25
But the men[^h582] would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] to him: so the man[^h376] took[^h2388] his concubine[^h6370], and brought[^h3318] her forth[^h2351] unto them; and they knew[^h3045] her, and abused[^h5953] her all the night[^h3915] until the morning[^h1242]: and when the day[^h7837] began to spring[^h5927], they let her go[^h7971].
###### 26
Then came[^h935] the woman[^h802] in the dawning[^h6437] of the day[^h1242], and fell down[^h5307] at the door[^h6607] of the man's[^h376] house[^h1004] where her lord[^h113] was, till it was light[^h216].
###### 27
And her lord[^h113] rose up[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242], and opened[^h6605] the doors[^h1817] of the house[^h1004], and went out[^h3318] to go[^h3212] his way[^h1870]: and, behold, the woman[^h802] his concubine[^h6370] was fallen down[^h5307] at the door[^h6607] of the house[^h1004], and her hands[^h3027] were upon the threshold[^h5592].
###### 28
And he said[^h559] unto her, Up[^h6965], and let us be going[^h3212]. But none answered[^h6030]. Then the man[^h376] took[^h3947] her up upon an ass[^h2543], and the man[^h376] rose up[^h6965], and gat[^h3212] him unto his place[^h4725].
###### 29
And when he was come[^h935] into his house[^h1004], he took[^h3947] a knife[^h3979], and laid hold[^h2388] on his concubine[^h6370], and divided[^h5408] her, together with her bones[^h6106], into twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] pieces[^h5409], and sent[^h7971] her into all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 30
And it was so[^h1961], that all that saw[^h7200] it said[^h559], There was no such deed[^h2063] done nor seen[^h7200] from the day[^h3117] that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] unto this day[^h3117]: consider[^h7760] of it, take advice[^h5779], and speak[^h1696] your minds.

###### 1
And Abimelech[^h40] the son[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378] went[^h3212] to Shechem[^h7927] unto his mother's[^h517] brethren[^h251], and communed[^h1696] with them, and with all the family[^h4940] of the house[^h1004] of his mother's[^h517] father[^h1], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Speak[^h1696], I pray you, in the ears[^h241] of all the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], Whether is better[^h2896] for you, either that all the sons[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378], which are threescore and ten[^h7657] persons[^h376], reign[^h4910] over you, or that one[^h259] reign[^h4910] over you? remember[^h2142] also that I am your bone[^h6106] and your flesh[^h1320]. 
###### 3
And his mother's[^h517] brethren[^h251] spake[^h1696] of him in the ears[^h241] of all the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927] all these words[^h1697]: and their hearts[^h3820] inclined[^h5186] to follow[^h310] Abimelech[^h40]; for they said[^h559], He is our brother[^h251]. 
###### 4
And they gave[^h5414] him threescore and ten[^h7657] pieces of silver[^h3701] out of the house[^h1004] of Baalberith[^h1170], wherewith Abimelech[^h40] hired[^h7936] vain[^h7386] and light[^h6348] persons[^h582], which followed[^h3212] him[^h310].
###### 5
And he went[^h935] unto his father's[^h1] house[^h1004] at Ophrah[^h6084], and slew[^h2026] his brethren[^h251] the sons[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378], being threescore and ten[^h7657] persons[^h376], upon one[^h259] stone[^h68]: notwithstanding yet Jotham[^h3147] the youngest[^h6996] son[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378] was left[^h3498]; for he hid[^h2244] himself.
###### 6
And all the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927] gathered together[^h622], and all the house[^h1004] of Millo[^h4407] [^h1037], and went[^h3212], and made[^h4427] Abimelech[^h40] king[^h4428], by the plain[^h436] of the pillar[^h5324] that was in Shechem[^h7927]. 
###### 7
And when they told[^h5046] it to Jotham[^h3147], he went[^h3212] and stood[^h5975] in the top[^h7218] of mount[^h2022] Gerizim[^h1630], and lifted up[^h5375] his voice[^h6963], and cried[^h7121], and said[^h559] unto them, Hearken[^h8085] unto me, ye men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], that God[^h430] may hearken[^h8085] unto you.
###### 8
The trees[^h6086] went forth[^h1980] [^h1980] on a time to anoint[^h4886] a king[^h4428] over them; and they said[^h559] unto the olive tree[^h2132], Reign[^h4427] thou over us.
###### 9
But the olive tree[^h2132] said[^h559] unto them, Should I leave[^h2308] my fatness[^h1880], wherewith by me they honour[^h3513] God[^h430] and man[^h582], and go[^h1980] to be promoted[^h5128] over the trees[^h6086]? 
###### 10
And the trees[^h6086] said[^h559] to the fig tree[^h8384], Come[^h3212] thou, and reign[^h4427] over us.
###### 11
But the fig tree[^h8384] said[^h559] unto them, Should I forsake[^h2308] my sweetness[^h4987], and my good[^h2896] fruit[^h8570], and go[^h1980] to be promoted[^h5128] over the trees[^h6086]?
###### 12
Then said[^h559] the trees[^h6086] unto the vine[^h1612], Come[^h3212] thou, and reign[^h4427] over us.
###### 13
And the vine[^h1612] said[^h559] unto them, Should I leave[^h2308] my wine[^h8492], which cheereth[^h8055] God[^h430] and man[^h582], and go[^h1980] to be promoted[^h5128] over the trees[^h6086]?
###### 14
Then said[^h559] all the trees[^h6086] unto the bramble[^h329], Come[^h3212] thou, and reign[^h4427] over us. 
###### 15
And the bramble[^h329] said[^h559] unto the trees[^h6086], If in truth[^h571] ye anoint[^h4886] me king[^h4428] over you, then come[^h935] and put your trust[^h2620] in my shadow[^h6738]: and if not, let fire[^h784] come out[^h3318] of the bramble[^h329], and devour[^h398] the cedars[^h730] of Lebanon[^h3844].
###### 16
Now therefore, if ye have done[^h6213] truly[^h571] and sincerely[^h8549], in that ye have made Abimelech[^h40] king[^h4427], and if ye have dealt[^h6213] well[^h2896] with Jerubbaal[^h3378] and his house[^h1004], and have done[^h6213] unto him according to the deserving[^h1576] of his hands[^h3027];
###### 17
(For my father[^h1] fought[^h3898] for you, and adventured[^h7993] his life[^h5315] far[^h5048], and delivered[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of Midian[^h4080]: 
###### 18
And ye are risen up[^h6965] against my father's[^h1] house[^h1004] this day[^h3117], and have slain[^h2026] his sons[^h1121], threescore and ten[^h7657] persons[^h376], upon one[^h259] stone[^h68], and have made Abimelech[^h40], the son[^h1121] of his maidservant[^h519], king[^h4427] over the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], because he is your brother[^h251];)
###### 19
If ye then have dealt[^h6213] truly[^h571] and sincerely[^h8549] with Jerubbaal[^h3378] and with his house[^h1004] this day[^h3117], then rejoice[^h8055] ye in Abimelech[^h40], and let him also rejoice[^h8055] in you:
###### 20
But if not, let fire[^h784] come out[^h3318] from Abimelech[^h40], and devour[^h398] the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], and the house[^h1004] of Millo[^h4407] [^h1037]; and let fire[^h784] come out[^h3318] from the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], and from the house[^h1004] of Millo[^h4407] [^h1037], and devour[^h398] Abimelech[^h40].
###### 21
And Jotham[^h3147] ran away[^h1272], and fled[^h5127], and went[^h3212] to Beer[^h876], and dwelt[^h3427] there, for fear[^h6440] of Abimelech[^h40] his brother[^h251].
###### 22
When Abimelech[^h40] had reigned[^h7786] three[^h7969] years[^h8141] over Israel[^h3478],
###### 23
Then God[^h430] sent[^h7971] an evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] between Abimelech[^h40] and the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927]; and the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927] dealt treacherously[^h898] with Abimelech[^h40]:
###### 24
That the cruelty[^h2555] done to the threescore and ten[^h7657] sons[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378] might come[^h935], and their blood[^h1818] be laid[^h7760] upon Abimelech[^h40] their brother[^h251], which slew[^h2026] them; and upon the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], which aided[^h2388] [^h3027] him in the killing[^h2026] of his brethren[^h251]. 
###### 25
And the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927] set[^h7760] liers in wait[^h693] for him in the top[^h7218] of the mountains[^h2022], and they robbed[^h1497] all that came[^h5674] along that way[^h1870] by them: and it was told[^h5046] Abimelech[^h40].
###### 26
And Gaal[^h1603] the son[^h1121] of Ebed[^h5651] came[^h935] with his brethren[^h251], and went over[^h5674] to Shechem[^h7927]: and the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927] put their confidence[^h982] in him.
###### 27
And they went out[^h3318] into the fields[^h7704], and gathered[^h1219] their vineyards[^h3754], and trode[^h1869] the grapes, and made[^h6213] merry[^h1974], and went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of their god[^h430], and did eat[^h398] and drink[^h8354], and cursed[^h7043] Abimelech[^h40]. 
###### 28
And Gaal[^h1603] the son[^h1121] of Ebed[^h5651] said[^h559], Who is Abimelech[^h40], and who is Shechem[^h7927], that we should serve[^h5647] him? is not he the son[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378]? and Zebul[^h2083] his officer[^h6496]? serve[^h5647] the men[^h582] of Hamor[^h2544] the father[^h1] of Shechem[^h7927]: for why should we serve[^h5647] him?
###### 29
And would to God this people[^h5971] were under[^h5414] my hand[^h3027]! then would I remove[^h5493] Abimelech[^h40]. And he said[^h559] to Abimelech[^h40], Increase[^h7235] thine army[^h6635], and come out[^h3318].
###### 30
And when Zebul[^h2083] the ruler[^h8269] of the city[^h5892] heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of Gaal[^h1603] the son[^h1121] of Ebed[^h5651], his anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734]. 
###### 31
And he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto Abimelech[^h40] privily[^h8649], saying[^h559], Behold, Gaal[^h1603] the son[^h1121] of Ebed[^h5651] and his brethren[^h251] be come[^h935] to Shechem[^h7927]; and, behold, they fortify[^h6696] the city[^h5892] against thee. 
###### 32
Now therefore up[^h6965] by night[^h3915], thou and the people[^h5971] that is with thee, and lie in wait[^h693] in the field[^h7704]:
###### 33
And it shall be, that in the morning[^h1242], as soon as the sun[^h8121] is up[^h2224], thou shalt rise early[^h7925], and set[^h6584] upon the city[^h5892]: and, behold, when he and the people[^h5971] that is with him come out[^h3318] against thee, then mayest thou do[^h6213] to them as thou[^h3027] shalt find occasion[^h4672]. 
###### 34
And Abimelech[^h40] rose up[^h6965], and all the people[^h5971] that were with him, by night[^h3915], and they laid wait[^h693] against Shechem[^h7927] in four[^h702] companies[^h7218].
###### 35
And Gaal[^h1603] the son[^h1121] of Ebed[^h5651] went out[^h3318], and stood[^h5975] in the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892]: and Abimelech[^h40] rose up[^h6965], and the people[^h5971] that were with him, from lying in wait[^h3993].
###### 36
And when Gaal[^h1603] saw[^h7200] the people[^h5971], he said[^h559] to Zebul[^h2083], Behold, there come[^h3381] people[^h5971] down[^h3381] from the top[^h7218] of the mountains[^h2022]. And Zebul[^h2083] said[^h559] unto him, Thou seest[^h7200] the shadow[^h6738] of the mountains[^h2022] as if they were men[^h582].
###### 37
And Gaal[^h1603] spake[^h1696] again[^h3254] and said[^h559], See there come[^h3381] people[^h5971] down[^h3381] by the middle[^h2872] of the land[^h776], and another[^h259] company[^h7218] come[^h935] along by the plain[^h436] of[^h1870] Meonenim[^h6049].  
###### 38
Then said[^h559] Zebul[^h2083] unto him, Where is now[^h645] thy mouth[^h6310], wherewith thou saidst[^h559], Who is Abimelech[^h40], that we should serve[^h5647] him? is not this the people[^h5971] that thou hast despised[^h3988]? go out[^h3318], I pray now[^h4994], and fight[^h3898] with them.
###### 39
And Gaal[^h1603] went out[^h3318] before[^h6440] the men[^h1167] of Shechem[^h7927], and fought[^h3898] with Abimelech[^h40].
###### 40
And Abimelech[^h40] chased[^h7291] him, and he fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] him, and many[^h7227] were overthrown[^h5307] and wounded[^h2491], even unto the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179].
###### 41
And Abimelech[^h40] dwelt[^h3427] at Arumah[^h725]: and Zebul[^h2083] thrust out[^h1644] Gaal[^h1603] and his brethren[^h251], that they should not dwell[^h3427] in Shechem[^h7927].
###### 42
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that the people[^h5971] went out[^h3318] into the field[^h7704]; and they told[^h5046] Abimelech[^h40].
###### 43
And he took[^h3947] the people[^h5971], and divided[^h2673] them into three[^h7969] companies[^h7218], and laid wait[^h693] in the field[^h7704], and looked[^h7200], and, behold, the people[^h5971] were come forth[^h3318] out of the city[^h5892]; and he rose up[^h6965] against them, and smote[^h5221] them.
###### 44
And Abimelech[^h40], and the company[^h7218] that was with him, rushed forward[^h6584], and stood[^h5975] in the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892]: and the two[^h8147] other companies[^h7218] ran upon[^h6584] all the people that were in the fields[^h7704], and slew[^h5221] them.
###### 45
And Abimelech[^h40] fought[^h3898] against the city[^h5892] all that day[^h3117]; and he took[^h3920] the city[^h5892], and slew[^h2026] the people[^h5971] that was therein, and beat down[^h5422] the city[^h5892], and sowed[^h2232] it with salt[^h4417].
###### 46
And when all the men[^h1167] of the tower[^h4026] of Shechem[^h7927] heard[^h8085] that, they entered[^h935] into an hold[^h6877] of the house[^h1004] of the god[^h410] Berith[^h1286].
###### 47
And it was told[^h5046] Abimelech[^h40], that all the men[^h1167] of the tower[^h4026] of Shechem[^h7927] were gathered together[^h6908].
###### 48
And Abimelech[^h40] gat him up[^h5927] to mount[^h2022] Zalmon[^h6756], he and all the people[^h5971] that were with him; and Abimelech[^h40] took[^h3947] an axe[^h7134] in his hand[^h3027], and cut down[^h3772] a bough[^h7754] from the trees[^h6086], and took[^h5375] it, and laid[^h7760] it on his shoulder[^h7926], and said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971] that were with him, What ye have seen[^h7200] me do[^h6213], make haste[^h4116], and do[^h6213] as I[^h3644] have done. 
###### 49
And all the people[^h5971] likewise cut down[^h3772] every man[^h376] his bough[^h7754], and followed[^h3212] [^h310] Abimelech[^h40], and put[^h7760] them to the hold[^h6877], and set[^h3341] the hold[^h6877] on fire[^h784] upon them; so that all the men[^h582] of the tower[^h4026] of Shechem[^h7927] died[^h4191] also, about a thousand[^h505] men[^h376] and women[^h802].
###### 50
Then went[^h3212] Abimelech[^h40] to Thebez[^h8405], and encamped[^h2583] against Thebez[^h8405], and took[^h3920] it.
###### 51
But there was a strong[^h5797] tower[^h4026] within[^h8432] the city[^h5892], and thither fled[^h5127] all the men[^h582] and women[^h802], and all they[^h1167] of the city[^h5892], and shut[^h5462] it to them, and gat them up[^h5927] to the top[^h1406] of the tower[^h4026].
###### 52
And Abimelech[^h40] came[^h935] unto the tower[^h4026], and fought[^h3898] against it, and went hard[^h5066] unto the door[^h6607] of the tower[^h4026] to burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784].
###### 53
And a certain[^h259] woman[^h802] cast[^h7993] a piece[^h6400] of a millstone[^h7393] upon Abimelech's[^h40] head[^h7218], and all to brake[^h7533] his skull[^h1538].
###### 54
Then he called[^h7121] hastily[^h4120] unto the young man[^h5288] his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], and said[^h559] unto him, Draw[^h8025] thy sword[^h2719], and slay[^h4191] me, that men say[^h559] not of me, A woman[^h802] slew[^h2026] him. And his young man[^h5288] thrust him through[^h1856], and he died[^h4191].
###### 55
And when the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that Abimelech[^h40] was dead[^h4191], they departed[^h3212] every man[^h376] unto his place[^h4725].
###### 56
Thus God[^h430] rendered[^h7725] the wickedness[^h7451] of Abimelech[^h40], which he did[^h6213] unto his father[^h1], in slaying[^h2026] his seventy[^h7657] brethren[^h251]:
###### 57
And all the evil[^h7451] of the men[^h582] of Shechem[^h7927] did God[^h430] render[^h7725] upon their heads[^h7218]: and upon them came[^h935] the curse[^h7045] of Jotham[^h3147] the son[^h1121] of Jerubbaal[^h3378].

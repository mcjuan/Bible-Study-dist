###### 1
Then Jerubbaal[^h3378], who is Gideon[^h1439], and all the people[^h5971] that were with him, rose up early[^h7925], and pitched[^h2583] beside the well of Harod[^h5878]: so that the host[^h4264] of the Midianites[^h4080] were on the north side[^h6828] of them, by the hill[^h1389] of Moreh[^h4176], in the valley[^h6010].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Gideon[^h1439], The people[^h5971] that are with thee are too many[^h7227] for me to give[^h5414] the Midianites[^h4080] into their hands[^h3027], lest Israel[^h3478] vaunt[^h6286] themselves against me, saying[^h559], Mine own hand[^h3027] hath saved[^h3467] me.
###### 3
Now therefore go to[^h4994], proclaim[^h7121] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Whosoever is fearful[^h3373] and afraid[^h2730], let him return[^h7725] and depart early[^h6852] from mount[^h2022] Gilead[^h1568]. And there returned[^h7725] of the people[^h5971] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] thousand[^h505]; and there remained[^h7604] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505].
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Gideon[^h1439], The people[^h5971] are yet too many[^h7227]; bring them down[^h3381] unto the water[^h4325], and I will try[^h6884] them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say[^h559] unto thee, This shall go[^h3212] with thee, the same shall go[^h3212] with thee; and of whomsoever I say[^h559] unto thee, This shall not go[^h3212] with thee, the same shall not go[^h3212].
###### 5
So he brought down[^h3381] the people[^h5971] unto the water[^h4325]: and the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Gideon[^h1439], Every one that lappeth[^h3952] of the water[^h4325] with his tongue[^h3956], as a dog[^h3611] lappeth[^h3952], him shalt thou set[^h3322] by himself; likewise every one that boweth down[^h3766] upon his knees[^h1290] to drink[^h8354].
###### 6
And the number[^h4557] of them that lapped[^h3952], putting their hand[^h3027] to their mouth[^h6310], were three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]: but all the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] bowed down[^h3766] upon their knees[^h1290] to drink[^h8354] water[^h4325].
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Gideon[^h1439], By the three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that lapped[^h3952] will I save[^h3467] you, and deliver[^h5414] the Midianites[^h4080] into thine hand[^h3027]: and let all the other people[^h5971] go[^h3212] every man[^h376] unto his place[^h4725].
###### 8
So the people[^h5971] took[^h3947] victuals[^h6720] in their hand[^h3027], and their trumpets[^h7782]: and he sent[^h7971] all[^h376] the rest of Israel[^h3478] every man[^h376] unto his tent[^h168], and retained[^h2388] those three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]: and the host[^h4264] of Midian[^h4080] was beneath him in the valley[^h6010].
###### 9
And it came to pass the same night[^h3915], that the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Arise[^h6965], get thee down[^h3381] unto the host[^h4264]; for I have delivered[^h5414] it into thine hand[^h3027].
###### 10
But if thou fear[^h3373] to go down[^h3381], go[^h3381] thou with Phurah[^h6513] thy servant[^h5288] down[^h3381] to the host[^h4264]:
###### 11
And thou shalt hear[^h8085] what they say[^h1696]; and afterward[^h310] shall thine hands[^h3027] be strengthened[^h2388] to go down[^h3381] unto the host[^h4264]. Then went he down[^h3381] with Phurah[^h6513] his servant[^h5288] unto the outside[^h7097] of the armed men[^h2571] that were in the host[^h4264]. 
###### 12
And the Midianites[^h4080] and the Amalekites[^h6002] and all the children[^h1121] of the east[^h6924] lay[^h5307] along in the valley[^h6010] like grasshoppers[^h697] for multitude[^h7230]; and their camels[^h1581] were without number[^h4557], as the sand[^h2344] by the sea[^h3220] side[^h8193] for multitude[^h7230].
###### 13
And when Gideon[^h1439] was come[^h935], behold, there was a man[^h376] that told[^h5608] a dream[^h2472] unto his fellow[^h7453], and said[^h559], Behold, I dreamed[^h2492] a dream[^h2472], and, lo, a cake[^h6742] [^h6742] of barley[^h8184] bread[^h3899] tumbled[^h2015] into the host[^h4264] of Midian[^h4080], and came[^h935] unto a tent[^h168], and smote[^h5221] it that it fell[^h5307], and overturned[^h2015] [^h4605] it, that the tent[^h168] lay along[^h5307].
###### 14
And his fellow[^h7453] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], This is nothing else save the sword[^h2719] of Gideon[^h1439] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101], a man[^h376] of Israel[^h3478]: for into his hand[^h3027] hath God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] Midian[^h4080], and all the host[^h4264].
###### 15
And it was so, when Gideon[^h1439] heard[^h8085] the telling[^h4557] of the dream[^h2472], and the interpretation[^h7667] thereof, that he worshipped[^h7812], and returned[^h7725] into the host[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559], Arise[^h6965]; for the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] into your hand[^h3027] the host[^h4264] of Midian[^h4080]. 
###### 16
And he divided[^h2673] the three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] into three[^h7969] companies[^h7218], and he put[^h5414] a trumpet[^h7782] in every man's hand[^h3027], with empty[^h7386] pitchers[^h3537], and lamps[^h3940] within[^h8432] the pitchers[^h3537].  
###### 17
And he said[^h559] unto them, Look[^h7200] on me, and do[^h6213] likewise: and, behold, when I come[^h935] to the outside[^h7097] of the camp[^h4264], it shall be that, as I do[^h6213], so shall ye do[^h6213].
###### 18
When I blow[^h8628] with a trumpet[^h7782], I and all that are with me, then blow[^h8628] ye the trumpets[^h7782] also on every side[^h5439] of all the camp[^h4264], and say[^h559], The sword of the LORD[^h3068], and of Gideon[^h1439].
###### 19
So Gideon[^h1439], and the hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that were with him, came[^h935] unto the outside[^h7097] of the camp[^h4264] in the beginning[^h7218] of the middle[^h8484] watch[^h821]; and they had but[^h389] newly[^h6965] set[^h6965] the watch[^h8104]: and they blew[^h8628] the trumpets[^h7782], and brake[^h5310] the pitchers[^h3537] that were in their hands[^h3027].
###### 20
And the three[^h7969] companies[^h7218] blew[^h8628] the trumpets[^h7782], and brake[^h7665] the pitchers[^h3537], and held[^h2388] the lamps[^h3940] in their left[^h8040] hands[^h3027], and the trumpets[^h7782] in their right[^h3225] hands[^h3027] to blow[^h8628] withal: and they cried[^h7121], The sword[^h2719] of the LORD[^h3068], and of Gideon[^h1439].
###### 21
And they stood[^h5975] every man[^h376] in his place round about[^h5439] the camp[^h4264]: and all the host[^h4264] ran[^h7323], and cried[^h7321], and fled[^h5127] [^h5127].
###### 22
And the three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] blew[^h8628] the trumpets[^h7782], and the LORD[^h3068] set[^h7760] every man's[^h376] sword[^h2719] against his fellow[^h7453], even throughout all the host[^h4264]: and the host[^h4264] fled[^h5127] to Bethshittah[^h1029] in Zererath[^h6888], and to the border[^h8193] of Abelmeholah[^h65], unto Tabbath[^h2888].  
###### 23
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] gathered themselves together[^h6817] out of Naphtali[^h5321], and out of Asher[^h836], and out of all Manasseh[^h4519], and pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] the Midianites[^h4080].
###### 24
And Gideon[^h1439] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] throughout all mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], saying[^h559], Come down[^h3381] against[^h7125] the Midianites[^h4080], and take[^h3920] before them the waters[^h4325] unto Bethbarah[^h1012] and Jordan[^h3383]. Then all the men[^h376] of Ephraim[^h669] gathered themselves together[^h6817], and took[^h3920] the waters[^h4325] unto Bethbarah[^h1012] and Jordan[^h3383].
###### 25
And they took[^h3920] two[^h8147] princes[^h8269] of the Midianites[^h4080], Oreb[^h6159] and Zeeb[^h2062]; and they slew[^h2026] Oreb[^h6159] upon the rock[^h6697] Oreb[^h6159], and Zeeb[^h2062] they slew[^h2026] at the winepress[^h3342] of Zeeb[^h2062], and pursued[^h7291] Midian[^h4080], and brought[^h935] the heads[^h7218] of Oreb[^h6159] and Zeeb[^h2062] to Gideon[^h1439] on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383].

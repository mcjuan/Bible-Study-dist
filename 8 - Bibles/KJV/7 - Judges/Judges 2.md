###### 1
And an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] came up[^h5927] from Gilgal[^h1537] to Bochim[^h1066], and said[^h559], I made you to go up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], and have brought[^h935] you unto the land[^h776] which I sware[^h7650] unto your fathers[^h1]; and I said[^h559], I will never[^h5769] break[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285] with you. 
###### 2
And ye shall make[^h3772] no league[^h1285] with the inhabitants[^h3427] of this land[^h776]; ye shall throw down[^h5422] their altars[^h4196]: but ye have not obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963]: why have ye done[^h6213] this?
###### 3
Wherefore I also said[^h559], I will not drive them out[^h1644] from before[^h6440] you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides[^h6654], and their gods[^h430] shall be a snare[^h4170] unto you.
###### 4
And it came to pass, when the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] these words[^h1697] unto all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], that the people[^h5971] lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 5
And they called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of that place[^h4725] Bochim[^h1066]: and they sacrificed[^h2076] there unto the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 6
And when Joshua[^h3091] had let the people[^h5971] go[^h7971], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h3212] every man[^h376] unto his inheritance[^h5159] to possess[^h3423] the land[^h776].
###### 7
And the people[^h5971] served[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] all the days[^h3117] of Joshua[^h3091], and all the days[^h3117] of the elders[^h2205] that outlived[^h748] [^h3117] [^h310] Joshua[^h3091], who had seen[^h7200] all the great[^h1419] works[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068], that he did[^h6213] for Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 8
And Joshua[^h3091] the son[^h1121] of Nun[^h5126], the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], died[^h4191], being an hundred[^h3967] and ten[^h6235] years[^h8141] old[^h1121].
###### 9
And they buried[^h6912] him in the border[^h1366] of his inheritance[^h5159] in Timnathheres[^h8556], in the mount[^h2022] of Ephraim[^h669], on the north side[^h6828] of the hill[^h2022] Gaash[^h1608].
###### 10
And also all that generation[^h1755] were gathered[^h622] unto their fathers[^h1]: and there arose[^h6965] another[^h312] generation[^h1755] after[^h310] them, which knew[^h3045] not the LORD[^h3068], nor yet the works[^h4639] which he had done[^h6213] for Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] Baalim[^h1168]:
###### 12
And they forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of their fathers[^h1], which brought them out[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and followed[^h3212] [^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430], of the gods[^h430] of the people[^h5971] that were round about[^h5439] them, and bowed[^h7812] themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD[^h3068] to anger[^h3707].
###### 13
And they forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] Baal[^h1168] and Ashtaroth[^h6252].
###### 14
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was hot[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478], and he delivered[^h5414] them into the hands[^h3027] of spoilers[^h8154] that spoiled[^h8155] them, and he sold[^h4376] them into the hands[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341] round about[^h5439], so that they could[^h3201] not any longer[^h5750] stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341].
###### 15
Whithersoever they went out[^h3318], the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was against them for evil[^h7451], as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696], and as the LORD[^h3068] had sworn[^h7650] unto them: and they were greatly[^h3966] distressed[^h3334].
###### 16
Nevertheless the LORD[^h3068] raised up[^h6965] judges[^h8199], which delivered[^h3467] them out of the hand[^h3027] of those that spoiled[^h8154] them. 
###### 17
And yet they would not hearken[^h8085] unto their judges[^h8199], but they went a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and bowed[^h7812] themselves unto them: they turned[^h5493] quickly[^h4118] out of the way[^h1870] which their fathers[^h1] walked in[^h1980], obeying[^h8085] the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068]; but they did[^h6213] not so.
###### 18
And when the LORD[^h3068] raised[^h6965] them up judges[^h8199], then the LORD[^h3068] was with the judge[^h8199], and delivered[^h3467] them out of the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341] all the days[^h3117] of the judge[^h8199]: for it repented[^h5162] the LORD[^h3068] because[^h6440] of their groanings[^h5009] by reason of them that oppressed[^h3905] them and vexed[^h1766] them.
###### 19
And it came to pass, when the judge[^h8199] was dead[^h4194], that they returned[^h7725], and corrupted[^h7843] themselves more than their fathers[^h1], in following[^h3212] [^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430] to serve[^h5647] them, and to bow down[^h7812] unto them; they ceased[^h5307] not from their own doings[^h4611], nor from their stubborn[^h7186] way[^h1870].  
###### 20
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was hot[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478]; and he said[^h559], Because that this people[^h1471] hath transgressed[^h5674] my covenant[^h1285] which I commanded[^h6680] their fathers[^h1], and have not hearkened[^h8085] unto my voice[^h6963];
###### 21
I also will not henceforth[^h3254] drive out[^h3423] any[^h376] from before[^h6440] them of the nations[^h1471] which Joshua[^h3091] left[^h5800] when he died[^h4191]:
###### 22
That through them I may prove[^h5254] Israel[^h3478], whether they will keep[^h8104] the way[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068] to walk[^h3212] therein, as their fathers[^h1] did keep[^h8104] it, or not.
###### 23
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] left[^h3240] those nations[^h1471], without[^h1115] driving them out[^h3423] hastily[^h4118]; neither delivered[^h5414] he them into the hand[^h3027] of Joshua[^h3091].

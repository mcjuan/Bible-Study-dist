###### 1
And the men[^h376] of Ephraim[^h669] said[^h559] unto him, Why hast thou[^h4100] served[^h6213] us thus[^h1697], that thou calledst[^h7121] us not, when thou wentest[^h1980] to fight[^h3898] with the Midianites[^h4080]? And they did chide[^h7378] with him sharply[^h2394].  
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto them, What have I done[^h6213] now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning[^h5955] of the grapes of Ephraim[^h669] better[^h2896] than the vintage[^h1210] of Abiezer[^h44]?
###### 3
God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] into your hands[^h3027] the princes[^h8269] of Midian[^h4080], Oreb[^h6159] and Zeeb[^h2062]: and what was I able[^h3201] to do[^h6213] in comparison of you? Then their anger[^h7307] was abated[^h7503] toward him, when he had said[^h1697] that[^h1696]. 
###### 4
And Gideon[^h1439] came[^h935] to Jordan[^h3383], and passed over[^h5674], he, and the three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that were with him, faint[^h5889], yet pursuing[^h7291] them.
###### 5
And he said[^h559] unto the men[^h582] of Succoth[^h5523], Give[^h5414], I pray you, loaves[^h3603] of bread[^h3899] unto the people[^h5971] that follow[^h7272] me; for they be faint[^h5889], and I am pursuing[^h7291] after[^h310] Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759], kings[^h4428] of Midian[^h4080].
###### 6
And the princes[^h8269] of Succoth[^h5523] said[^h559], Are the hands[^h3709] of Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] now in thine hand[^h3027], that we should give[^h5414] bread[^h3899] unto thine army[^h6635]?
###### 7
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559], Therefore when the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] into mine hand[^h3027], then I will tear[^h1758] your flesh[^h1320] with the thorns[^h6975] of the wilderness[^h4057] and with briers[^h1303]. 
###### 8
And he went up[^h5927] thence to Penuel[^h6439], and spake[^h1696] unto them likewise[^h2063]: and the men[^h582] of Penuel[^h6439] answered[^h6030] him as the men[^h582] of Succoth[^h5523] had answered[^h6030] him.
###### 9
And he spake[^h559] also unto the men[^h582] of Penuel[^h6439], saying[^h559], When I come again[^h7725] in peace[^h7965], I will break down[^h5422] this tower[^h4026].
###### 10
Now Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] were in Karkor[^h7174], and their hosts[^h4264] with them, about fifteen[^h2568] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] men, all that were left[^h3498] of all the hosts[^h4264] of the children[^h1121] of the east[^h6924]: for there fell[^h5307] an hundred[^h3967] and twenty[^h6242] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719]. 
###### 11
And Gideon[^h1439] went up[^h5927] by the way[^h1870] of them that dwelt[^h7931] in tents[^h168] on the east[^h6924] of Nobah[^h5025] and Jogbehah[^h3011], and smote[^h5221] the host[^h4264]: for the host[^h4264] was secure[^h983].
###### 12
And when Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] fled[^h5127], he pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] them, and took[^h3920] the two[^h8147] kings[^h4428] of Midian[^h4080], Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759], and discomfited[^h2729] all the host[^h4264]. 
###### 13
And Gideon[^h1439] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] returned[^h7725] from battle[^h4421] before[^h4608] the sun[^h2775] was up,
###### 14
And caught[^h3920] a young man[^h5288] of the men[^h582] of Succoth[^h5523], and enquired[^h7592] of him: and he described[^h3789] unto him the princes[^h8269] of Succoth[^h5523], and the elders[^h2205] thereof, even threescore and seventeen[^h7657] [^h7651] men[^h376]. 
###### 15
And he came[^h935] unto the men[^h582] of Succoth[^h5523], and said[^h559], Behold Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759], with whom ye did upbraid[^h2778] me, saying[^h559], Are the hands[^h3709] of Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] now in thine hand[^h3027], that we should give[^h5414] bread[^h3899] unto thy men[^h582] that are weary[^h3287]?
###### 16
And he took[^h3947] the elders[^h2205] of the city[^h5892], and thorns[^h6975] of the wilderness[^h4057] and briers[^h1303], and with them he taught[^h3045] the men[^h582] of Succoth[^h5523]. 
###### 17
And he beat down[^h5422] the tower[^h4026] of Penuel[^h6439], and slew[^h2026] the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892].
###### 18
Then said[^h559] he unto Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759], What[^h375] manner of men[^h582] were they whom ye slew[^h2026] at Tabor[^h8396]? And they answered[^h559], As thou[^h3644] art, so were they; each one[^h259] resembled[^h8389] the children[^h1121] of a king[^h4428]. 
###### 19
And he said[^h559], They were my brethren[^h251], even the sons[^h1121] of my mother[^h517]: as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], if[^h3863] ye had saved them alive[^h2421], I would not slay[^h2026] you.
###### 20
And he said[^h559] unto Jether[^h3500] his firstborn[^h1060], Up[^h6965], and slay[^h2026] them. But the youth[^h5288] drew[^h8025] not his sword[^h2719]: for he feared[^h3372], because he was yet a youth[^h5288].
###### 21
Then Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759] said[^h559], Rise[^h6965] thou, and fall[^h6293] upon us: for as the man[^h376] is, so is his strength[^h1369]. And Gideon[^h1439] arose[^h6965], and slew[^h2026] Zebah[^h2078] and Zalmunna[^h6759], and took away[^h3947] the ornaments[^h7720] that were on their camels'[^h1581] necks[^h6677]. 
###### 22
Then the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto Gideon[^h1439], Rule[^h4910] thou over us, both thou, and thy son[^h1121], and thy son's[^h1121] son[^h1121] also: for thou hast delivered[^h3467] us from the hand[^h3027] of Midian[^h4080].
###### 23
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559] unto them, I will not rule[^h4910] over you, neither shall my son[^h1121] rule[^h4910] over you: the LORD[^h3068] shall rule[^h4910] over you.
###### 24
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559] unto them, I would desire[^h7592] a request[^h7596] of you, that ye would give[^h5414] me every man[^h376] the earrings[^h5141] of his prey[^h7998]. (For they had golden[^h2091] earrings[^h5141], because they were Ishmaelites[^h3459].)
###### 25
And they answered[^h559], We will willingly[^h5414] give[^h5414] them. And they spread[^h6566] a garment[^h8071], and did cast[^h7993] therein every man[^h376] the earrings[^h5141] of his prey[^h7998].
###### 26
And the weight[^h4948] of the golden[^h2091] earrings[^h5141] that he requested[^h7592] was a thousand[^h505] and seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] shekels of gold[^h2091]; beside ornaments[^h7720], and collars[^h5188], and purple[^h713] raiment[^h899] that was on the kings[^h4428] of Midian[^h4080], and beside the chains[^h6060] that were about their camels'[^h1581] necks[^h6677]. 
###### 27
And Gideon[^h1439] made[^h6213] an ephod[^h646] thereof, and put[^h3322] it in his city[^h5892], even in Ophrah[^h6084]: and all Israel[^h3478] went thither a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] it: which thing became a snare[^h4170] unto Gideon[^h1439], and to his house[^h1004].
###### 28
Thus was Midian[^h4080] subdued[^h3665] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], so that they lifted up[^h5375] their heads[^h7218] no more[^h3254]. And the country[^h776] was in quietness[^h8252] forty[^h705] years[^h8141] in the days[^h3117] of Gideon[^h1439].
###### 29
And Jerubbaal[^h3378] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] went[^h3212] and dwelt[^h3427] in his own house[^h1004].
###### 30
And Gideon[^h1439] had threescore and ten[^h7657] sons[^h1121] of his body[^h3409] begotten[^h3318]: for he had many[^h7227] wives[^h802]. 
###### 31
And his concubine[^h6370] that was in Shechem[^h7927], she also bare[^h3205] him a son[^h1121], whose name[^h8034] he called[^h7760] Abimelech[^h40]. 
###### 32
And Gideon[^h1439] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] died[^h4191] in a good[^h2896] old age[^h7872], and was buried[^h6912] in the sepulchre[^h6913] of Joash[^h3101] his father[^h1], in Ophrah[^h6084] of the Abiezrites[^h33].
###### 33
And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon[^h1439] was dead[^h4191], that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] turned again[^h7725], and went a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] Baalim[^h1168], and made[^h7760] Baalberith[^h1170] their god[^h430].
###### 34
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] remembered[^h2142] not the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], who had delivered[^h5337] them out of the hands[^h3027] of all their enemies[^h341] on every side[^h5439]:
###### 35
Neither shewed[^h6213] they kindness[^h2617] to the house[^h1004] of Jerubbaal[^h3378], namely, Gideon[^h1439], according to all the goodness[^h2896] which he had shewed[^h6213] unto Israel[^h3478].

Then sang[^h7891] Deborah[^h1683] and Barak[^h1301] the son[^h1121] of Abinoam[^h42] on that day[^h3117], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Praise[^h1288] ye the LORD[^h3068] for the avenging[^h6544] [^h6546] of Israel[^h3478], when the people[^h5971] willingly offered[^h5068] themselves.
###### 3
Hear[^h8085], O ye kings[^h4428]; give ear[^h238], O ye princes[^h7336]; I, even I, will sing[^h7891] unto the LORD[^h3068]; I will sing[^h2167] praise to the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
LORD[^h3068], when thou wentest out[^h3318] of Seir[^h8165], when thou marchedst out[^h6805] of the field[^h7704] of Edom[^h123], the earth[^h776] trembled[^h7493], and the heavens[^h8064] dropped[^h5197], the clouds[^h5645] also dropped[^h5197] water[^h4325].
###### 5
The mountains[^h2022] melted[^h5140] from before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], even that Sinai[^h5514] from before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 6
In the days[^h3117] of Shamgar[^h8044] the son[^h1121] of Anath[^h6067], in the days[^h3117] of Jael[^h3278], the highways[^h734] were unoccupied[^h2308], and the travellers[^h1980] walked[^h3212] through byways[^h6128] [^h5410].  
###### 7
The inhabitants of the villages[^h6520] ceased[^h2308], they ceased[^h2308] in Israel[^h3478], until that I Deborah[^h1683] arose[^h6965], that I arose[^h6965] a mother[^h517] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
They chose[^h977] new[^h2319] gods[^h430]; then was war[^h3901] in the gates[^h8179]: was there a shield[^h4043] or spear[^h7420] seen[^h7200] among forty[^h705] thousand[^h505] in Israel[^h3478]?
###### 9
My heart[^h3820] is toward the governors[^h2710] of Israel[^h3478], that offered themselves willingly[^h5068] among the people[^h5971]. Bless[^h1288] ye the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
Speak[^h7878], ye that ride[^h7392] on white[^h6715] asses[^h860], ye that sit[^h3427] in judgment[^h4055], and walk[^h1980] by the way[^h1870]. 
###### 11
They that are delivered from the noise[^h6963] of archers[^h2686] in the places of drawing water[^h4857], there shall they rehearse[^h8567] the righteous acts[^h6666] of the LORD[^h3068], even the righteous acts[^h6666] toward the inhabitants of his villages[^h6520] in Israel[^h3478]: then shall the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068] go down[^h3381] to the gates[^h8179]. 
###### 12
Awake[^h5782], awake[^h5782], Deborah[^h1683]: awake[^h5782], awake[^h5782], utter[^h1696] a song[^h7892]: arise[^h6965], Barak[^h1301], and lead thy captivity[^h7628] captive[^h7617], thou son[^h1121] of Abinoam[^h42].
###### 13
Then he made him that remaineth[^h8300] have dominion[^h7287] over the nobles[^h117] among the people[^h5971]: the LORD[^h3068] made me have dominion[^h7287] over the mighty[^h1368].
###### 14
Out of Ephraim[^h669] was there a root[^h8328] of them against Amalek[^h6002]; after[^h310] thee, Benjamin[^h1144], among thy people[^h5971]; out of Machir[^h4353] came down[^h3381] governors[^h2710], and out of Zebulun[^h2074] they that handle[^h4900] the pen[^h7626] of the writer[^h5608]. 
###### 15
And the princes[^h8269] of Issachar[^h3485] were with Deborah[^h1683]; even Issachar[^h3485], and also Barak[^h1301]: he was sent[^h7971] on foot[^h7272] into the valley[^h6010]. For the divisions[^h6390] of Reuben[^h7205] there were great[^h1419] thoughts[^h2711] of heart[^h3820].   
###### 16
Why abodest[^h3427] thou among[^h996] the sheepfolds[^h4942], to hear[^h8085] the bleatings[^h8292] of the flocks[^h5739]? For the divisions[^h6390] of Reuben[^h7205] there were great[^h1419] searchings[^h2714] of heart[^h3820]. 
###### 17
Gilead[^h1568] abode[^h7931] beyond[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383]: and why did Dan[^h1835] remain[^h1481] in ships[^h591]? Asher[^h836] continued[^h3427] on the sea[^h3220] shore[^h2348], and abode[^h7931] in his breaches[^h4664].  
###### 18
Zebulun[^h2074] and Naphtali[^h5321] were a people[^h5971] that jeoparded[^h2778] their lives[^h5315] unto the death[^h4191] in the high places[^h4791] of the field[^h7704]. 
###### 19
The kings[^h4428] came[^h935] and fought[^h3898], then fought[^h3898] the kings[^h4428] of Canaan[^h3667] in Taanach[^h8590] by the waters[^h4325] of Megiddo[^h4023]; they took[^h3947] no gain[^h1215] of money[^h3701].
###### 20
They fought[^h3898] from heaven[^h8064]; the stars[^h3556] in their courses[^h4546] fought[^h3898] against Sisera[^h5516]. 
###### 21
The river[^h5158] of Kishon[^h7028] swept them away[^h1640], that ancient[^h6917] river[^h5158], the river[^h5158] Kishon[^h7028]. O my soul[^h5315], thou hast trodden down[^h1869] strength[^h5797].
###### 22
Then were the horsehoofs[^h6119] [^h5483] broken[^h1986] by the means of the pransings[^h1726], the pransings[^h1726] of their mighty ones[^h47]. 
###### 23
Curse[^h779] ye Meroz[^h4789], said[^h559] the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], curse[^h779] ye bitterly[^h779] the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof; because they came[^h935] not to the help[^h5833] of the LORD[^h3068], to the help[^h5833] of the LORD[^h3068] against the mighty[^h1368].
###### 24
Blessed[^h1288] above women[^h802] shall Jael[^h3278] the wife[^h802] of Heber[^h2268] the Kenite[^h7017] be, blessed[^h1288] shall she be above women[^h802] in the tent[^h168].
###### 25
He asked[^h7592] water[^h4325], and she gave[^h5414] him milk[^h2461]; she brought forth[^h7126] butter[^h2529] in a lordly[^h117] dish[^h5602].
###### 26
She put[^h7971] her hand[^h3027] to the nail[^h3489], and her right hand[^h3225] to the workmen's[^h6001] hammer[^h1989]; and with the hammer she smote[^h1986] Sisera[^h5516], she smote off[^h4277] his head[^h7218], when she had pierced[^h4272] and stricken through[^h2498] his temples[^h7541]. 
###### 27
At her feet[^h7272] he bowed[^h3766], he fell[^h5307], he lay down[^h7901]: at her feet[^h7272] he bowed[^h3766], he fell[^h5307]: where[^h834] he bowed[^h3766], there he fell down[^h5307] dead[^h7703].  
###### 28
The mother[^h517] of Sisera[^h5516] looked[^h8259] out at a window[^h2474], and cried[^h2980] through the lattice[^h822], Why is his chariot[^h7393] so long[^h954] in coming[^h935]? why tarry[^h309] the wheels[^h6471] of his chariots[^h4818]?
###### 29
Her wise[^h2450] ladies[^h8282] answered[^h6030] her, yea, she returned[^h7725] answer[^h561] to herself, 
###### 30
Have they not sped[^h4672]? have they not divided[^h2505] the prey[^h7998]; to every[^h7218] man[^h1397] a damsel[^h7356] or two[^h7361]; to Sisera[^h5516] a prey[^h7998] of divers colours[^h6648], a prey[^h7998] of divers colours[^h6648] of needlework[^h7553], of divers colours[^h6648] of needlework on both sides[^h7553], meet for the necks[^h6677] of them that take the spoil[^h7998]? 
###### 31
So let all thine enemies[^h341] perish[^h6], O LORD[^h3068]: but let them that love[^h157] him be as the sun[^h8121] when he goeth forth[^h3318] in his might[^h1369]. And the land[^h776] had rest[^h8252] forty[^h705] years[^h8141].

###### 1
Now after[^h310] the death[^h4194] of Joshua[^h3091] it came to pass, that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] asked[^h7592] the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Who shall go up[^h5927] for us against the Canaanites[^h3669] first[^h8462], to fight[^h3898] against them?
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Judah[^h3063] shall go up[^h5927]: behold, I have delivered[^h5414] the land[^h776] into his hand[^h3027].
###### 3
And Judah[^h3063] said[^h559] unto Simeon[^h8095] his brother[^h251], Come up[^h5927] with me into my lot[^h1486], that we may fight[^h3898] against the Canaanites[^h3669]; and I likewise will go[^h1980] with thee into thy lot[^h1486]. So Simeon[^h8095] went[^h3212] with him.
###### 4
And Judah[^h3063] went up[^h5927]; and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] the Canaanites[^h3669] and the Perizzites[^h6522] into their hand[^h3027]: and they slew[^h5221] of them in Bezek[^h966] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] men[^h376].
###### 5
And they found[^h4672] Adonibezek[^h137] in Bezek[^h966]: and they fought[^h3898] against him, and they slew[^h5221] the Canaanites[^h3669] and the Perizzites[^h6522].
###### 6
But Adonibezek[^h137] fled[^h5127]; and they pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] him, and caught[^h270] him, and cut off[^h7112] his thumbs[^h931] [^h3027] and his great toes[^h7272].
###### 7
And Adonibezek[^h137] said[^h559], Threescore and ten[^h7657] kings[^h4428], having their thumbs[^h931] [^h3027] and their great toes[^h7272] cut off[^h7112], gathered[^h3950] their meat under my table[^h7979]: as I have done[^h6213], so God[^h430] hath requited[^h7999] me. And they brought[^h935] him to Jerusalem[^h3389], and there he died[^h4191].  
###### 8
Now the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] had fought[^h3898] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and had taken[^h3920] it, and smitten[^h5221] it with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and set[^h7971] the city[^h5892] on fire[^h784].
###### 9
And afterward[^h310] the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] went down[^h3381] to fight[^h3898] against the Canaanites[^h3669], that dwelt[^h3427] in the mountain[^h2022], and in the south[^h5045], and in the valley[^h8219]. 
###### 10
And Judah[^h3063] went[^h3212] against the Canaanites[^h3669] that dwelt[^h3427] in Hebron[^h2275]: (now the name[^h8034] of Hebron[^h2275] before[^h6440] was Kirjatharba[^h7153]:) and they slew[^h5221] Sheshai[^h8344], and Ahiman[^h289], and Talmai[^h8526].
###### 11
And from thence he went[^h3212] against the inhabitants[^h3427] of Debir[^h1688]: and the name[^h8034] of Debir[^h1688] before[^h6440] was Kirjathsepher[^h7158]:
###### 12
And Caleb[^h3612] said[^h559], He that smiteth[^h5221] Kirjathsepher[^h7158], and taketh[^h3920] it, to him will I give[^h5414] Achsah[^h5915] my daughter[^h1323] to wife[^h802].
###### 13
And Othniel[^h6274] the son[^h1121] of Kenaz[^h7073], Caleb's[^h3612] younger[^h6996] brother[^h251], took[^h3920] it: and he gave[^h5414] him Achsah[^h5915] his daughter[^h1323] to wife[^h802].
###### 14
And it came to pass, when she came[^h935] to him, that she moved[^h5496] him to ask[^h7592] of her father[^h1] a field[^h7704]: and she lighted[^h6795] from off her ass[^h2543]; and Caleb[^h3612] said[^h559] unto her, What wilt thou?
###### 15
And she said[^h559] unto him, Give[^h3051] me a blessing[^h1293]: for thou hast given[^h5414] me a south[^h5045] land[^h776]; give[^h5414] me also springs[^h1543] of water[^h4325]. And Caleb[^h3612] gave[^h5414] her the upper[^h5942] springs[^h1543] and the nether[^h8482] springs[^h1543].
###### 16
And the children[^h1121] of the Kenite[^h7017], Moses'[^h4872] father in law[^h2859], went up[^h5927] out of the city[^h5892] of palm trees[^h8558] [^h5899] with the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] into the wilderness[^h4057] of Judah[^h3063], which lieth in the south[^h5045] of Arad[^h6166]; and they went[^h3212] and dwelt[^h3427] among[^h854] the people[^h5971].
###### 17
And Judah[^h3063] went[^h3212] with Simeon[^h8095] his brother[^h251], and they slew[^h5221] the Canaanites[^h3669] that inhabited[^h3427] Zephath[^h6857], and utterly destroyed[^h2763] it. And the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] was called[^h7121] Hormah[^h2767].
###### 18
Also Judah[^h3063] took[^h3920] Gaza[^h5804] with the coast[^h1366] thereof, and Askelon[^h831] with the coast[^h1366] thereof, and Ekron[^h6138] with the coast[^h1366] thereof.
###### 19
And the LORD[^h3068] was with Judah[^h3063]; and he drave out[^h3423] the inhabitants of the mountain[^h2022]; but could not[^h3808] drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants[^h3427] of the valley[^h6010], because they had chariots[^h7393] of iron[^h1270]. 
###### 20
And they gave[^h5414] Hebron[^h2275] unto Caleb[^h3612], as Moses[^h4872] said[^h1696]: and he expelled[^h3423] thence the three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] of Anak[^h6061].
###### 21
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] did not drive out[^h3423] the Jebusites[^h2983] that inhabited[^h3427] Jerusalem[^h3389]; but the Jebusites[^h2983] dwell[^h3427] with the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] in Jerusalem[^h3389] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 22
And the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130], they also went up[^h5927] against Bethel[^h1008]: and the LORD[^h3068] was with them.
###### 23
And the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130] sent to descry[^h8446] Bethel[^h1008]. (Now the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] before[^h6440] was Luz[^h3870].)
###### 24
And the spies[^h8104] saw[^h7200] a man[^h376] come forth[^h3318] out of the city[^h5892], and they said[^h559] unto him, Shew[^h7200] us, we pray thee, the entrance[^h3996] into the city[^h5892], and we will shew[^h6213] thee mercy[^h2617].
###### 25
And when he shewed[^h7200] them the entrance[^h3996] into the city[^h5892], they smote[^h5221] the city[^h5892] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; but they let go[^h7971] the man[^h376] and all his family[^h4940].
###### 26
And the man[^h376] went[^h3212] into the land[^h776] of the Hittites[^h2850], and built[^h1129] a city[^h5892], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] thereof Luz[^h3870]: which is the name[^h8034] thereof unto this day[^h3117].
###### 27
Neither did Manasseh[^h4519] drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants of Bethshean[^h1052] and her towns[^h1323], nor Taanach[^h8590] and her towns[^h1323], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Dor[^h1756] and her towns[^h1323], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Ibleam[^h2991] and her towns[^h1323], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Megiddo[^h4023] and her towns[^h1323]: but the Canaanites[^h3669] would[^h2974] dwell[^h3427] in that land[^h776].
###### 28
And it came to pass, when Israel[^h3478] was strong[^h2388], that they put[^h7760] the Canaanites[^h3669] to tribute[^h4522], and did not utterly[^h3423] drive them out[^h3423].
###### 29
Neither did Ephraim[^h669] drive out[^h3423] the Canaanites[^h3669] that dwelt[^h3427] in Gezer[^h1507]; but the Canaanites[^h3669] dwelt[^h3427] in Gezer[^h1507] among[^h7130] them.
###### 30
Neither did Zebulun[^h2074] drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Kitron[^h7003], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Nahalol[^h5096]; but the Canaanites[^h3669] dwelt[^h3427] among[^h7130] them, and became tributaries[^h4522].
###### 31
Neither did Asher[^h836] drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Accho[^h5910], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Zidon[^h6721], nor of Ahlab[^h303], nor of Achzib[^h392], nor of Helbah[^h2462], nor of Aphik[^h663], nor of Rehob[^h7340]:
###### 32
But the Asherites[^h843] dwelt[^h3427] among[^h7130] the Canaanites[^h3669], the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776]: for they did not drive them out[^h3423].
###### 33
Neither did Naphtali[^h5321] drive out[^h3423] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Bethshemesh[^h1053], nor the inhabitants[^h3427] of Bethanath[^h1043]; but he dwelt[^h3427] among[^h7130] the Canaanites[^h3669], the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776]: nevertheless the inhabitants[^h3427] of Bethshemesh[^h1053] and of Bethanath[^h1043] became tributaries[^h4522] unto them.
###### 34
And the Amorites[^h567] forced[^h3905] the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835] into the mountain[^h2022]: for they would not suffer[^h5414] them to come down[^h3381] to the valley[^h6010]:
###### 35
But the Amorites[^h567] would[^h2974] dwell[^h3427] in mount[^h2022] Heres[^h2776] in Aijalon[^h357], and in Shaalbim[^h8169]: yet the hand[^h3027] of the house[^h1004] of Joseph[^h3130] prevailed[^h3513], so that they became tributaries[^h4522]. 
###### 36
And the coast[^h1366] of the Amorites[^h567] was from the going up[^h4608] to Akrabbim[^h4610], from the rock[^h5553], and upward[^h4605].

###### 1
Now Jephthah[^h3316] the Gileadite[^h1569] was a mighty man[^h1368] of valour[^h2428], and he was the son[^h1121] of an harlot[^h802] [^h2181]: and Gilead[^h1568] begat[^h3205] Jephthah[^h3316].  
###### 2
And Gilead's[^h1568] wife[^h802] bare[^h3205] him sons[^h1121]; and his wife's[^h802] sons[^h1121] grew up[^h1431], and they thrust out[^h1644] Jephthah[^h3316], and said[^h559] unto him, Thou shalt not inherit[^h5157] in our father's[^h1] house[^h1004]; for thou art the son[^h1121] of a strange[^h312] woman[^h802].
###### 3
Then Jephthah[^h3316] fled[^h1272] from[^h6440] his brethren[^h251], and dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Tob[^h2897]: and there were gathered[^h3950] vain[^h7386] men[^h582] to Jephthah[^h3316], and went out[^h3318] with him. 
###### 4
And it came to pass in process of time[^h3117], that the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] made war[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 5
And it was so, that when the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] made war[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478], the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568] went[^h3212] to fetch[^h3947] Jephthah[^h3316] out of the land[^h776] of Tob[^h2897]:
###### 6
And they said[^h559] unto Jephthah[^h3316], Come[^h3212], and be our captain[^h7101], that we may fight[^h3898] with the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 7
And Jephthah[^h3316] said[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568], Did not ye hate[^h8130] me, and expel[^h1644] me out of my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]? and why are ye come[^h935] unto me now when ye are in distress[^h6887]?
###### 8
And the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568] said[^h559] unto Jephthah[^h3316], Therefore we turn again[^h7725] to thee now, that thou mayest go[^h1980] with us, and fight[^h3898] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and be our head[^h7218] over all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 9
And Jephthah[^h3316] said[^h559] unto the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568], If ye bring me home again[^h7725] to fight[^h3898] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and the LORD[^h3068] deliver[^h5414] them before[^h6440] me, shall I be your head[^h7218]?
###### 10
And the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568] said[^h559] unto Jephthah[^h3316], The LORD[^h3068] be witness[^h8085] between us, if we do[^h6213] not so according to thy words[^h1697]. 
###### 11
Then Jephthah[^h3316] went[^h3212] with the elders[^h2205] of Gilead[^h1568], and the people[^h5971] made[^h7760] him head[^h7218] and captain[^h7101] over them: and Jephthah[^h3316] uttered[^h1696] all his words[^h1697] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] in Mizpeh[^h4709].
###### 12
And Jephthah[^h3316] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], saying[^h559], What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come[^h935] against me to fight[^h3898] in my land[^h776]?
###### 13
And the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] answered[^h559] unto the messengers[^h4397] of Jephthah[^h3316], Because Israel[^h3478] took away[^h3947] my land[^h776], when they came up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714], from Arnon[^h769] even unto Jabbok[^h2999], and unto Jordan[^h3383]: now therefore restore those lands again[^h7725] peaceably[^h7965].
###### 14
And Jephthah[^h3316] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] again[^h3254] unto the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]:
###### 15
And said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] Jephthah[^h3316], Israel[^h3478] took not away[^h3947] the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], nor the land[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]:
###### 16
But when Israel[^h3478] came up[^h5927] from Egypt[^h4714], and walked[^h3212] through the wilderness[^h4057] unto the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220], and came[^h935] to Kadesh[^h6946];
###### 17
Then Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123], saying[^h559], Let me, I pray thee, pass through[^h5674] thy land[^h776]: but the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123] would not hearken[^h8085] thereto. And in like manner they sent[^h7971] unto the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124]: but he would[^h14] not consent: and Israel[^h3478] abode[^h3427] in Kadesh[^h6946].
###### 18
Then they went along[^h3212] through the wilderness[^h4057], and compassed[^h5437] the land[^h776] of Edom[^h123], and the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], and came[^h935] by the east side[^h4217] [^h8121] of the land[^h776] of Moab[^h4124], and pitched[^h2583] on the other side[^h5676] of Arnon[^h769], but came[^h935] not within the border[^h1366] of Moab[^h4124]: for Arnon[^h769] was the border[^h1366] of Moab[^h4124].
###### 19
And Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto Sihon[^h5511] king[^h4428] of the Amorites[^h567], the king[^h4428] of Heshbon[^h2809]; and Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto him, Let us pass[^h5674], we pray thee, through thy land[^h776] into[^h5704] my place[^h4725].
###### 20
But Sihon[^h5511] trusted[^h539] not Israel[^h3478] to pass[^h5674] through his coast[^h1366]: but Sihon[^h5511] gathered[^h622] all his people[^h5971] together[^h622], and pitched[^h2583] in Jahaz[^h3096], and fought[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478].
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] delivered[^h5414] Sihon[^h5511] and all his people[^h5971] into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478], and they smote[^h5221] them: so Israel[^h3478] possessed[^h3423] all the land[^h776] of the Amorites[^h567], the inhabitants[^h3427] of that country[^h776].
###### 22
And they possessed[^h3423] all the coasts[^h1366] of the Amorites[^h567], from Arnon[^h769] even unto Jabbok[^h2999], and from the wilderness[^h4057] even unto Jordan[^h3383].
###### 23
So now the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] hath dispossessed[^h3423] the Amorites[^h567] from before[^h6440] his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and shouldest thou possess[^h3423] it?
###### 24
Wilt not thou possess[^h3423] that which Chemosh[^h3645] thy god[^h430] giveth thee to possess[^h3423]? So whomsoever the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] shall drive out[^h3423] from before[^h6440] us, them will we possess[^h3423].
###### 25
And now art thou any thing better[^h2896] than Balak[^h1111] the son[^h1121] of Zippor[^h6834], king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124]? did he ever[^h7378] strive[^h7378] against Israel[^h3478], or did he ever[^h3898] fight[^h3898] against them,
###### 26
While Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in Heshbon[^h2809] and her towns[^h1323], and in Aroer[^h6177] and her towns[^h1323], and in all the cities[^h5892] that be along by the coasts[^h3027] of Arnon[^h769], three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] years[^h8141]? why therefore did ye not recover[^h5337] them within that time[^h6256]?
###### 27
Wherefore I have not sinned[^h2398] against thee, but thou doest[^h6213] [^h853] me wrong[^h7451] to war[^h3898] against me: the LORD[^h3068] the Judge[^h8199] be judge[^h8199] this day[^h3117] between the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 28
Howbeit the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] hearkened[^h8085] not unto the words[^h1697] of Jephthah[^h3316] which he sent[^h7971] him.
###### 29
Then the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came upon Jephthah[^h3316], and he passed over[^h5674] Gilead[^h1568], and Manasseh[^h4519], and passed over[^h5674] Mizpeh[^h4708] of Gilead[^h1568], and from Mizpeh[^h4708] of Gilead[^h1568] he passed over[^h5674] unto the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 30
And Jephthah[^h3316] vowed[^h5087] a vow[^h5088] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], If thou shalt without fail[^h5414] deliver[^h5414] the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] into mine hands[^h3027],
###### 31
Then it shall be, that whatsoever[^h3318] cometh forth[^h3318] of the doors[^h1817] of my house[^h1004] to meet[^h7125] me, when I return[^h7725] in peace[^h7965] from the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], shall surely be the LORD'S[^h3068], and I will offer it up[^h5927] for a burnt offering[^h5930].  
###### 32
So Jephthah[^h3316] passed over[^h5674] unto the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] to fight[^h3898] against them; and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] them into his hands[^h3027].
###### 33
And he smote[^h5221] them from Aroer[^h6177], even till thou come[^h935] to Minnith[^h4511], even twenty[^h6242] cities[^h5892], and unto the plain[^h58] of the vineyards[^h3754] [^h64], with a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]. Thus the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] were subdued[^h3665] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 34
And Jephthah[^h3316] came[^h935] to Mizpeh[^h4709] unto his house[^h1004], and, behold, his daughter[^h1323] came out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him with timbrels[^h8596] and with dances[^h4246]: and she was his only child[^h3173]; beside her he had neither son[^h1121] nor[^h176] daughter[^h1323]. 
###### 35
And it came to pass, when he saw[^h7200] her, that he rent[^h7167] his clothes[^h899], and said[^h559], Alas[^h162], my daughter[^h1323]! thou hast brought[^h3766] me very[^h3766] low[^h3766], and thou art one of them that trouble[^h5916] me: for I have opened[^h6475] my mouth[^h6310] unto the LORD[^h3068], and I cannot[^h3201] go back[^h7725].
###### 36
And she said[^h559] unto him, My father[^h1], if thou hast opened[^h6475] thy mouth[^h6310] unto the LORD[^h3068], do[^h6213] to me according to that which[^h834] hath proceeded[^h3318] out of thy mouth[^h6310]; forasmuch[^h310] as the LORD[^h3068] hath taken[^h6213] vengeance[^h5360] for thee of thine enemies[^h341], even of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 37
And she said[^h559] unto her father[^h1], Let this thing[^h1697] be done[^h6213] for me: let me alone[^h7503] two[^h8147] months[^h2320], that I may go up[^h3212] and down[^h3381] upon the mountains[^h2022], and bewail[^h1058] my virginity[^h1331], I and my fellows[^h7464] [^h7474]. 
###### 38
And he said[^h559], Go[^h3212]. And he sent her away[^h7971] for two[^h8147] months[^h2320]: and she went[^h3212] with her companions[^h7464], and bewailed[^h1058] her virginity[^h1331] upon the mountains[^h2022].
###### 39
And it came to pass at the end[^h7093] of two[^h8147] months[^h2320], that she returned[^h7725] unto her father[^h1], who did[^h6213] with her according to his vow[^h5088] which he had vowed[^h5087]: and she knew[^h3045] no man[^h376]. And it was a custom[^h2706] in Israel[^h3478], 
###### 40
That the daughters[^h1323] of Israel[^h3478] went[^h3212] yearly[^h3117] [^h3117] to lament[^h8567] the daughter[^h1323] of Jephthah[^h3316] the Gileadite[^h1569] four[^h702] days[^h3117] in a year[^h8141].

###### 1
And after[^h310] Abimelech[^h40] there arose[^h6965] to defend[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] Tola[^h8439] the son[^h1121] of Puah[^h6312], the son[^h1121] of Dodo[^h1734], a man[^h376] of Issachar[^h3485]; and he dwelt[^h3427] in Shamir[^h8069] in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669]. 
###### 2
And he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] twenty[^h6242] and three[^h7969] years[^h8141], and died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in Shamir[^h8069].
###### 3
And after[^h310] him arose[^h6965] Jair[^h2971], a Gileadite[^h1569], and judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] years[^h8141].
###### 4
And he had thirty[^h7970] sons[^h1121] that rode[^h7392] on thirty[^h7970] ass colts[^h5895], and they had thirty[^h7970] cities[^h5892], which are called[^h7121] Havothjair[^h2334] unto this day[^h3117], which are in the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568]. 
###### 5
And Jair[^h2971] died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in Camon[^h7056].
###### 6
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] again[^h3254] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] Baalim[^h1168], and Ashtaroth[^h6252], and the gods[^h430] of Syria[^h758], and the gods[^h430] of Zidon[^h6721], and the gods[^h430] of Moab[^h4124], and the gods[^h430] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and the gods[^h430] of the Philistines[^h6430], and forsook[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], and served[^h5647] not him.
###### 7
And the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was hot[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478], and he sold[^h4376] them into the hands[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430], and into the hands[^h3027] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983].
###### 8
And that year[^h8141] they vexed[^h7492] and oppressed[^h7533] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] years[^h8141], all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] that were on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383] in the land[^h776] of the Amorites[^h567], which is in Gilead[^h1568]. 
###### 9
Moreover the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] passed over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to fight[^h3898] also against Judah[^h3063], and against Benjamin[^h1144], and against the house[^h1004] of Ephraim[^h669]; so that Israel[^h3478] was sore[^h3966] distressed[^h3334].
###### 10
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], We have sinned[^h2398] against thee, both because we have forsaken[^h5800] our God[^h430], and also served[^h5647] Baalim[^h1168].
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians[^h4714], and from the Amorites[^h567], from the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and from the Philistines[^h6430]?
###### 12
The Zidonians[^h6722] also, and the Amalekites[^h6002], and the Maonites[^h4584], did oppress[^h3905] you; and ye cried[^h6817] to me, and I delivered[^h3467] you out of their hand[^h3027].
###### 13
Yet ye have forsaken[^h5800] me, and served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430]: wherefore I will deliver[^h3467] you no more[^h3254].
###### 14
Go[^h3212] and cry[^h2199] unto the gods[^h430] which ye have chosen[^h977]; let them[^h1992] deliver[^h3467] you in the time[^h6256] of your tribulation[^h6869].
###### 15
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068], We have sinned[^h2398]: do[^h6213] thou unto us whatsoever seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto thee; deliver[^h5337] us only, we pray thee, this day[^h3117]. 
###### 16
And they put away[^h5493] the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430] from among[^h7130] them, and served[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068]: and his soul[^h5315] was grieved[^h7114] for the misery[^h5999] of Israel[^h3478].  
###### 17
Then the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] were gathered together[^h6817], and encamped[^h2583] in Gilead[^h1568]. And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] assembled themselves together[^h622], and encamped[^h2583] in Mizpeh[^h4709]. 
###### 18
And the people[^h5971] and princes[^h8269] of Gilead[^h1568] said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], What man[^h376] is he that will begin[^h2490] to fight[^h3898] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]? he shall be head[^h7218] over all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gilead[^h1568].

###### 1
And Samson[^h8123] went down[^h3381] to Timnath[^h8553], and saw[^h7200] a woman[^h802] in Timnath[^h8553] of the daughters[^h1323] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 2
And he came up[^h5927], and told[^h5046] his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517], and said[^h559], I have seen[^h7200] a woman[^h802] in Timnath[^h8553] of the daughters[^h1323] of the Philistines[^h6430]: now therefore get[^h3947] her for me to wife[^h802].
###### 3
Then his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517] said[^h559] unto him, Is there never[^h369] a woman[^h802] among the daughters[^h1323] of thy brethren[^h251], or among all my people[^h5971], that thou goest[^h1980] to take[^h3947] a wife[^h802] of the uncircumcised[^h6189] Philistines[^h6430]? And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto his father[^h1], Get[^h3947] her for me; for she pleaseth me well[^h3474] [^h5869]. 
###### 4
But his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517] knew[^h3045] not that it was of the LORD[^h3068], that he sought[^h1245] an occasion[^h8385] against the Philistines[^h6430]: for at that time[^h6256] the Philistines[^h6430] had dominion[^h4910] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
Then went[^h3381] Samson[^h8123] down[^h3381], and his father[^h1] and his mother[^h517], to Timnath[^h8553], and came[^h935] to the vineyards[^h3754] of Timnath[^h8553]: and, behold, a young[^h3715] lion[^h738] roared[^h7580] against[^h7125] him. 
###### 6
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came mightily[^h6743] upon him, and he rent[^h8156] him as he would have rent[^h8156] a kid[^h1423], and he had nothing[^h3972] in his hand[^h3027]: but he told[^h5046] not his father[^h1] or his mother[^h517] what he had done[^h6213].
###### 7
And he went down[^h3381], and talked[^h1696] with the woman[^h802]; and she pleased[^h3474] Samson[^h8123] well[^h3474] [^h5869].
###### 8
And after a time[^h3117] he returned[^h7725] to take[^h3947] her, and he turned aside[^h5493] to see[^h7200] the carcase[^h4658] of the lion[^h738]: and, behold, there was a swarm[^h5712] of bees[^h1682] and honey[^h1706] in the carcase[^h1472] of the lion[^h738].
###### 9
And he took[^h7287] thereof in his hands[^h3709], and went on[^h3212] eating[^h398], and came[^h1980] to his father[^h1] and mother[^h517], and he gave[^h5414] them, and they did eat[^h398]: but he told[^h5046] not them that he had taken[^h7287] the honey[^h1706] out of the carcase[^h1472] of the lion[^h738].
###### 10
So his father[^h1] went down[^h3381] unto the woman[^h802]: and Samson[^h8123] made[^h6213] there a feast[^h4960]; for so used the young men[^h970] to do[^h6213].
###### 11
And it came to pass, when they saw[^h7200] him, that they brought[^h3947] thirty[^h7970] companions[^h4828] to be with him.
###### 12
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto them, I will now put forth[^h2330] a riddle[^h2420] unto you: if ye can certainly[^h5046] declare[^h5046] it me within the seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] of the feast[^h4960], and find it out[^h4672], then I will give[^h5414] you thirty[^h7970] sheets[^h5466] and thirty[^h7970] change[^h2487] of garments[^h899]: 
###### 13
But if ye cannot[^h3201] declare[^h5046] it me, then shall ye give[^h5414] me thirty[^h7970] sheets[^h5466] and thirty[^h7970] change[^h2487] of garments[^h899]. And they said[^h559] unto him, Put forth[^h2330] thy riddle[^h2420], that we may hear[^h8085] it. 
###### 14
And he said[^h559] unto them, Out of the eater[^h398] came forth[^h3318] meat[^h3978], and out of the strong[^h5794] came forth[^h3318] sweetness[^h4966]. And they could[^h3201] not in three[^h7969] days[^h3117] expound[^h5046] the riddle[^h2420].
###### 15
And it came to pass on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], that they said[^h559] unto Samson's[^h8123] wife[^h802], Entice[^h6601] thy husband[^h376], that he may declare[^h5046] unto us the riddle[^h2420], lest we burn[^h8313] thee and thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004] with fire[^h784]: have ye called[^h7121] us to take that we have[^h3423]? is it not so? 
###### 16
And Samson's[^h8123] wife[^h802] wept[^h1058] before him, and said[^h559], Thou dost but hate[^h8130] me, and lovest[^h157] me not: thou hast put forth[^h2330] a riddle[^h2420] unto the children[^h1121] of my people[^h5971], and hast not told[^h5046] it me. And he said[^h559] unto her, Behold, I have not told[^h5046] it my father[^h1] nor my mother[^h517], and shall I tell[^h5046] it thee?
###### 17
And she wept[^h1058] before him the seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], while their feast[^h4960] lasted[^h1961]: and it came to pass on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117], that he told[^h5046] her, because she lay sore[^h6693] upon him: and she told[^h5046] the riddle[^h2420] to the children[^h1121] of her people[^h5971]. 
###### 18
And the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] said[^h559] unto him on the seventh[^h7637] day[^h3117] before the sun[^h2775] went down[^h935], What is sweeter[^h4966] than honey[^h1706]? and what is stronger[^h5794] than a lion[^h738]? And he said[^h559] unto them, If[^h3884] ye had not plowed[^h2790] with my heifer[^h5697], ye had not found out[^h4672] my riddle[^h2420].
###### 19
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h6743] upon him, and he went down[^h3381] to Ashkelon[^h831], and slew[^h5221] thirty[^h7970] men[^h376] of them, and took[^h3947] their spoil[^h2488], and gave[^h5414] change[^h2487] of garments unto them which expounded[^h5046] the riddle[^h2420]. And his anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734], and he went up[^h5927] to his father's[^h1] house[^h1004]. 
###### 20
But Samson's[^h8123] wife[^h802] was given to his companion[^h4828], whom he had used as his friend[^h7462].

###### 1
Then went[^h3212] Samson[^h8123] to Gaza[^h5804], and saw[^h7200] there an harlot[^h802] [^h2181], and went in[^h935] unto her. 
###### 2
And it was told the Gazites[^h5841], saying[^h559], Samson[^h8123] is come[^h935] hither. And they compassed him in[^h5437], and laid wait[^h693] for him all night[^h3915] in the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892], and were quiet[^h2790] all the night[^h3915], saying[^h559], In the morning[^h1242], when it is day[^h216], we shall kill[^h2026] him. 
###### 3
And Samson[^h8123] lay[^h7901] till midnight[^h2677] [^h3915], and arose[^h6965] at midnight[^h2677] [^h3915], and took[^h270] the doors[^h1817] of the gate[^h8179] of the city[^h5892], and the two[^h8147] posts[^h4201], and went away[^h5265] with them, bar[^h1280] and all, and put[^h7760] them upon his shoulders[^h3802], and carried them up[^h5927] to the top[^h7218] of an hill[^h2022] that is before[^h6440] Hebron[^h2275]. 
###### 4
And it came to pass afterward[^h310], that he loved[^h157] a woman[^h802] in the valley[^h5158] of Sorek[^h7796], whose name[^h8034] was Delilah[^h1807]. 
###### 5
And the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] came up[^h5927] unto her, and said[^h559] unto her, Entice[^h6601] him, and see[^h7200] wherein his great[^h1419] strength[^h3581] lieth, and by what means we may prevail[^h3201] against him, that we may bind[^h631] him to afflict[^h6031] him: and we will give[^h5414] thee every one[^h376] of us eleven hundred[^h505] [^h3967] pieces of silver[^h3701]. 
###### 6
And Delilah[^h1807] said[^h559] to Samson[^h8123], Tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, wherein thy great[^h1419] strength[^h3581] lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound[^h631] to afflict[^h6031] thee.
###### 7
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto her, If they bind[^h631] me with seven[^h7651] green[^h3892] withs[^h3499] that were never dried[^h2717], then shall I be weak[^h2470], and be as another[^h259] man[^h120].  
###### 8
Then the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] brought up[^h5927] to her seven[^h7651] green[^h3892] withs[^h3499] which had not been dried[^h2717], and she bound[^h631] him with them. 
###### 9
Now there were men lying in wait[^h693], abiding[^h3427] with her in the chamber[^h2315]. And she said[^h559] unto him, The Philistines[^h6430] be upon thee, Samson[^h8123]. And he brake[^h5423] the withs[^h3499], as a thread[^h6616] of tow[^h5296] is broken[^h5423] when it toucheth[^h7306] the fire[^h784]. So his strength[^h3581] was not known[^h3045]. 
###### 10
And Delilah[^h1807] said[^h559] unto Samson[^h8123], Behold, thou hast mocked[^h2048] me, and told[^h1696] me lies[^h3577]: now tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound[^h631].
###### 11
And he said[^h559] unto her, If they bind[^h631] me fast[^h631] with new[^h2319] ropes[^h5688] that never were occupied[^h4399] [^h6213], then shall I be weak[^h2470], and be as another[^h259] man[^h120]. 
###### 12
Delilah[^h1807] therefore took[^h3947] new[^h2319] ropes[^h5688], and bound[^h631] him therewith, and said[^h559] unto him, The Philistines[^h6430] be upon thee, Samson[^h8123]. And there were liers in wait[^h693] abiding[^h3427] in the chamber[^h2315]. And he brake[^h5423] them from off his arms[^h2220] like a thread[^h2339].
###### 13
And Delilah[^h1807] said[^h559] unto Samson[^h8123], Hitherto[^h2008] thou hast mocked[^h2048] me, and told[^h1696] me lies[^h3577]: tell[^h5046] me wherewith thou mightest be bound[^h631]. And he said[^h559] unto her, If thou weavest[^h707] the seven[^h7651] locks[^h4253] of my head[^h7218] with the web[^h4545].
###### 14
And she fastened[^h8628] it with the pin[^h3489], and said[^h559] unto him, The Philistines[^h6430] be upon thee, Samson[^h8123]. And he awaked[^h3364] out of his sleep[^h8142], and went away[^h5265] with the pin[^h3489] of the beam[^h708], and with the web[^h4545].
###### 15
And she said[^h559] unto him, How[^h349] canst thou say[^h559], I love[^h157] thee, when thine heart[^h3820] is not with me? thou hast mocked[^h2048] me these three[^h7969] times[^h6471], and hast not told[^h5046] me wherein thy great[^h1419] strength[^h3581] lieth.
###### 16
And it came to pass, when she pressed[^h6693] him daily[^h3117] with her words[^h1697], and urged[^h509] him, so that his soul[^h5315] was vexed[^h7114] unto death[^h4191]; 
###### 17
That he told[^h5046] her all his heart[^h3820], and said[^h559] unto her, There hath not come[^h5927] a razor[^h4177] upon mine head[^h7218]; for I have been a Nazarite[^h5139] unto God[^h430] from my mother's[^h517] womb[^h990]: if I be shaven[^h1548], then my strength[^h3581] will go[^h5493] from me, and I shall become weak[^h2470], and be like any other man[^h120].
###### 18
And when Delilah[^h1807] saw[^h7200] that he had told[^h5046] her all his heart[^h3820], she sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] for the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430], saying[^h559], Come up[^h5927] this once[^h6471], for he hath shewed[^h5046] me all his heart[^h3820]. Then the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] came up[^h5927] unto her, and brought[^h5927] money[^h3701] in their hand[^h3027].
###### 19
And she made him sleep[^h3462] upon her knees[^h1290]; and she called[^h7121] for a man[^h376], and she caused him to shave off[^h1548] the seven[^h7651] locks[^h4253] of his head[^h7218]; and she began[^h2490] to afflict[^h6031] him, and his strength[^h3581] went[^h5493] from him.
###### 20
And she said[^h559], The Philistines[^h6430] be upon thee, Samson[^h8123]. And he awoke[^h3364] out of his sleep[^h8142], and said[^h559], I will go out[^h3318] as at other times before[^h6471], and shake[^h5287] myself. And he wist[^h3045] not that the LORD[^h3068] was departed[^h5493] from him.
###### 21
But the Philistines[^h6430] took[^h270] him, and put out[^h5365] his eyes[^h5869], and brought him down[^h3381] to Gaza[^h5804], and bound[^h631] him with fetters of brass[^h5178]; and he did grind[^h2912] in the prison[^h631] house[^h1004]. 
###### 22
Howbeit the hair[^h8181] of his head[^h7218] began[^h2490] to grow again[^h6779] after[^h834] he was shaven[^h1548]. 
###### 23
Then the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] gathered them together[^h622] for to offer[^h2076] a great[^h1419] sacrifice[^h2077] unto Dagon[^h1712] their god[^h430], and to rejoice[^h8057]: for they said[^h559], Our god[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] Samson[^h8123] our enemy[^h341] into our hand[^h3027].
###### 24
And when the people[^h5971] saw[^h7200] him, they praised[^h1984] their god[^h430]: for they said[^h559], Our god[^h430] hath delivered[^h5414] into our hands[^h3027] our enemy[^h341], and the destroyer[^h2717] of our country[^h776], which slew[^h2491] many[^h7235] of us. 
###### 25
And it came to pass, when their hearts[^h3820] were merry[^h2896], that they said[^h559], Call[^h7121] for Samson[^h8123], that he may make us sport[^h7832]. And they called[^h7121] for Samson[^h8123] out of the prison[^h631] house[^h1004]; and he made them[^h6440] sport[^h6711]: and they set[^h5975] him between the pillars[^h5982]. 
###### 26
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto the lad[^h5288] that held[^h2388] him by the hand[^h3027], Suffer[^h3240] me that I may feel[^h4184] [^h3237] the pillars[^h5982] whereupon the house[^h1004] standeth[^h3559], that I may lean[^h8172] upon them.
###### 27
Now the house[^h1004] was full[^h4390] of men[^h582] and women[^h802]; and all the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] were there; and there were upon the roof[^h1406] about three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] and women[^h802], that beheld[^h7200] while Samson[^h8123] made sport[^h7832].
###### 28
And Samson[^h8123] called[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], remember[^h2142] me, I pray thee, and strengthen[^h2388] me, I pray thee, only this once[^h6471], O God[^h430], that I may be at once[^h259] avenged[^h5358] [^h5359] of the Philistines[^h6430] for my two[^h8147] eyes[^h5869].
###### 29
And Samson[^h8123] took hold[^h3943] of the two[^h8147] middle[^h8432] pillars[^h5982] upon which the house[^h1004] stood[^h3559], and on which it was borne up[^h5564], of the one[^h259] with his right hand[^h3225], and of the other[^h259] with his left[^h8040]. 
###### 30
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559], Let me die[^h4191] [^h5315] with the Philistines[^h6430]. And he bowed[^h5186] himself with all his might[^h3581]; and the house[^h1004] fell[^h5307] upon the lords[^h5633], and upon all the people[^h5971] that were therein. So the dead[^h4191] which he slew[^h4191] at his death[^h4194] were more[^h7227] than they which he slew[^h4191] in his life[^h2416]. 
###### 31
Then his brethren[^h251] and all the house[^h1004] of his father[^h1] came down[^h3381], and took[^h5375] him, and brought him up[^h5927], and buried[^h6912] him between Zorah[^h6881] and Eshtaol[^h847] in the buryingplace[^h6913] of Manoah[^h4495] his father[^h1]. And he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141].

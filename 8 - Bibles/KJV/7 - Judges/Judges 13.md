###### 1
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] again[^h3254] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]; and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430] forty[^h705] years[^h8141]. 
###### 2
And there was a certain[^h259] man[^h376] of Zorah[^h6881], of the family[^h4940] of the Danites[^h1839], whose name[^h8034] was Manoah[^h4495]; and his wife[^h802] was barren[^h6135], and bare[^h3205] not.
###### 3
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto the woman[^h802], and said[^h559] unto her, Behold now, thou art barren[^h6135], and bearest[^h3205] not: but thou shalt conceive[^h2029], and bear[^h3205] a son[^h1121].
###### 4
Now therefore beware[^h8104], I pray thee, and drink[^h8354] not wine[^h3196] nor strong drink[^h7941], and eat[^h398] not any unclean[^h2931] thing:
###### 5
For, lo, thou shalt conceive[^h2030], and bear[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and no razor[^h4177] shall come[^h5927] on his head[^h7218]: for the child[^h5288] shall be a Nazarite[^h5139] unto God[^h430] from the womb[^h990]: and he shall begin[^h2490] to deliver[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 6
Then the woman[^h802] came[^h935] and told[^h559] her husband[^h376], saying[^h559], A man[^h376] of God[^h430] came[^h935] unto me, and his countenance[^h4758] was like the countenance[^h4758] of an angel[^h4397] of God[^h430], very[^h3966] terrible[^h3372]: but I asked[^h7592] him not whence he was, neither told[^h5046] he me his name[^h8034]:
###### 7
But he said[^h559] unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive[^h2030], and bear[^h3205] a son[^h1121]; and now drink[^h7941] no wine[^h3196] nor strong drink[^h8354], neither eat[^h398] any unclean[^h2932] thing: for the child[^h5288] shall be a Nazarite[^h5139] to God[^h430] from the womb[^h990] to the day[^h3117] of his death[^h4194].
###### 8
Then Manoah[^h4495] intreated[^h6279] the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], O[^h994] my Lord[^h136], let[^h4994] the man[^h376] of God[^h430] which thou didst send[^h7971] come again[^h935] unto us, and teach[^h3384] us what we shall do[^h6213] unto the child[^h5288] that shall be born[^h3205].
###### 9
And God[^h430] hearkened[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of Manoah[^h4495]; and the angel[^h4397] of God[^h430] came again[^h935] unto the woman[^h802] as she sat[^h3427] in the field[^h7704]: but Manoah[^h4495] her husband[^h376] was not with her.
###### 10
And the woman[^h802] made haste[^h4116], and ran[^h7323], and shewed[^h5046] her husband[^h376], and said[^h559] unto him, Behold, the man[^h376] hath appeared[^h7200] unto me, that came[^h935] unto me the other day[^h3117].
###### 11
And Manoah[^h4495] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] after[^h310] his wife[^h802], and came[^h935] to the man[^h376], and said[^h559] unto him, Art thou the man[^h376] that spakest[^h1696] unto the woman[^h802]? And he said[^h559], I am.
###### 12
And Manoah[^h4495] said[^h559], Now let thy words[^h1697] come to pass[^h935]. How shall we order[^h4941] the child[^h5288], and how shall we do[^h4639] unto him?  
###### 13
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Manoah[^h4495], Of all that I said[^h559] unto the woman[^h802] let her beware[^h8104].
###### 14
She may not eat[^h398] of any thing that cometh[^h3318] of the vine[^h1612], neither let her drink[^h8354] wine[^h3196] or strong drink[^h7941], nor eat[^h398] any unclean[^h2932] thing: all that I commanded[^h6680] her let her observe[^h8104].
###### 15
And Manoah[^h4495] said[^h559] unto the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], I pray thee, let us detain[^h6113] thee, until we shall have made ready[^h6213] a kid[^h1423] [^h5795] for[^h6440] thee. 
###### 16
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Manoah[^h4495], Though thou detain[^h6113] me, I will not eat[^h398] of thy bread[^h3899]: and if[^h518] thou wilt offer[^h6213] a burnt offering[^h5930], thou must offer[^h5927] it unto the LORD[^h3068]. For Manoah[^h4495] knew[^h3045] not that he was an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
And Manoah[^h4495] said[^h559] unto the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], What is thy name[^h8034], that when thy sayings[^h1697] come to pass[^h935] we may do thee honour[^h3513]?
###### 18
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Why askest[^h7592] thou thus after my name[^h8034], seeing it is secret[^h6383] [^h6383]? 
###### 19
So Manoah[^h4495] took[^h3947] a kid[^h1423] [^h5795] with a meat offering[^h4503], and offered[^h5927] it upon a rock[^h6697] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and the angel did[^h6213] wondrously[^h6381]; and Manoah[^h4495] and his wife[^h802] looked on[^h7200].
###### 20
For it came to pass, when the flame[^h3851] went up[^h5927] toward heaven[^h8064] from off the altar[^h4196], that the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] ascended[^h5927] in the flame[^h3851] of the altar[^h4196]. And Manoah[^h4495] and his wife[^h802] looked on[^h7200] it, and fell on[^h5307] their faces[^h6440] to the ground[^h776].
###### 21
But the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] did no more[^h3254] appear[^h7200] to Manoah[^h4495] and to his wife[^h802]. Then Manoah[^h4495] knew[^h3045] that he was an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
And Manoah[^h4495] said[^h559] unto his wife[^h802], We shall surely[^h4191] die[^h4191], because we have seen[^h7200] God[^h430].
###### 23
But his wife[^h802] said[^h559] unto him, If[^h3863] the LORD[^h3068] were pleased[^h2654] to kill[^h4191] us, he would not have received[^h3947] a burnt offering[^h5930] and a meat offering[^h4503] at our hands[^h3027], neither would he have shewed[^h7200] us all these things, nor would as at this time[^h6256] have told[^h8085] us such things as these[^h2063].
###### 24
And the woman[^h802] bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Samson[^h8123]: and the child[^h5288] grew[^h1431], and the LORD[^h3068] blessed[^h1288] him.
###### 25
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] began[^h2490] to move him at times[^h6470] in the camp[^h4264] of Dan[^h1835] between Zorah[^h6881] and Eshtaol[^h847].

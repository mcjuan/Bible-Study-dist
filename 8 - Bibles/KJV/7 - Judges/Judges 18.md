###### 1
In those days[^h3117] there was no king[^h4428] in Israel[^h3478]: and in those days[^h3117] the tribe[^h7626] of the Danites[^h1839] sought[^h1245] them an inheritance[^h5159] to dwell in[^h3427]; for unto that day[^h3117] all their inheritance[^h5159] had not fallen[^h5307] unto them among[^h8432] the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
And the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835] sent[^h7971] of their family[^h4940] five[^h2568] men[^h582] from their coasts[^h7098], men[^h1121] of valour[^h2428], from Zorah[^h6881], and from Eshtaol[^h847], to spy[^h7270] out the land[^h776], and to search[^h2713] it; and they said[^h559] unto them, Go[^h3212], search[^h2713] the land[^h776]: who when they came[^h935] to mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], to the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318], they lodged[^h3885] there. 
###### 3
When they were by the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318], they knew[^h5234] the voice[^h6963] of the young man[^h5288] the Levite[^h3881]: and they turned in[^h5493] thither, and said[^h559] unto him, Who brought[^h935] thee hither[^h1988]? and what makest[^h6213] thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
###### 4
And he said[^h559] unto them, Thus[^h2090] and thus[^h2090] dealeth[^h6213] Micah[^h4318] with me, and hath hired[^h7936] me, and I am his priest[^h3548].
###### 5
And they said[^h559] unto him, Ask counsel[^h7592], we pray thee, of God[^h430], that we may know[^h3045] whether our way[^h1870] which we go[^h1980] shall be prosperous[^h6743].
###### 6
And the priest[^h3548] said[^h559] unto them, Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965]: before[^h5227] the LORD[^h3068] is your way[^h1870] wherein ye go[^h3212].
###### 7
Then the five[^h2568] men[^h582] departed[^h3212], and came[^h935] to Laish[^h3919], and saw[^h7200] the people[^h5971] that were therein[^h7130], how they dwelt[^h3427] careless[^h983], after the manner[^h4941] of the Zidonians[^h6722], quiet[^h8252] and secure[^h982]; and there was no magistrate[^h3423] [^h6114] in the land[^h776], that might put them to shame[^h3637] in any thing[^h1697]; and they were far[^h7350] from the Zidonians[^h6722], and had no business[^h1697] with any man[^h120]. 
###### 8
And they came[^h935] unto their brethren[^h251] to Zorah[^h6881] and Eshtaol[^h847]: and their brethren[^h251] said[^h559] unto them, What say ye?
###### 9
And they said[^h559], Arise[^h6965], that we may go up[^h5927] against them: for we have seen[^h7200] the land[^h776], and, behold, it is very[^h3966] good[^h2896]: and are ye still[^h2814]? be not slothful[^h6101] to go[^h3212], and to enter[^h935] to possess[^h3423] the land[^h776].
###### 10
When ye go[^h935], ye shall come[^h935] unto a people[^h5971] secure[^h982], and to a large[^h7342] land[^h776]: for God[^h430] hath given[^h5414] it into your hands[^h3027]; a place[^h4725] where there is no want[^h4270] of any thing[^h1697] that is in the earth[^h776].
###### 11
And there went[^h5265] from thence of the family[^h4940] of the Danites[^h1839], out of Zorah[^h6881] and out of Eshtaol[^h847], six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] appointed[^h2296] with weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421]. 
###### 12
And they went up[^h5927], and pitched[^h2583] in Kirjathjearim[^h7157], in Judah[^h3063]: wherefore they called[^h7121] that place[^h4725] Mahanehdan[^h4265] unto this day[^h3117]: behold, it is behind[^h310] Kirjathjearim[^h7157].
###### 13
And they passed[^h5674] thence unto mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and came[^h935] unto the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318].
###### 14
Then answered[^h6030] the five[^h2568] men[^h582] that went[^h1980] to spy out[^h7270] the country[^h776] of Laish[^h3919], and said[^h559] unto their brethren[^h251], Do ye know[^h3045] that there is[^h3426] in these houses[^h1004] an ephod[^h646], and teraphim[^h8655], and a graven image[^h6459], and a molten image[^h4541]? now therefore consider[^h3045] what ye have to do[^h6213].
###### 15
And they turned[^h5493] thitherward, and came[^h935] to the house[^h1004] of the young man[^h5288] the Levite[^h3881], even unto the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318], and saluted[^h7592] [^h7965] him. 
###### 16
And the six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] appointed[^h2296] with their weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421], which were of the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835], stood[^h5324] by the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179].
###### 17
And the five[^h2568] men[^h582] that went[^h1980] to spy out[^h7270] the land[^h776] went up[^h5927], and came in[^h935] thither, and took[^h3947] the graven image[^h6459], and the ephod[^h646], and the teraphim[^h8655], and the molten image[^h4541]: and the priest[^h3548] stood[^h5324] in the entering[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] with the six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that were appointed[^h2296] with weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421].
###### 18
And these went[^h935] into Micah's[^h4318] house[^h1004], and fetched[^h3947] the carved image[^h6459], the ephod[^h646], and the teraphim[^h8655], and the molten image[^h4541]. Then said[^h559] the priest[^h3548] unto them, What do[^h6213] ye?
###### 19
And they said[^h559] unto him, Hold thy peace[^h2790], lay[^h7760] thine hand[^h3027] upon thy mouth[^h6310], and go[^h3212] with us, and be to us[^h1961] a father[^h1] and a priest[^h3548]: is it better[^h2896] for thee to be a priest[^h3548] unto the house[^h1004] of one[^h259] man[^h376], or that thou be a priest[^h3548] unto a tribe[^h7626] and a family[^h4940] in Israel[^h3478]?
###### 20
And the priest's[^h3548] heart[^h3820] was glad[^h3190], and he took[^h3947] the ephod[^h646], and the teraphim[^h8655], and the graven image[^h6459], and went in[^h935] the midst[^h7130] of the people[^h5971].
###### 21
So they turned[^h6437] and departed[^h3212], and put[^h7760] the little ones[^h2945] and the cattle[^h4735] and the carriage[^h3520] before[^h6440] them.
###### 22
And when they were a good way[^h7368] from the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318], the men[^h582] that were in the houses[^h1004] near to Micah's[^h4318] house[^h1004] were gathered together[^h2199], and overtook[^h1692] the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835].
###### 23
And they cried[^h7121] unto the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835]. And they turned[^h5437] their faces[^h6440], and said[^h559] unto Micah[^h4318], What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company[^h2199]? 
###### 24
And he said[^h559], Ye have taken away[^h3947] my gods[^h430] which I made[^h6213], and the priest[^h3548], and ye are gone away[^h3212]: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say[^h559] unto me, What aileth thee?
###### 25
And the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835] said[^h559] unto him, Let not thy voice[^h6963] be heard[^h8085] among us, lest angry[^h4751] [^h5315] fellows[^h582] run[^h6293] upon thee, and thou lose[^h622] thy life[^h5315], with the lives[^h5315] of thy household[^h1004]. 
###### 26
And the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835] went[^h3212] their way[^h1870]: and when Micah[^h4318] saw[^h7200] that they were too strong[^h2389] for him, he turned[^h6437] and went back[^h7725] unto his house[^h1004].
###### 27
And they took[^h3947] the things which Micah[^h4318] had made[^h6213], and the priest[^h3548] which he had, and came[^h935] unto Laish[^h3919], unto a people[^h5971] that were at quiet[^h8252] and secure[^h982]: and they smote[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], and burnt[^h8313] the city[^h5892] with fire[^h784].
###### 28
And there was no deliverer[^h5337], because it was far[^h7350] from Zidon[^h6721], and they had no business[^h1697] with any man[^h120]; and it was in the valley[^h6010] that lieth by Bethrehob[^h1050]. And they built[^h1129] a city[^h5892], and dwelt[^h3427] therein.
###### 29
And they called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] Dan[^h1835], after the name[^h8034] of Dan[^h1835] their father[^h1], who was born[^h3205] unto Israel[^h3478]: howbeit[^h199] the name[^h8034] of the city[^h5892] was Laish[^h3919] at the first[^h7223].
###### 30
And the children[^h1121] of Dan[^h1835] set up[^h6965] the graven image[^h6459]: and Jonathan[^h3083], the son[^h1121] of Gershom[^h1647], the son[^h1121] of Manasseh[^h4519], he and his sons[^h1121] were priests[^h3548] to the tribe[^h7626] of Dan[^h1839] until the day[^h3117] of the captivity[^h1540] of the land[^h776].
###### 31
And they set them up[^h7760] Micah's[^h4318] graven image[^h6459], which he made[^h6213], all the time[^h3117] that the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] was in Shiloh[^h7887].

###### 1
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Midian[^h4080] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141].
###### 2
And the hand[^h3027] of Midian[^h4080] prevailed[^h5810] against Israel[^h3478]: and because[^h6440] of the Midianites[^h4080] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] made[^h6213] them the dens[^h4492] which are in the mountains[^h2022], and caves[^h4631], and strong holds[^h4679]. 
###### 3
And so it was, when Israel[^h3478] had sown[^h2232], that the Midianites[^h4080] came up[^h5927], and the Amalekites[^h6002], and the children[^h1121] of the east[^h6924], even they came up[^h5927] against them;
###### 4
And they encamped[^h2583] against them, and destroyed[^h7843] the increase[^h2981] of the earth[^h776], till thou come[^h935] unto Gaza[^h5804], and left[^h7604] no sustenance[^h4241] for Israel[^h3478], neither sheep[^h7716], nor ox[^h7794], nor ass[^h2543]. 
###### 5
For they came up[^h5927] with their cattle[^h4735] and their tents[^h168], and they came[^h935] [^h935] as[^h1767] grasshoppers[^h697] for multitude[^h7230]; for both they and their camels[^h1581] were without number[^h4557]: and they entered[^h935] into the land[^h776] to destroy[^h7843] it.
###### 6
And Israel[^h3478] was greatly[^h3966] impoverished[^h1809] because[^h6440] of the Midianites[^h4080]; and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
And it came to pass, when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068] because[^h182] of the Midianites[^h4080],
###### 8
That the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] a prophet[^h376] [^h5030] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], which said[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], I brought you up[^h5927] from Egypt[^h4714], and brought you forth[^h3318] out of the house[^h1004] of bondage[^h5650]; 
###### 9
And I delivered[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714], and out of the hand[^h3027] of all that oppressed[^h3905] you, and drave them out[^h1644] from before[^h6440] you, and gave[^h5414] you their land[^h776];
###### 10
And I said[^h559] unto you, I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; fear[^h3372] not the gods[^h430] of the Amorites[^h567], in whose land[^h776] ye dwell[^h3427]: but ye have not obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963].
###### 11
And there came[^h935] an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], and sat[^h3427] under an oak[^h424] which was in Ophrah[^h6084], that pertained unto Joash[^h3101] the Abiezrite[^h33]: and his son[^h1121] Gideon[^h1439] threshed[^h2251] wheat[^h2406] by the winepress[^h1660], to hide[^h5127] it from[^h6440] the Midianites[^h4080].  
###### 12
And the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] unto him, and said[^h559] unto him, The LORD[^h3068] is with thee, thou mighty[^h1368] man of valour[^h2428].
###### 13
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559] unto him, Oh[^h994] my Lord[^h113], if[^h3426] the LORD[^h3068] be with us, why then is all this befallen[^h4672] us? and where be all his miracles[^h6381] which our fathers[^h1] told[^h5608] us of, saying[^h559], Did not the LORD[^h3068] bring us up[^h5927] from Egypt[^h4714]? but now the LORD[^h3068] hath forsaken[^h5203] us, and delivered[^h5414] us into the hands[^h3709] of the Midianites[^h4080].
###### 14
And the LORD[^h3068] looked[^h6437] upon him, and said[^h559], Go[^h3212] in this thy might[^h3581], and thou shalt save[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] from the hand[^h3709] of the Midianites[^h4080]: have not I sent[^h7971] thee?
###### 15
And he said[^h559] unto him, Oh[^h994] my Lord[^h136], wherewith[^h4100] shall I save[^h3467] Israel[^h3478]? behold, my family[^h504] [^h505] is poor[^h1800] in Manasseh[^h4519], and I am the least[^h6810] in my father's[^h1] house[^h1004]. 
###### 16
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite[^h5221] the Midianites[^h4080] as one[^h259] man[^h376].
###### 17
And he said[^h559] unto him, If now I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869], then shew[^h6213] me a sign[^h226] that thou talkest[^h1696] with me.
###### 18
Depart[^h4185] not hence, I pray thee, until I come[^h935] unto thee, and bring forth[^h3318] my present[^h4503], and set[^h3240] it before[^h6440] thee. And he said[^h559], I will tarry[^h3427] until thou come again[^h7725]. 
###### 19
And Gideon[^h1439] went in[^h935], and made ready[^h6213] a kid[^h5795] [^h1423], and unleavened cakes[^h4682] of an ephah[^h374] of flour[^h7058]: the flesh[^h1320] he put[^h7760] in a basket[^h5536], and he put[^h7760] the broth[^h4839] in a pot[^h6517], and brought it out[^h3318] unto him under the oak[^h424], and presented[^h5066] it. 
###### 20
And the angel[^h4397] of God[^h430] said[^h559] unto him, Take[^h3947] the flesh[^h1320] and the unleavened cakes[^h4682], and lay[^h3240] them upon this[^h1975] rock[^h5553], and pour out[^h8210] the broth[^h4839]. And he did[^h6213] so.
###### 21
Then the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] put forth[^h7971] the end[^h7097] of the staff[^h4938] that was in his hand[^h3027], and touched[^h5060] the flesh[^h1320] and the unleavened cakes[^h4682]; and there rose up[^h5927] fire[^h784] out of the rock[^h6697], and consumed[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] and the unleavened cakes[^h4682]. Then the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] departed[^h1980] out of his sight[^h5869].
###### 22
And when Gideon[^h1439] perceived[^h7200] that he was an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068], Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559], Alas[^h162], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]! for because[^h3651] I have seen[^h7200] an angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] face[^h6440] to face[^h6440].
###### 23
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Peace[^h7965] be unto thee; fear[^h3372] not: thou shalt not die[^h4191].
###### 24
Then Gideon[^h1439] built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] there unto the LORD[^h3068], and called[^h7121] it Jehovahshalom[^h3073]: unto this day[^h3117] it is yet in Ophrah[^h6084] of the Abiezrites[^h33]. 
###### 25
And it came to pass the same night[^h3915], that the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Take[^h3947] thy father's[^h1] young[^h6499] bullock[^h7794], even the second[^h8145] bullock[^h6499] of seven[^h7651] years old[^h8141], and throw down[^h2040] the altar[^h4196] of Baal[^h1168] that thy father[^h1] hath, and cut down[^h3772] the grove[^h842] that is by it: 
###### 26
And build[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] upon the top[^h7218] of this rock[^h4581], in the ordered place[^h4634], and take[^h3947] the second[^h8145] bullock[^h6499], and offer[^h5927] a burnt sacrifice[^h5930] with the wood[^h6086] of the grove[^h842] which thou shalt cut down[^h3772].  
###### 27
Then Gideon[^h1439] took[^h3947] ten[^h6235] men[^h582] of his servants[^h5650], and did[^h6213] as the LORD[^h3068] had said[^h1696] unto him: and so it was, because he feared[^h3372] his father's[^h1] household[^h1004], and the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892], that he could not do[^h6213] it by day[^h3119], that he did[^h6213] it by night[^h3915].
###### 28
And when the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] arose early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], behold, the altar[^h4196] of Baal[^h1168] was cast down[^h5422], and the grove[^h842] was cut down[^h3772] that was by it, and the second[^h8145] bullock[^h6499] was offered[^h5927] upon the altar[^h4196] that was built[^h1129].
###### 29
And they said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], Who hath done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]? And when they enquired[^h1875] and asked[^h1245], they said[^h559], Gideon[^h1439] the son[^h1121] of Joash[^h3101] hath done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697].
###### 30
Then the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892] said[^h559] unto Joash[^h3101], Bring out[^h3318] thy son[^h1121], that he may die[^h4191]: because he hath cast down[^h5422] the altar[^h4196] of Baal[^h1168], and because he hath cut down[^h3772] the grove[^h842] that was by it.
###### 31
And Joash[^h3101] said[^h559] unto all that stood[^h5975] against him, Will ye plead[^h7378] for Baal[^h1168]? will ye save[^h3467] him? he that will plead[^h7378] for him, let him be put to death[^h4191] whilst it is yet morning[^h1242]: if he be a god[^h430], let him plead[^h7378] for himself, because one hath cast down[^h5422] his altar[^h4196].
###### 32
Therefore on that day[^h3117] he called[^h7121] him Jerubbaal[^h3378], saying[^h559], Let Baal[^h1168] plead[^h7378] against him, because he hath thrown down[^h5422] his altar[^h4196].  
###### 33
Then all the Midianites[^h4080] and the Amalekites[^h6002] and the children[^h1121] of the east[^h6924] were gathered[^h622] together[^h3162], and went over[^h5674], and pitched[^h2583] in the valley[^h6010] of Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 34
But the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h3847] upon Gideon[^h1439], and he blew[^h8628] a trumpet[^h7782]; and Abiezer[^h44] was gathered[^h2199] after[^h310] him.  
###### 35
And he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] throughout all Manasseh[^h4519]; who also was gathered[^h2199] after[^h310] him: and he sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto Asher[^h836], and unto Zebulun[^h2074], and unto Naphtali[^h5321]; and they came up[^h5927] to meet[^h7125] them. 
###### 36
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], If thou wilt[^h3426] save[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] by mine hand[^h3027], as thou hast said[^h1696],
###### 37
Behold, I will put[^h3322] a fleece[^h1492] of wool[^h6785] in the floor[^h1637]; and if the dew[^h2919] be on the fleece[^h1492] only, and it be dry[^h2721] upon all the earth[^h776] beside, then shall I know[^h3045] that thou wilt save[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] by mine hand[^h3027], as thou hast said[^h1696].
###### 38
And it was so: for he rose up early[^h7925] on the morrow[^h4283], and thrust[^h2115] the fleece[^h1492] together[^h2115], and wringed[^h4680] the dew[^h2919] out of the fleece[^h1492], a bowl[^h5602] full[^h4393] of water[^h4325].
###### 39
And Gideon[^h1439] said[^h559] unto God[^h430], Let not thine anger[^h639] be hot[^h2734] against me, and I will speak[^h1696] but this once[^h6471]: let me prove[^h5254], I pray thee, but this once[^h6471] with the fleece[^h1492]; let it now be dry[^h2721] only upon the fleece[^h1492], and upon all the ground[^h776] let there be dew[^h2919].
###### 40
And God[^h430] did[^h6213] so that night[^h3915]: for it was dry[^h2721] upon the fleece[^h1492] only, and there was dew[^h2919] on all the ground[^h776].

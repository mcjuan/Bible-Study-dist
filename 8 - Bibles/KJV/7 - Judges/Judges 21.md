###### 1
Now the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] had sworn[^h7650] in Mizpeh[^h4709], saying[^h559], There shall not any[^h376] of us give[^h5414] his daughter[^h1323] unto Benjamin[^h1144] to wife[^h802].
###### 2
And the people[^h5971] came[^h935] to the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] [^h1008], and abode[^h3427] there till even[^h6153] before[^h6440] God[^h430], and lifted up[^h5375] their voices[^h6963], and wept[^h1058] [^h1065] sore[^h1419];
###### 3
And said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], why is this come to pass in Israel[^h3478], that there should be to day[^h3117] one[^h259] tribe[^h7626] lacking[^h6485] in Israel[^h3478]?
###### 4
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that the people[^h5971] rose early[^h7925], and built[^h1129] there an altar[^h4196], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002].
###### 5
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Who is there among all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] that[^h834] came[^h5927] not up with the congregation[^h6951] unto the LORD[^h3068]? For they had made a great[^h1419] oath[^h7621] concerning him that came not up[^h5927] to the LORD[^h3068] to Mizpeh[^h4709], saying[^h559], He shall surely[^h4191] be put to death[^h4191].
###### 6
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] repented[^h5162] them for Benjamin[^h1144] their brother[^h251], and said[^h559], There is one[^h259] tribe[^h7626] cut off[^h1438] from Israel[^h3478] this day[^h3117].
###### 7
How shall we do[^h6213] for wives[^h802] for them that remain[^h3498], seeing we have sworn[^h7650] by the LORD[^h3068] that we will not give[^h5414] them of our daughters[^h1323] to wives[^h802]?
###### 8
And they said[^h559], What one[^h259] is there of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] that came not up[^h5927] to Mizpeh[^h4709] to the LORD[^h3068]? And, behold, there came[^h935] none[^h376] to the camp[^h4264] from Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] to the assembly[^h6951].
###### 9
For the people[^h5971] were numbered[^h6485], and, behold, there were none[^h376] of the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] there.
###### 10
And the congregation[^h5712] sent[^h7971] thither twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] of the valiantest[^h1121] [^h2428], and commanded[^h6680] them, saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] and smite[^h5221] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], with the women[^h802] and the children[^h2945].
###### 11
And this is the thing[^h1697] that ye shall do[^h6213], Ye shall utterly destroy[^h2763] every male[^h2145], and every woman[^h802] that hath lain[^h4904] by man[^h3045]. 
###### 12
And they found[^h4672] among the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] young[^h5291] virgins[^h1330], that had known[^h3045] no man[^h376] by lying[^h4904] with any male[^h2145]: and they brought[^h935] them unto the camp[^h4264] to Shiloh[^h7887], which is in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667]. 
###### 13
And the whole congregation[^h5712] sent[^h7971] some to speak[^h1696] to the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] that were in the rock[^h5553] Rimmon[^h7417], and to call[^h7121] peaceably[^h7965] unto them.  
###### 14
And Benjamin[^h1144] came again[^h7725] at that time[^h6256]; and they gave[^h5414] them wives[^h802] which they had saved alive[^h2421] of the women[^h802] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568]: and yet so they sufficed[^h4672] them not.
###### 15
And the people[^h5971] repented[^h5162] them for Benjamin[^h1144], because that the LORD[^h3068] had made[^h6213] a breach[^h6556] in the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 16
Then the elders[^h2205] of the congregation[^h5712] said[^h559], How shall we do[^h6213] for wives[^h802] for them that remain[^h3498], seeing the women[^h802] are destroyed[^h8045] out of Benjamin[^h1144]?
###### 17
And they said[^h559], There must be an inheritance[^h3425] for them that be escaped[^h6413] of Benjamin[^h1144], that a tribe[^h7626] be not destroyed[^h4229] out of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
Howbeit we may[^h3201] not give[^h5414] them wives[^h802] of our daughters[^h1323]: for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] have sworn[^h7650], saying[^h559], Cursed[^h779] be he that giveth[^h5414] a wife[^h802] to Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 19
Then they said[^h559], Behold, there is a feast[^h2282] of the LORD[^h3068] in Shiloh[^h7887] yearly[^h3117] [^h3117] in a place which is on the north side[^h6828] of Bethel[^h1008], on the east side[^h4217] [^h8121] of the highway[^h4546] that goeth up[^h5927] from Bethel[^h1008] to Shechem[^h7927], and on the south[^h5045] of Lebonah[^h3829].   
###### 20
Therefore they commanded[^h6680] the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212] and lie in wait[^h693] in the vineyards[^h3754];
###### 21
And see[^h7200], and, behold, if the daughters[^h1323] of Shiloh[^h7887] come out[^h3318] to dance[^h2342] in dances[^h4246], then come ye out[^h3318] of the vineyards[^h3754], and catch[^h2414] you every man[^h376] his wife[^h802] of the daughters[^h1323] of Shiloh[^h7887], and go[^h1980] to the land[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144].
###### 22
And it shall be, when their fathers[^h1] or their brethren[^h251] come[^h935] unto us to complain[^h7378], that we will say[^h559] unto them, Be favourable[^h2603] unto them for our sakes: because we reserved[^h3947] not to each man[^h376] his wife[^h802] in the war[^h4421]: for ye did not give[^h5414] unto them at this time[^h6256], that ye should be guilty[^h816]. 
###### 23
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] did so[^h6213], and took[^h5375] them wives[^h802], according to their number[^h4557], of them that danced[^h2342], whom they caught[^h1497]: and they went[^h3212] and returned[^h7725] unto their inheritance[^h5159], and repaired[^h1129] the cities[^h5892], and dwelt[^h3427] in them.
###### 24
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] departed[^h1980] thence at that time[^h6256], every man[^h376] to his tribe[^h7626] and to his family[^h4940], and they went out[^h3318] from thence every man[^h376] to his inheritance[^h5159].
###### 25
In those days[^h3117] there was no king[^h4428] in Israel[^h3478]: every man[^h376] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in his own eyes[^h5869].

###### 1
And there was a man[^h376] of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], whose name[^h8034] was Micah[^h4321].
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto his mother[^h517], The eleven hundred[^h505] [^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701] that were taken[^h3947] from thee, about which thou cursedst[^h422], and spakest[^h559] of also in mine ears[^h241], behold, the silver[^h3701] is with me; I took[^h3947] it. And his mother[^h517] said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be thou of the LORD[^h3068], my son[^h1121].
###### 3
And when he had restored[^h7725] the eleven hundred[^h505] [^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701] to his mother[^h517], his mother[^h517] said[^h559], I had wholly[^h6942] dedicated[^h6942] the silver[^h3701] unto the LORD[^h3068] from my hand[^h3027] for my son[^h1121], to make[^h6213] a graven image[^h6459] and a molten image[^h4541]: now therefore I will restore[^h7725] it unto thee.
###### 4
Yet he restored[^h7725] the money[^h3701] unto his mother[^h517]; and his mother[^h517] took[^h3947] two hundred[^h3967] shekels of silver[^h3701], and gave[^h5414] them to the founder[^h6884], who made[^h6213] thereof a graven image[^h6459] and a molten image[^h4541]: and they were in the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4321].
###### 5
And the man[^h376] Micah[^h4318] had an house[^h1004] of gods[^h430], and made[^h6213] an ephod[^h646], and teraphim[^h8655], and consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] one[^h259] of his sons[^h1121], who became his priest[^h3548]. 
###### 6
In those days[^h3117] there was no king[^h4428] in Israel[^h3478], but every man[^h376] did[^h6213] that which was right[^h3477] in his own eyes[^h5869].
###### 7
And there was a young man[^h5288] out of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063] of the family[^h4940] of Judah[^h3063], who was a Levite[^h3881], and he sojourned[^h1481] there.
###### 8
And the man[^h376] departed[^h3212] out of the city[^h5892] from Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063] to sojourn[^h1481] where he could find[^h4672] a place: and he came[^h935] to mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669] to the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318], as he journeyed[^h6213] [^h1870]. 
###### 9
And Micah[^h4318] said[^h559] unto him, Whence[^h370] comest[^h935] thou? And he said[^h559] unto him, I am a Levite[^h3881] of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063], and I go[^h1980] to sojourn[^h1481] where I may find[^h4672] a place.
###### 10
And Micah[^h4318] said[^h559] unto him, Dwell[^h3427] with me, and be unto me a father[^h1] and a priest[^h3548], and I will give[^h5414] thee ten[^h6235] shekels of silver[^h3701] by the year[^h3117], and a suit[^h6187] of apparel[^h899], and thy victuals[^h4241]. So the Levite[^h3881] went in[^h3212]. 
###### 11
And the Levite[^h3881] was content[^h2974] to dwell[^h3427] with the man[^h376]; and the young man[^h5288] was unto him as one[^h259] of his sons[^h1121].
###### 12
And Micah[^h4318] consecrated[^h4390] [^h3027] the Levite[^h3881]; and the young man[^h5288] became his priest[^h3548], and was in the house[^h1004] of Micah[^h4318].
###### 13
Then said[^h559] Micah[^h4318], Now know[^h3045] I that the LORD[^h3068] will do me good[^h3190], seeing I have a Levite[^h3881] to my priest[^h3548].

###### 1
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] again[^h3254] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], when Ehud[^h164] was dead[^h4191].
###### 2
And the LORD[^h3068] sold[^h4376] them into the hand[^h3027] of Jabin[^h2985] king[^h4428] of Canaan[^h3667], that reigned[^h4427] in Hazor[^h2674]; the captain[^h8269] of whose host[^h6635] was Sisera[^h5516], which dwelt[^h3427] in Harosheth[^h2800] of the Gentiles[^h1471].
###### 3
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068]: for he had nine[^h8672] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h7393] of iron[^h1270]; and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] he mightily[^h2394] oppressed[^h3905] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
And Deborah[^h1683], a prophetess[^h5031], the wife[^h802] of Lapidoth[^h3941], she judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] at that time[^h6256].
###### 5
And she dwelt[^h3427] under the palm tree[^h8560] of Deborah[^h1683] between Ramah[^h7414] and Bethel[^h1008] in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came up[^h5927] to her for judgment[^h4941].
###### 6
And she sent[^h7971] and called[^h7121] Barak[^h1301] the son[^h1121] of Abinoam[^h42] out of Kedeshnaphtali[^h6943], and said[^h559] unto him, Hath not the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] commanded[^h6680], saying, Go[^h3212] and draw[^h4900] toward mount[^h2022] Tabor[^h8396], and take[^h3947] with thee ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] of the children[^h1121] of Naphtali[^h5321] and of the children[^h1121] of Zebulun[^h2074]?
###### 7
And I will draw[^h4900] unto thee to the river[^h5158] Kishon[^h7028] Sisera[^h5516], the captain[^h8269] of Jabin's[^h2985] army[^h6635], with his chariots[^h7393] and his multitude[^h1995]; and I will deliver[^h5414] him into thine hand[^h3027].
###### 8
And Barak[^h1301] said[^h559] unto her, If thou wilt go[^h3212] with me, then I will go[^h1980]: but if thou wilt not go[^h3212] with me, then I will not go[^h3212].
###### 9
And she said[^h559], I will surely[^h1980] go[^h3212] with thee: notwithstanding[^h657] the journey[^h1870] that thou takest[^h1980] shall not be for thine honour[^h8597]; for the LORD[^h3068] shall sell[^h4376] Sisera[^h5516] into the hand[^h3027] of a woman[^h802]. And Deborah[^h1683] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] with Barak[^h1301] to Kedesh[^h6943].
###### 10
And Barak[^h1301] called[^h2199] Zebulun[^h2074] and Naphtali[^h5321] to Kedesh[^h6943]; and he went up[^h5927] with ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] at his feet[^h7272]: and Deborah[^h1683] went up[^h5927] with him.
###### 11
Now Heber[^h2268] the Kenite[^h7017], which was of the children[^h1121] of Hobab[^h2246] the father in law[^h2859] of Moses[^h4872], had severed[^h6504] himself from the Kenites[^h7017], and pitched[^h5186] his tent[^h168] unto the plain[^h436] of Zaanaim[^h6815], which is by Kedesh[^h6943].
###### 12
And they shewed[^h5046] Sisera[^h5516] that Barak[^h1301] the son[^h1121] of Abinoam[^h42] was gone up[^h5927] to mount[^h2022] Tabor[^h8396].
###### 13
And Sisera[^h5516] gathered together[^h2199] all his chariots[^h7393], even nine[^h8672] hundred[^h3967] chariots[^h7393] of iron[^h1270], and all the people[^h5971] that were with him, from Harosheth[^h2800] of the Gentiles[^h1471] unto the river[^h5158] of Kishon[^h7028]. 
###### 14
And Deborah[^h1683] said[^h559] unto Barak[^h1301], Up[^h6965]; for this is the day[^h3117] in which the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] Sisera[^h5516] into thine hand[^h3027]: is not the LORD[^h3068] gone out[^h3318] before[^h6440] thee? So Barak[^h1301] went down[^h3381] from mount[^h2022] Tabor[^h8396], and ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] after[^h310] him.
###### 15
And the LORD[^h3068] discomfited[^h2000] Sisera[^h5516], and all his chariots[^h7393], and all his host[^h4264], with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719] before[^h6440] Barak[^h1301]; so that Sisera[^h5516] lighted down[^h3381] off his chariot[^h4818], and fled away[^h5127] on his feet[^h7272].
###### 16
But Barak[^h1301] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] the chariots[^h7393], and after the host[^h4264], unto Harosheth[^h2800] of the Gentiles[^h1471]: and all the host[^h4264] of Sisera[^h5516] fell[^h5307] upon the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; and there was not a man[^h259] left[^h7604]. 
###### 17
Howbeit Sisera[^h5516] fled away[^h5127] on his feet[^h7272] to the tent[^h168] of Jael[^h3278] the wife[^h802] of Heber[^h2268] the Kenite[^h7017]: for there was peace[^h7965] between Jabin[^h2985] the king[^h4428] of Hazor[^h2674] and the house[^h1004] of Heber[^h2268] the Kenite[^h7017].
###### 18
And Jael[^h3278] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] Sisera[^h5516], and said[^h559] unto him, Turn in[^h5493], my lord[^h113], turn in[^h5493] to me; fear[^h3372] not. And when he had turned in[^h5493] unto her into the tent[^h168], she covered[^h3680] him with a mantle[^h8063]. 
###### 19
And he said[^h559] unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little[^h4592] water[^h4325] to drink[^h8248]; for I am thirsty[^h6770]. And she opened[^h6605] a bottle[^h4997] of milk[^h2461], and gave him drink[^h8248], and covered[^h3680] him.
###### 20
Again he said[^h559] unto her, Stand in[^h5975] the door[^h6607] of the tent[^h168], and it shall be, when any man[^h376] doth come[^h935] and enquire[^h7592] of thee, and say[^h559], Is there[^h3426] any man[^h376] here[^h3426]? that thou shalt say[^h559], No.
###### 21
Then Jael[^h3278] Heber's[^h2268] wife[^h802] took[^h3947] a nail[^h3489] of the tent[^h168], and took[^h7760] an hammer[^h4718] in her hand[^h3027], and went[^h935] softly[^h3814] unto him, and smote[^h8628] the nail[^h3489] into his temples[^h7541], and fastened[^h6795] it into the ground[^h776]: for he was fast asleep[^h7290] and weary[^h5774]. So he died[^h4191]. 
###### 22
And, behold, as Barak[^h1301] pursued[^h7291] Sisera[^h5516], Jael[^h3278] came out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him, and said[^h559] unto him, Come[^h3212], and I will shew[^h7200] thee the man[^h376] whom thou seekest[^h1245]. And when he came[^h935] into her tent, behold, Sisera[^h5516] lay[^h5307] dead[^h4191], and the nail[^h3489] was in his temples[^h7541].
###### 23
So God[^h430] subdued[^h3665] on that day[^h3117] Jabin[^h2985] the king[^h4428] of Canaan[^h3667] before[^h6440] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
And the hand[^h3027] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] prospered[^h3212] [^h1980], and prevailed[^h7186] against Jabin[^h2985] the king[^h4428] of Canaan[^h3667], until they had destroyed[^h3772] Jabin[^h2985] king[^h4428] of Canaan[^h3667].

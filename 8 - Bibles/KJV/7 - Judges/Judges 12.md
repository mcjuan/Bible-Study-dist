###### 1
And the men[^h376] of Ephraim[^h669] gathered themselves together[^h6817], and went[^h5674] northward[^h6828], and said[^h559] unto Jephthah[^h3316], Wherefore passedst thou over[^h5674] to fight[^h3898] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and didst not call[^h7121] us to go[^h3212] with thee? we will burn[^h8313] thine house[^h1004] upon thee with fire[^h784]. 
###### 2
And Jephthah[^h3316] said[^h559] unto them, I and my people[^h5971] were[^h1961] at great[^h3966] strife[^h376] [^h7379] with the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]; and when I called[^h2199] you, ye delivered[^h3467] me not out of their hands[^h3027].
###### 3
And when I saw[^h7200] that ye delivered[^h3467] me not, I put[^h7760] my life[^h5315] in my hands[^h3709], and passed over[^h5674] against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] them into my hand[^h3027]: wherefore then are ye come up[^h5927] unto me this day[^h3117], to fight[^h3898] against me?
###### 4
Then Jephthah[^h3316] gathered together[^h6908] all the men[^h582] of Gilead[^h1568], and fought[^h3898] with Ephraim[^h669]: and the men[^h582] of Gilead[^h1568] smote[^h5221] Ephraim[^h669], because they said[^h559], Ye Gileadites[^h1568] are fugitives[^h6412] of Ephraim[^h669] among[^h8432] the Ephraimites[^h669], and among[^h8432] the Manassites[^h4519].
###### 5
And the Gileadites[^h1568] took[^h3920] the passages[^h4569] of Jordan[^h3383] before the Ephraimites[^h669]: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites[^h669] which were escaped[^h6412] said[^h559], Let me go over[^h5674]; that the men[^h582] of Gilead[^h1568] said[^h559] unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite[^h673]? If he said[^h559], Nay;
###### 6
Then said[^h559] they unto him, Say[^h559] now Shibboleth[^h7641]: and he said[^h559] Sibboleth[^h5451]: for he could not frame[^h3559] to pronounce[^h1696] it right[^h3559]. Then they took[^h270] him, and slew[^h7819] him at the passages[^h4569] of Jordan[^h3383]: and there fell[^h5307] at that time[^h6256] of the Ephraimites[^h669] forty[^h705] and two[^h8147] thousand[^h505].
###### 7
And Jephthah[^h3316] judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] six[^h8337] years[^h8141]. Then died[^h4191] Jephthah[^h3316] the Gileadite[^h1569], and was buried[^h6912] in one of the cities[^h5892] of Gilead[^h1568].
###### 8
And after[^h310] him Ibzan[^h78] of Bethlehem[^h1035] judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478].
###### 9
And he had thirty[^h7970] sons[^h1121], and thirty[^h7970] daughters[^h1323], whom he sent[^h7971] abroad[^h2351], and took[^h935] in thirty[^h7970] daughters[^h1323] from abroad[^h2351] for his sons[^h1121]. And he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] seven[^h7651] years[^h8141].
###### 10
Then died[^h4191] Ibzan[^h78], and was buried[^h6912] at Bethlehem[^h1035].
###### 11
And after[^h310] him Elon[^h356], a Zebulonite[^h2075], judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478]; and he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] ten[^h6235] years[^h8141].
###### 12
And Elon[^h356] the Zebulonite[^h2075] died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in Aijalon[^h357] in the country[^h776] of Zebulun[^h2074].
###### 13
And after[^h310] him Abdon[^h5658] the son[^h1121] of Hillel[^h1985], a Pirathonite[^h6553], judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
And he had forty[^h705] sons[^h1121] and thirty[^h7970] nephews[^h1121] [^h1121], that rode[^h7392] on threescore and ten[^h7657] ass colts[^h5895]: and he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] eight[^h8083] years[^h8141]. 
###### 15
And Abdon[^h5658] the son[^h1121] of Hillel[^h1985] the Pirathonite[^h6553] died[^h4191], and was buried[^h6912] in Pirathon[^h6552] in the land[^h776] of Ephraim[^h669], in the mount[^h2022] of the Amalekites[^h6003].

###### 1
Then all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318], and the congregation[^h5712] was gathered together[^h6950] as one[^h259] man[^h376], from Dan[^h1835] even to Beersheba[^h884], with the land[^h776] of Gilead[^h1568], unto the LORD[^h3068] in Mizpeh[^h4709].
###### 2
And the chief[^h6438] of all the people[^h5971], even of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], presented[^h3320] themselves in the assembly[^h6951] of the people[^h5971] of God[^h430], four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h376] [^h7273] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719].
###### 3
(Now the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] heard[^h8085] that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were gone up[^h5927] to Mizpeh[^h4709].) Then said[^h559] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Tell[^h1696] us, how was[^h1961] this wickedness[^h7451]?
###### 4
And the Levite[^h3881] [^h376], the husband[^h376] of the woman[^h802] that was slain[^h7523], answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], I came[^h935] into Gibeah[^h1390] that belongeth to Benjamin[^h1144], I and my concubine[^h6370], to lodge[^h3885]. 
###### 5
And the men[^h1167] of Gibeah[^h1390] rose[^h6965] against me, and beset[^h5437] the house[^h1004] round about[^h5437] upon me by night[^h3915], and thought[^h1819] to have slain[^h2026] me: and my concubine[^h6370] have they forced[^h6031], that she is dead[^h4191]. 
###### 6
And I took[^h270] my concubine[^h6370], and cut her in pieces[^h5408], and sent[^h7971] her throughout all the country[^h7704] of the inheritance[^h5159] of Israel[^h3478]: for they have committed[^h6213] lewdness[^h2154] and folly[^h5039] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
Behold, ye are all children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; give[^h3051] here[^h1988] your advice[^h1697] and counsel[^h6098].
###### 8
And all the people[^h5971] arose[^h6965] as one[^h259] man[^h376], saying[^h559], We will not any[^h376] of us go[^h3212] to his tent[^h168], neither will we any[^h376] of us turn[^h5493] into his house[^h1004].
###### 9
But now this shall be the thing[^h1697] which we will do[^h6213] to Gibeah[^h1390]; we will go up by lot[^h1486] against it;
###### 10
And we will take[^h3947] ten[^h6235] men[^h582] of an hundred[^h3967] throughout all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478], and an hundred[^h3967] of a thousand[^h505], and a thousand[^h505] out of ten thousand[^h7233], to fetch[^h3947] victual[^h6720] for the people[^h5971], that they may do[^h6213], when they come[^h935] to Gibeah[^h1387] of Benjamin[^h1144], according to all the folly[^h5039] that they have wrought[^h6213] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
So all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] were gathered[^h622] against the city[^h5892], knit together[^h2270] as one[^h259] man[^h376]. 
###### 12
And the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] men[^h582] through all the tribe[^h7626] of Benjamin[^h1144], saying[^h559], What wickedness[^h7451] is this that is done[^h1961] among you?
###### 13
Now therefore deliver[^h5414] us the men[^h582], the children[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], which are in Gibeah[^h1390], that we may put them to death[^h4191], and put away[^h1197] evil[^h7451] from Israel[^h3478]. But the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of their brethren[^h251] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 14
But the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] gathered themselves together[^h622] out of the cities[^h5892] unto Gibeah[^h1390], to go out[^h3318] to battle[^h4421] against the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 15
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] were numbered[^h6485] at that time[^h3117] out of the cities[^h5892] twenty[^h6242] and six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719], beside the inhabitants[^h3427] of Gibeah[^h1390], which were numbered[^h6485] seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] chosen[^h977] men[^h376].
###### 16
Among all this people[^h5971] there were seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] chosen[^h977] men[^h376] lefthanded[^h334] [^h3027] [^h3225]; every one could sling[^h7049] stones[^h68] at an hair[^h8185] breadth, and not miss[^h2398].
###### 17
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], beside Benjamin[^h1144], were numbered[^h6485] four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] sword[^h2719]: all these were men[^h376] of war[^h4421].
###### 18
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] arose[^h6965], and went up[^h5927] to the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] [^h1008], and asked[^h7592] counsel of God[^h430], and said[^h559], Which[^h4310] of us shall go up[^h5927] first[^h8462] to the battle[^h4421] against the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Judah[^h3063] shall go up first[^h8462].
###### 19
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] rose up[^h6965] in the morning[^h1242], and encamped[^h2583] against Gibeah[^h1390].
###### 20
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318] to battle[^h4421] against Benjamin[^h1144]; and the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] put themselves in array[^h6186] to fight[^h4421] against them at Gibeah[^h1390].
###### 21
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] came forth[^h3318] out of Gibeah[^h1390], and destroyed down[^h7843] to the ground[^h776] of the Israelites[^h3478] that day[^h3117] twenty[^h6242] and two[^h8147] thousand[^h505] men[^h376].
###### 22
And the people[^h5971] the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] encouraged[^h2388] themselves, and set their battle[^h4421] again[^h3254] in array[^h6186] in the place[^h4725] where they put themselves in array[^h6186] the first[^h7223] day[^h3117].
###### 23
(And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927] and wept[^h1058] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] until even[^h6153], and asked[^h7592] counsel of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Shall I go up[^h5066] again[^h3254] to battle[^h4421] against the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] my brother[^h251]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Go up[^h5927] against him.)
###### 24
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] came near[^h7126] against the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] the second[^h8145] day[^h3117].
###### 25
And Benjamin[^h1144] went forth[^h3318] against[^h7125] them out of Gibeah[^h1390] the second[^h8145] day[^h3117], and destroyed down[^h7843] to the ground[^h776] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] again eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]; all these drew[^h8025] the sword[^h2719].
###### 26
Then all the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and all the people[^h5971], went up[^h5927], and came[^h935] unto the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] [^h1008], and wept[^h1058], and sat[^h3427] there before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and fasted[^h6684] that day[^h3117] until even[^h6153], and offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and peace offerings[^h8002] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 27
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068], (for the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430] was there in those days[^h3117],
###### 28
And Phinehas[^h6372], the son[^h1121] of Eleazar[^h499], the son[^h1121] of Aaron[^h175], stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] it in those days[^h3117],) saying[^h559], Shall I yet again[^h3254] go out[^h3318] to battle[^h4421] against the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] my brother[^h251], or shall I cease[^h2308]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Go up[^h5927]; for to morrow[^h4279] I will deliver[^h5414] them into thine hand[^h3027].
###### 29
And Israel[^h3478] set[^h7760] liers in wait[^h693] round about[^h5439] Gibeah[^h1390].
###### 30
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went up[^h5927] against the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], and put themselves in array[^h6186] against Gibeah[^h1390], as at other times[^h6471].
###### 31
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] the people[^h5971], and were drawn away[^h5423] from the city[^h5892]; and they began[^h2490] to smite[^h5221] of the people[^h5971], and kill[^h2491], as at other times[^h6471], in the highways[^h4546], of which one[^h259] goeth up[^h5927] to the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] [^h1008], and the other[^h259] to Gibeah[^h1390] in the field[^h7704], about thirty[^h7970] men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478].  
###### 32
And the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] said[^h559], They are smitten down[^h5062] before[^h6440] us, as at the first[^h7223]. But the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Let us flee[^h5127], and draw[^h5423] them from the city[^h5892] unto the highways[^h4546].
###### 33
And all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] rose up[^h6965] out of their place[^h4725], and put themselves in array[^h6186] at Baaltamar[^h1193]: and the liers in wait[^h693] of Israel[^h3478] came forth[^h1518] out of their places[^h4725], even out of the meadows[^h4629] of Gibeah[^h1387].
###### 34
And there came[^h935] against[^h5048] Gibeah[^h1390] ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376] out of all Israel[^h3478], and the battle[^h4421] was sore[^h3513]: but they knew[^h3045] not that evil[^h7451] was near[^h5060] them.
###### 35
And the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5062] Benjamin[^h1144] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] destroyed[^h7843] of the Benjamites[^h1145] that day[^h3117] twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] and an hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]: all these drew[^h8025] the sword[^h2719].
###### 36
So the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144] saw[^h7200] that they were smitten[^h5062]: for the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] gave[^h5414] place[^h4725] to the Benjamites[^h1145], because they trusted[^h982] unto the liers in wait[^h693] which they had set[^h7760] beside Gibeah[^h1390].
###### 37
And the liers in wait[^h693] hasted[^h2363], and rushed[^h6584] upon Gibeah[^h1390]; and the liers in wait[^h693] drew themselves along[^h4900], and smote[^h5221] all the city[^h5892] with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]. 
###### 38
Now there was an appointed sign[^h4150] between the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] and[^h5973] the liers in wait[^h693], that they should make a great[^h7235] flame[^h4864] with smoke[^h6227] rise up[^h5927] out of the city[^h5892].   
###### 39
And when the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] retired[^h2015] in the battle[^h4421], Benjamin[^h1144] began[^h2490] to smite[^h5221] and kill[^h2491] of the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] about thirty[^h7970] persons[^h376]: for they said[^h559], Surely[^h5062] they are smitten down[^h5062] before[^h6440] us, as in the first[^h7223] battle[^h4421]. 
###### 40
But when the flame[^h4864] began[^h2490] to arise up[^h5927] out of the city[^h5892] with a pillar[^h5982] of smoke[^h6227], the Benjamites[^h1145] looked[^h6437] behind[^h310] them, and, behold, the flame[^h3632] of the city[^h5892] ascended up[^h5927] to heaven[^h8064]. 
###### 41
And when the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] turned again[^h2015], the men[^h376] of Benjamin[^h1144] were amazed[^h926]: for they saw[^h7200] that evil[^h7451] was come[^h5060] upon them. 
###### 42
Therefore they turned[^h6437] their backs before[^h6440] the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] unto the way[^h1870] of the wilderness[^h4057]; but the battle[^h4421] overtook[^h1692] them; and them which came out of the cities[^h5892] they destroyed[^h7843] in the midst[^h8432] of them.
###### 43
Thus they inclosed[^h3803] the Benjamites[^h1145] round about[^h3803], and chased[^h7291] them, and trode them down[^h1869] with ease[^h4496] over against[^h5227] Gibeah[^h1390] toward the sunrising[^h4217] [^h8121].  
###### 44
And there fell[^h5307] of Benjamin[^h1144] eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]; all these were men[^h582] of valour[^h2428].
###### 45
And they turned[^h6437] and fled[^h5127] toward the wilderness[^h4057] unto the rock[^h5553] of Rimmon[^h7417]: and they gleaned[^h5953] of them in the highways[^h4546] five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] men[^h376]; and pursued[^h1692] hard after[^h310] them unto Gidom[^h1440], and slew[^h5221] two thousand[^h505] men[^h376] of them.
###### 46
So that all which fell[^h5307] that day[^h3117] of Benjamin[^h1144] were twenty[^h6242] and five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] that drew[^h8025] the sword[^h2719]; all these were men[^h582] of valour[^h2428].
###### 47
But six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] turned[^h6437] and fled[^h5127] to the wilderness[^h4057] unto the rock[^h5553] Rimmon[^h7417], and abode[^h3427] in the rock[^h5553] Rimmon[^h7417] four[^h702] months[^h2320].
###### 48
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] turned again[^h7725] upon the children[^h1121] of Benjamin[^h1144], and smote[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], as well the men[^h4974] of every city[^h5892], as[^h5704] the beast[^h929], and all that came to hand[^h4672]: also they set[^h7971] on fire[^h784] all the cities[^h5892] that they came to[^h4672].

###### 1
Now these are the nations[^h1471] which the LORD[^h3068] left[^h3240], to prove[^h5254] Israel[^h3478] by them, even as many of Israel as had not known[^h3045] all the wars[^h4421] of Canaan[^h3667];
###### 2
Only that[^h7535] the generations[^h1755] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] might know[^h3045], to teach[^h3925] them war[^h4421], at the least such as before[^h6440] knew[^h3045] nothing thereof;
###### 3
Namely, five[^h2568] lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430], and all the Canaanites[^h3669], and the Sidonians[^h6722], and the Hivites[^h2340] that dwelt[^h3427] in mount[^h2022] Lebanon[^h3844], from mount[^h2022] Baalhermon[^h1179] unto the entering in[^h935] of Hamath[^h2574].
###### 4
And they were to prove[^h5254] Israel[^h3478] by them, to know[^h3045] whether they would hearken[^h8085] unto the commandments[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068], which he commanded[^h6680] their fathers[^h1] by the hand[^h3027] of Moses[^h4872].
###### 5
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] among[^h7130] the Canaanites[^h3669], Hittites[^h2850], and Amorites[^h567], and Perizzites[^h6522], and Hivites[^h2340], and Jebusites[^h2983]:
###### 6
And they took[^h3947] their daughters[^h1323] to be their wives[^h802], and gave[^h5414] their daughters[^h1323] to their sons[^h1121], and served[^h5647] their gods[^h430].
###### 7
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and forgat[^h7911] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], and served[^h5647] Baalim[^h1168] and the groves[^h842].
###### 8
Therefore the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] was hot[^h2734] against Israel[^h3478], and he sold[^h4376] them into the hand[^h3027] of Chushanrishathaim[^h3573] king[^h4428] of Mesopotamia[^h763]: and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] served[^h5647] Chushanrishathaim[^h3573] eight[^h8083] years[^h8141]. 
###### 9
And when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068], the LORD[^h3068] raised up[^h6965] a deliverer[^h3467] to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], who delivered[^h3467] them, even Othniel[^h6274] the son[^h1121] of Kenaz[^h7073], Caleb's[^h3612] younger[^h6996] brother[^h251]. 
###### 10
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came upon him, and he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478], and went out[^h3318] to war[^h4421]: and the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] Chushanrishathaim[^h3573] king[^h4428] of Mesopotamia[^h763] into his hand[^h3027]; and his hand[^h3027] prevailed[^h5810] against Chushanrishathaim[^h3573].  
###### 11
And the land[^h776] had rest[^h8252] forty[^h705] years[^h8141]. And Othniel[^h6274] the son[^h1121] of Kenaz[^h7073] died[^h4191].
###### 12
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did[^h6213] evil[^h7451] again[^h3254] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068]: and the LORD[^h3068] strengthened[^h2388] Eglon[^h5700] the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] against Israel[^h3478], because they had done[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And he gathered[^h622] unto him the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] and Amalek[^h6002], and went[^h3212] and smote[^h5221] Israel[^h3478], and possessed[^h3423] the city[^h5892] of palm trees[^h8558] [^h5899].
###### 14
So the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] served[^h5647] Eglon[^h5700] the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124] eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] years[^h8141].
###### 15
But when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068], the LORD[^h3068] raised them up[^h6965] a deliverer[^h3467], Ehud[^h164] the son[^h1121] of Gera[^h1617], a Benjamite[^h1145], a man[^h376] lefthanded[^h334] [^h3225]: and by him[^h3027] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] sent[^h7971] a present[^h4503] unto Eglon[^h5700] the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124].  
###### 16
But Ehud[^h164] made[^h6213] him a dagger[^h2719] which had two[^h8147] edges[^h6366], of a cubit[^h1574] length[^h753]; and he did gird[^h2296] it under his raiment[^h4055] upon his right[^h3225] thigh[^h3409].
###### 17
And he brought[^h7126] the present[^h4503] unto Eglon[^h5700] king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124]: and Eglon[^h5700] was a very[^h3966] fat[^h1277] man[^h376].
###### 18
And when he had made an end[^h3615] to offer[^h7126] the present[^h4503], he sent away[^h7971] the people[^h5971] that bare[^h5375] the present[^h4503].
###### 19
But he himself turned again[^h7725] from the quarries[^h6456] that were by Gilgal[^h1537], and said[^h559], I have a secret[^h5643] errand[^h1697] unto thee, O king[^h4428]: who said[^h559], Keep silence[^h2013]. And all that stood[^h5975] by him went out[^h3318] from him. 
###### 20
And Ehud[^h164] came[^h935] unto him; and he was sitting[^h3427] in a summer[^h4747] parlour[^h5944], which he had for himself alone. And Ehud[^h164] said[^h559], I have a message[^h1697] from God[^h430] unto thee. And he arose[^h6965] out of his seat[^h3678]. 
###### 21
And Ehud[^h164] put forth[^h7971] his left[^h8040] hand[^h3027], and took[^h3947] the dagger[^h2719] from his right[^h3225] thigh[^h3409], and thrust[^h8628] it into his belly[^h990]:
###### 22
And the haft[^h5325] also went in[^h935] after[^h310] the blade[^h3851]; and the fat[^h2459] closed[^h5462] upon[^h1157] the blade[^h3851], so that he could not draw[^h8025] the dagger[^h2719] out of his belly[^h990]; and the dirt[^h6574] came out[^h3318]. 
###### 23
Then Ehud[^h164] went forth[^h3318] through the porch[^h4528], and shut[^h5462] the doors[^h1817] of the parlour[^h5944] upon him, and locked[^h5274] them.
###### 24
When he was gone out[^h3318], his servants[^h5650] came[^h935]; and when they saw[^h7200] that, behold, the doors[^h1817] of the parlour[^h5944] were locked[^h5274], they said[^h559], Surely he covereth[^h5526] his feet[^h7272] in his summer[^h4747] chamber[^h2315]. 
###### 25
And they tarried[^h2342] till they were ashamed[^h954]: and, behold, he opened[^h6605] not the doors[^h1817] of the parlour[^h5944]; therefore they took[^h3947] a key[^h4668], and opened[^h6605] them: and, behold, their lord[^h113] was fallen down[^h5307] dead[^h4191] on the earth[^h776].
###### 26
And Ehud[^h164] escaped[^h4422] while they tarried[^h4102], and passed beyond[^h5674] the quarries[^h6456], and escaped[^h4422] unto Seirath[^h8167].
###### 27
And it came to pass, when he was come[^h935], that he blew[^h8628] a trumpet[^h7782] in the mountain[^h2022] of Ephraim[^h669], and the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went down[^h3381] with him from the mount[^h2022], and he before[^h6440] them.
###### 28
And he said[^h559] unto them, Follow[^h7291] after[^h310] me: for the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] your enemies[^h341] the Moabites[^h4124] into your hand[^h3027]. And they went down[^h3381] after[^h310] him, and took[^h3920] the fords[^h4569] of Jordan[^h3383] toward Moab[^h4124], and suffered[^h5414] not a man[^h376] to pass over[^h5674].
###### 29
And they slew[^h5221] of Moab[^h4124] at that time[^h6256] about ten[^h6235] thousand[^h505] men[^h376], all lusty[^h8082], and all men[^h376] of valour[^h2428]; and there escaped[^h4422] not a man[^h376]. 
###### 30
So Moab[^h4124] was subdued[^h3665] that day[^h3117] under the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478]. And the land[^h776] had rest[^h8252] fourscore[^h8084] years[^h8141].
###### 31
And after[^h310] him was Shamgar[^h8044] the son[^h1121] of Anath[^h6067], which slew[^h5221] of the Philistines[^h6430] six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] with an ox[^h1241] goad[^h4451]: and he also delivered[^h3467] Israel[^h3478].

###### 1
But it came to pass within a while after[^h3117], in the time[^h3117] of wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105], that Samson[^h8123] visited[^h6485] his wife[^h802] with a kid[^h1423] [^h5795]; and he said[^h559], I will go in[^h935] to my wife[^h802] into the chamber[^h2315]. But her father[^h1] would not suffer[^h5414] him to go in[^h935].
###### 2
And her father[^h1] said[^h559], I verily[^h559] thought[^h559] that thou hadst utterly[^h8130] hated[^h8130] her; therefore I gave[^h5414] her to thy companion[^h4828]: is not her younger[^h6996] sister[^h269] fairer[^h2896] than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. 
###### 3
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] concerning them, Now[^h6471] shall I be more blameless[^h5352] than the Philistines[^h6430], though I do[^h6213] them a displeasure[^h7451]. 
###### 4
And Samson[^h8123] went[^h3212] and caught[^h3920] three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] foxes[^h7776], and took[^h3947] firebrands[^h3940], and turned[^h6437] tail[^h2180] to tail[^h2180], and put[^h7760] a[^h259] firebrand[^h3940] in the midst[^h8432] between two[^h8147] tails[^h2180]. 
###### 5
And when he had set[^h1197] the brands[^h3940] on fire[^h784], he let them go[^h7971] into the standing corn[^h7054] of the Philistines[^h6430], and burnt up[^h1197] both the shocks[^h1430], and also the standing corn[^h7054], with the vineyards[^h3754] and olives[^h2132].
###### 6
Then the Philistines[^h6430] said[^h559], Who hath done[^h6213] this? And they answered[^h559], Samson[^h8123], the son in law[^h2860] of the Timnite[^h8554], because he had taken[^h3947] his wife[^h802], and given[^h5414] her to his companion[^h4828]. And the Philistines[^h6430] came up[^h5927], and burnt[^h8313] her and her father[^h1] with fire[^h784].
###### 7
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto them, Though[^h518] ye have done[^h6213] this[^h2063], yet will I be avenged[^h5358] of you, and after[^h310] that I will cease[^h2308].
###### 8
And he smote[^h5221] them hip[^h7785] and[^h5921] thigh[^h3409] with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]: and he went down[^h3381] and dwelt[^h3427] in the top[^h5585] of the rock[^h5553] Etam[^h5862].
###### 9
Then the Philistines[^h6430] went up[^h5927], and pitched[^h2583] in Judah[^h3063], and spread[^h5203] themselves in Lehi[^h3896].
###### 10
And the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] said[^h559], Why are ye come up[^h5927] against us? And they answered[^h559], To bind[^h631] Samson[^h8123] are we come up[^h5927], to do[^h6213] to him as he hath done[^h6213] to us.
###### 11
Then three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] went[^h3381] to the top[^h5585] of the rock[^h5553] Etam[^h5862], and said[^h559] to Samson[^h8123], Knowest[^h3045] thou not that the Philistines[^h6430] are rulers[^h4910] over us? what is this that thou hast done[^h6213] unto us? And he said[^h559] unto them, As they did[^h6213] unto me, so have I done[^h6213] unto them. 
###### 12
And they said[^h559] unto him, We are come down[^h3381] to bind[^h631] thee, that we may deliver[^h5414] thee into the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430]. And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559] unto them, Swear[^h7650] unto me, that ye will not fall upon[^h6293] me yourselves.
###### 13
And they spake[^h559] unto him, saying[^h559], No; but we will bind[^h631] thee fast[^h631], and deliver[^h5414] thee into their hand[^h3027]: but surely[^h4191] we will not kill[^h4191] thee. And they bound[^h631] him with two[^h8147] new[^h2319] cords[^h5688], and brought him up[^h5927] from the rock[^h5553].
###### 14
And when he came[^h935] unto Lehi[^h3896], the Philistines[^h6430] shouted[^h7321] against[^h7125] him: and the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came mightily[^h6743] upon him, and the cords[^h5688] that were upon his arms[^h2220] became as flax[^h6593] that was burnt[^h1197] with fire[^h784], and his bands[^h612] loosed[^h4549] from off his hands[^h3027]. 
###### 15
And he found[^h4672] a new[^h2961] jawbone[^h3895] of an ass[^h2543], and put forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027], and took[^h3947] it, and slew[^h5221] a thousand[^h505] men[^h376] therewith. 
###### 16
And Samson[^h8123] said[^h559], With the jawbone[^h3895] of an ass[^h2543], heaps[^h2565] upon heaps[^h2565], with the jaw[^h3895] of an ass[^h2543] have I slain[^h5221] a thousand[^h505] men[^h376]. 
###### 17
And it came to pass, when he had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696], that he cast away[^h7993] the jawbone[^h3895] out of his hand[^h3027], and called[^h7121] that place[^h4725] Ramathlehi[^h7437]. 
###### 18
And he was sore[^h3966] athirst[^h6770], and called[^h7121] on the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], Thou hast given[^h5414] this great[^h1419] deliverance[^h8668] into the hand[^h3027] of thy servant[^h5650]: and now shall I die[^h4191] for thirst[^h6772], and fall[^h5307] into the hand[^h3027] of the uncircumcised[^h6189]?
###### 19
But God[^h430] clave[^h1234] an hollow place[^h4388] that was in the jaw[^h3895], and there came[^h3318] water[^h4325] thereout; and when he had drunk[^h8354], his spirit[^h7307] came again[^h7725], and he revived[^h2421]: wherefore he called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] thereof Enhakkore[^h5875], which is in Lehi[^h3896] unto this day[^h3117].  
###### 20
And he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] in the days[^h3117] of the Philistines[^h6430] twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141].

###### 1
Better[^h2896] is the poor[^h7326] that walketh[^h1980] in his integrity[^h8537], than he that is perverse[^h6141] in his lips[^h8193], and is a fool[^h3684].
###### 2
Also, that the soul[^h5315] be without knowledge[^h1847], it is not good[^h2896]; and he that hasteth[^h213] with his feet[^h7272] sinneth[^h2398].
###### 3
The foolishness[^h200] of man[^h120] perverteth[^h5557] his way[^h1870]: and his heart[^h3820] fretteth[^h2196] against the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
Wealth[^h1952] maketh[^h3254] many[^h7227] friends[^h7453]; but the poor[^h1800] is separated[^h6504] from his neighbour[^h7453].
###### 5
A false[^h8267] witness[^h5707] shall not be unpunished[^h5352], and he that speaketh[^h6315] lies[^h3577] shall not escape[^h4422]. 
###### 6
Many[^h7227] will intreat[^h2470] the favour[^h6440] of the prince[^h5081]: and every man is a friend[^h7453] to him[^h376] that giveth gifts[^h4976]. 
###### 7
All the brethren[^h251] of the poor[^h7326] do hate[^h8130] him: how much more do his friends[^h4828] go far[^h7368] from him? he pursueth[^h7291] them with words[^h561], yet they are wanting to him.
###### 8
He that getteth[^h7069] wisdom[^h3820] loveth[^h157] his own soul[^h5315]: he that keepeth[^h8104] understanding[^h8394] shall find[^h4672] good[^h2896]. 
###### 9
A false[^h8267] witness[^h5707] shall not be unpunished[^h5352], and he that speaketh[^h6315] lies[^h3577] shall perish[^h6].
###### 10
Delight[^h8588] is not seemly[^h5000] for a fool[^h3684]; much less for a servant[^h5650] to have rule[^h4910] over princes[^h8269].
###### 11
The discretion[^h7922] of a man[^h120] deferreth[^h748] his anger[^h639]; and it is his glory[^h8597] to pass over[^h5674] a transgression[^h6588]. 
###### 12
The king's[^h4428] wrath[^h2197] is as the roaring[^h5099] of a lion[^h3715]; but his favour[^h7522] is as dew[^h2919] upon the grass[^h6212].
###### 13
A foolish[^h3684] son[^h1121] is the calamity[^h1942] of his father[^h1]: and the contentions[^h4079] of a wife[^h802] are a continual[^h2956] dropping[^h1812].
###### 14
House[^h1004] and riches[^h1952] are the inheritance[^h5159] of fathers[^h1]: and a prudent[^h7919] wife[^h802] is from the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
Slothfulness[^h6103] casteth[^h5307] into a deep sleep[^h8639]; and an idle[^h7423] soul[^h5315] shall suffer hunger[^h7456].
###### 16
He that keepeth[^h8104] the commandment[^h4687] keepeth[^h8104] his own soul[^h5315]; but he that despiseth[^h959] his ways[^h1870] shall die[^h4191].
###### 17
He that hath pity[^h2603] upon the poor[^h1800] lendeth[^h3867] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and that which he hath given[^h1576] will he pay him again[^h7999]. 
###### 18
Chasten[^h3256] thy son[^h1121] while there is[^h3426] hope[^h8615], and let not thy soul[^h5315] spare[^h5375] for his crying[^h4191]. 
###### 19
A man[^h1419] of great[^h1632] wrath[^h2534] shall suffer[^h5375] punishment[^h6066]: for if thou deliver[^h5337] him, yet thou must do it again[^h3254]. 
###### 20
Hear[^h8085] counsel[^h6098], and receive[^h6901] instruction[^h4148], that thou mayest be wise[^h2449] in thy latter end[^h319].
###### 21
There are many[^h7227] devices[^h4284] in a man's[^h376] heart[^h3820]; nevertheless the counsel[^h6098] of the LORD[^h3068], that shall stand[^h6965].
###### 22
The desire[^h8378] of a man[^h120] is his kindness[^h2617]: and a poor man[^h7326] is better[^h2896] than[^h376] a liar[^h3577].
###### 23
The fear[^h3374] of the LORD[^h3068] tendeth to life[^h2416]: and he that hath it shall abide[^h3885] satisfied[^h7649]; he shall not be visited[^h6485] with evil[^h7451].
###### 24
A slothful[^h6102] man hideth[^h2934] his hand[^h3027] in his bosom[^h6747], and will not so much as bring[^h7725] it to his mouth[^h6310] again[^h7725].
###### 25
Smite[^h5221] a scorner[^h3887], and the simple[^h6612] will beware[^h6191]: and reprove[^h3198] one that hath understanding[^h995], and he will understand[^h995] knowledge[^h1847]. 
###### 26
He that wasteth[^h7703] his father[^h1], and chaseth away[^h1272] his mother[^h517], is a son[^h1121] that causeth shame[^h954], and bringeth reproach[^h2659].
###### 27
Cease[^h2308], my son[^h1121], to hear[^h8085] the instruction[^h4148] that causeth to err[^h7686] from the words[^h561] of knowledge[^h1847].
###### 28
An ungodly[^h1100] witness[^h5707] scorneth[^h3887] judgment[^h4941]: and the mouth[^h6310] of the wicked[^h7563] devoureth[^h1104] iniquity[^h205]. 
###### 29
Judgments[^h8201] are prepared[^h3559] for scorners[^h3887], and stripes[^h4112] for the back[^h1460] of fools[^h3684].

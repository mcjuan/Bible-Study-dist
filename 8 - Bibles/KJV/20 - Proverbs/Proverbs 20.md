###### 1
Wine[^h3196] is a mocker[^h3887], strong drink[^h7941] is raging[^h1993]: and whosoever is deceived[^h7686] thereby is not wise[^h2449].
###### 2
The fear[^h367] of a king[^h4428] is as the roaring[^h5099] of a lion[^h3715]: whoso provoketh him to anger[^h5674] sinneth[^h2398] against his own soul[^h5315].
###### 3
It is an honour[^h3519] for a man[^h376] to cease[^h7674] from strife[^h7379]: but every fool[^h191] will be meddling[^h1566].
###### 4
The sluggard[^h6102] will not plow[^h2790] by reason of the cold[^h2779]; therefore shall he beg[^h7592] [^h7592] in harvest[^h7105], and have nothing. 
###### 5
Counsel[^h6098] in the heart[^h3820] of man[^h376] is like deep[^h6013] water[^h4325]; but a man[^h376] of understanding[^h8394] will draw it out[^h1802].
###### 6
Most[^h7230] men[^h120] will proclaim[^h7121] every one[^h376] his own goodness[^h2617]: but a faithful[^h529] man[^h376] who can find[^h4672]? 
###### 7
The just[^h6662] man walketh[^h1980] in his integrity[^h8537]: his children[^h1121] are blessed[^h835] after[^h310] him.
###### 8
A king[^h4428] that sitteth in[^h3427] the throne[^h3678] of judgment[^h1779] scattereth away[^h2219] all evil[^h7451] with his eyes[^h5869].
###### 9
Who can say[^h559], I have made my heart[^h3820] clean[^h2135], I am pure[^h2891] from my sin[^h2403]?
###### 10
Divers weights[^h68] [^h68], and divers measures[^h374] [^h374], both[^h8147] of them are alike[^h1571] abomination[^h8441] to the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 11
Even a child[^h5288] is known[^h5234] by his doings[^h4611], whether his work[^h6467] be pure[^h2134], and whether it be right[^h3477].
###### 12
The hearing[^h8085] ear[^h241], and the seeing[^h7200] eye[^h5869], the LORD[^h3068] hath made[^h6213] even both[^h8147] of them.
###### 13
Love[^h157] not sleep[^h8142], lest thou come to poverty[^h3423]; open[^h6491] thine eyes[^h5869], and thou shalt be satisfied[^h7646] with bread[^h3899].
###### 14
It is naught[^h7451], it is naught[^h7451], saith[^h559] the buyer[^h7069]: but when he is gone[^h235] his way, then he boasteth[^h1984].
###### 15
There is[^h3426] gold[^h2091], and a multitude[^h7230] of rubies[^h6443]: but the lips[^h8193] of knowledge[^h1847] are a precious[^h3366] jewel[^h3627].
###### 16
Take[^h3947] his garment[^h899] that is surety[^h6148] for a stranger[^h2114]: and take a pledge[^h2254] of him for a strange woman[^h5237].
###### 17
Bread[^h3899] of deceit[^h8267] is sweet[^h6156] to a man[^h376]; but afterwards[^h310] his mouth[^h6310] shall be filled[^h4390] with gravel[^h2687]. 
###### 18
Every purpose[^h4284] is established[^h3559] by counsel[^h6098]: and with good advice[^h8458] make[^h6213] war[^h4421].
###### 19
He that goeth about[^h1980] as a talebearer[^h7400] revealeth[^h1540] secrets[^h5475]: therefore meddle[^h6148] not with him that flattereth[^h6601] with his lips[^h8193]. 
###### 20
Whoso curseth[^h7043] his father[^h1] or his mother[^h517], his lamp[^h5216] shall be put out[^h1846] in obscure[^h380] [^h380] darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 21
An inheritance[^h5159] may be gotten hastily[^h926] [^h973] at the beginning[^h7223]; but the end[^h319] thereof shall not be blessed[^h1288].
###### 22
Say[^h559] not thou, I will recompense[^h7999] evil[^h7451]; but wait on[^h6960] the LORD[^h3068], and he shall save[^h3467] thee.
###### 23
Divers weights[^h68] [^h68] are an abomination[^h8441] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and a false[^h4820] balance[^h3976] is not good[^h2896]. 
###### 24
Man's[^h1397] goings[^h4703] are of the LORD[^h3068]; how can a man[^h120] then understand[^h995] his own way[^h1870]?
###### 25
It is a snare[^h4170] to the man[^h120] who devoureth[^h3216] that which is holy[^h6944], and after[^h310] vows[^h5088] to make enquiry[^h1239].
###### 26
A wise[^h2450] king[^h4428] scattereth[^h2219] the wicked[^h7563], and bringeth[^h7725] the wheel[^h212] over them.
###### 27
The spirit[^h5397] of man[^h120] is the candle[^h5216] of the LORD[^h3068], searching[^h2664] all the inward parts[^h2315] of the belly[^h990]. 
###### 28
Mercy[^h2617] and truth[^h571] preserve[^h5341] the king[^h4428]: and his throne[^h3678] is upholden[^h5582] by mercy[^h2617].
###### 29
The glory[^h8597] of young men[^h970] is their strength[^h3581]: and the beauty[^h1926] of old men[^h2205] is the gray head[^h7872].
###### 30
The blueness[^h2250] of a wound[^h6482] cleanseth[^h8562] away evil[^h7451]: so do stripes[^h4347] the inward parts[^h2315] of the belly[^h990].

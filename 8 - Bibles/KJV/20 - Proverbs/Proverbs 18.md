###### 1
Through desire[^h8378] a man, having separated[^h6504] himself, seeketh[^h1245] and intermeddleth[^h1566] with all wisdom[^h8454]. 
###### 2
A fool[^h3684] hath no delight[^h2654] in understanding[^h8394], but that his heart[^h3820] may discover[^h1540] itself.
###### 3
When the wicked[^h7563] cometh[^h935], then cometh[^h935] also contempt[^h937], and with ignominy[^h7036] reproach[^h2781].
###### 4
The words[^h1697] of a man's[^h376] mouth[^h6310] are as deep[^h6013] waters[^h4325], and the wellspring[^h4726] of wisdom[^h2451] as a flowing[^h5042] brook[^h5158].
###### 5
It is not good[^h2896] to accept[^h5375] the person[^h6440] of the wicked[^h7563], to overthrow[^h5186] the righteous[^h6662] in judgment[^h4941].
###### 6
A fool's[^h3684] lips[^h8193] enter[^h935] into contention[^h7379], and his mouth[^h6310] calleth[^h7121] for strokes[^h4112].
###### 7
A fool's[^h3684] mouth[^h6310] is his destruction[^h4288], and his lips[^h8193] are the snare[^h4170] of his soul[^h5315].
###### 8
The words[^h1697] of a talebearer[^h5372] are as wounds[^h3859], and they go down[^h3381] into the innermost parts[^h2315] of the belly[^h990].   
###### 9
He also that is slothful[^h7503] in his work[^h4399] is brother[^h251] to him that is a great[^h1167] waster[^h7843].
###### 10
The name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] is a strong[^h5797] tower[^h4026]: the righteous[^h6662] runneth[^h7323] into it, and is safe[^h7682]. 
###### 11
The rich man's[^h6223] wealth[^h1952] is his strong[^h5797] city[^h7151], and as an high[^h7682] wall[^h2346] in his own conceit[^h4906].
###### 12
Before[^h6440] destruction[^h7667] the heart[^h3820] of man[^h376] is haughty[^h1361], and before[^h6440] honour[^h3519] is humility[^h6038].
###### 13
He that answereth[^h7725] a matter[^h1697] before he heareth[^h8085] it, it is folly[^h200] and shame[^h3639] unto him. 
###### 14
The spirit[^h7307] of a man[^h376] will sustain[^h3557] his infirmity[^h4245]; but a wounded[^h5218] spirit[^h7307] who can bear[^h5375]?
###### 15
The heart[^h3820] of the prudent[^h995] getteth[^h7069] knowledge[^h1847]; and the ear[^h241] of the wise[^h2450] seeketh[^h1245] knowledge[^h1847].
###### 16
A man's[^h120] gift[^h4976] maketh room[^h7337] for him, and bringeth[^h5148] him before[^h6440] great men[^h1419].
###### 17
He that is first[^h7223] in his own cause[^h7379] seemeth just[^h6662]; but his neighbour[^h7453] cometh[^h935] [^h935] and searcheth[^h2713] him.
###### 18
The lot[^h1486] causeth contentions[^h4079] to cease[^h7673], and parteth[^h6504] between the mighty[^h6099].
###### 19
A brother[^h251] offended[^h6586] is harder to be won than a strong[^h5797] city[^h7151]: and their contentions[^h4079] [^h4066] are like the bars[^h1280] of a castle[^h759].
###### 20
A man's[^h376] belly[^h990] shall be satisfied[^h7646] with the fruit[^h6529] of his mouth[^h6310]; and with the increase[^h8393] of his lips[^h8193] shall he be filled[^h7646].
###### 21
Death[^h4194] and life[^h2416] are in the power[^h3027] of the tongue[^h3956]: and they that love[^h157] it shall eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] thereof.
###### 22
Whoso findeth[^h4672] a wife[^h802] findeth[^h4672] a good[^h2896] thing, and obtaineth[^h6329] favour[^h7522] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
The poor[^h7326] useth[^h1696] intreaties[^h8469]; but the rich[^h6223] answereth[^h6030] roughly[^h5794].
###### 24
A man[^h376] that hath friends[^h7453] must shew himself friendly[^h7489]: and there is[^h3426] a friend[^h157] that sticketh closer[^h1695] than a brother[^h251].

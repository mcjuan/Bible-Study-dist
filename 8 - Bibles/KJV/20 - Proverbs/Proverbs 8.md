###### 1
Doth not wisdom[^h2451] cry[^h7121]? and understanding[^h8394] put forth[^h5414] her voice[^h6963]?
###### 2
She standeth[^h5324] in the top[^h7218] of high places[^h4791], by the way[^h1870] in the places[^h1004] of the paths[^h5410].
###### 3
She crieth[^h7442] at[^h3027] the gates[^h8179], at the entry[^h6310] of the city[^h7176], at the coming[^h3996] in at the doors[^h6607].
###### 4
Unto you, O men[^h376], I call[^h7121]; and my voice[^h6963] is to the sons[^h1121] of man[^h120].
###### 5
O ye simple[^h6612], understand[^h995] wisdom[^h6195]: and, ye fools[^h3684], be ye of an understanding[^h995] heart[^h3820].
###### 6
Hear[^h8085]; for I will speak[^h1696] of excellent things[^h5057]; and the opening[^h4669] of my lips[^h8193] shall be right things[^h4339].
###### 7
For my mouth[^h2441] shall speak[^h1897] truth[^h571]; and wickedness[^h7562] is an abomination[^h8441] to my lips[^h8193]. 
###### 8
All the words[^h561] of my mouth[^h6310] are in righteousness[^h6664]; there is nothing froward[^h6617] or perverse[^h6141] in them. 
###### 9
They are all plain[^h5228] to him that understandeth[^h995], and right[^h3477] to them that find[^h4672] knowledge[^h1847].
###### 10
Receive[^h3947] my instruction[^h4148], and not silver[^h3701]; and knowledge[^h1847] rather than choice[^h977] gold[^h2742].
###### 11
For wisdom[^h2451] is better[^h2896] than rubies[^h6443]; and all the things that may be desired[^h2656] are not to be compared[^h7737] to it.
###### 12
I wisdom[^h2451] dwell[^h7931] with prudence[^h6195], and find out[^h4672] knowledge[^h1847] of witty inventions[^h4209]. 
###### 13
The fear[^h3374] of the LORD[^h3068] is to hate[^h8130] evil[^h7451]: pride[^h1344], and arrogancy[^h1347], and the evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], and the froward[^h8419] mouth[^h6310], do I hate[^h8130].
###### 14
Counsel[^h6098] is mine, and sound wisdom[^h8454]: I am understanding[^h998]; I have strength[^h1369].
###### 15
By me kings[^h4428] reign[^h4427], and princes[^h7336] decree[^h2710] justice[^h6664].
###### 16
By me princes[^h8269] rule[^h8323], and nobles[^h5081], even all the judges[^h8199] of the earth[^h776].
###### 17
I love[^h157] them that love[^h157] me; and those that seek me early[^h7836] shall find[^h4672] me.
###### 18
Riches[^h6239] and honour[^h3519] are with me; yea, durable[^h6276] riches[^h1952] and righteousness[^h6666].
###### 19
My fruit[^h6529] is better[^h2896] than gold[^h2742], yea, than fine gold[^h6337]; and my revenue[^h8393] than choice[^h977] silver[^h3701].
###### 20
I lead[^h1980] in the way[^h734] of righteousness[^h6666], in the midst[^h8432] of the paths[^h5410] of judgment[^h4941]: 
###### 21
That I may cause those that love[^h157] me to inherit[^h5157] substance[^h3426]; and I will fill[^h4390] their treasures[^h214].
###### 22
The LORD[^h3068] possessed[^h7069] me in the beginning[^h7225] of his way[^h1870], before[^h6924] his works[^h4659] of old.
###### 23
I was set up[^h5258] from everlasting[^h5769], from the beginning[^h7218], or ever[^h6924] the earth[^h776] was.
###### 24
When there were no depths[^h8415], I was brought forth[^h2342]; when there were no fountains[^h4599] abounding[^h3513] with water[^h4325].
###### 25
Before the mountains[^h2022] were settled[^h2883], before[^h6440] the hills[^h1389] was I brought forth[^h2342]:
###### 26
While as yet he had not made[^h6213] the earth[^h776], nor the fields[^h2351], nor the highest part[^h7218] of the dust[^h6083] of the world[^h8398].  
###### 27
When he prepared[^h3559] the heavens[^h8064], I was there: when he set[^h2710] a compass[^h2329] upon the face[^h6440] of the depth[^h8415]: 
###### 28
When he established[^h553] the clouds[^h7834] above[^h4605]: when he strengthened[^h5810] the fountains[^h5869] of the deep[^h8415]:
###### 29
When he gave[^h7760] to the sea[^h3220] his decree[^h2706], that the waters[^h4325] should not pass[^h5674] his commandment[^h6310]: when he appointed[^h2710] the foundations[^h4144] of the earth[^h776]:
###### 30
Then I was by him[^h681], as one brought up[^h525] with him: and I was daily[^h3117] [^h3117] his delight[^h8191], rejoicing[^h7832] always[^h6256] before[^h6440] him;
###### 31
Rejoicing[^h7832] in the habitable part[^h8398] of his earth[^h776]; and my delights[^h8191] were with the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120].
###### 32
Now therefore hearken[^h8085] unto me, O ye children[^h1121]: for blessed[^h835] are they that keep[^h8104] my ways[^h1870].
###### 33
Hear[^h8085] instruction[^h4148], and be wise[^h2449], and refuse[^h6544] it not.
###### 34
Blessed[^h835] is the man[^h120] that heareth[^h8085] me, watching[^h8245] daily[^h3117] [^h3117] at my gates[^h1817], waiting[^h8104] at the posts[^h4201] of my doors[^h6607].
###### 35
For whoso findeth[^h4672] me findeth[^h4672] [^h4672] life[^h2416], and shall obtain[^h6329] favour[^h7522] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 36
But he that sinneth[^h2398] against me wrongeth[^h2554] his own soul[^h5315]: all they that hate[^h8130] me love[^h157] death[^h4194].

###### 1
The wicked[^h7563] flee[^h5127] when no man pursueth[^h7291]: but the righteous[^h6662] are bold[^h982] as a lion[^h3715].
###### 2
For the transgression[^h6588] of a land[^h776] many[^h7227] are the princes[^h8269] thereof: but by a man[^h120] of understanding[^h995] and knowledge[^h3045] the state[^h3651] thereof shall be prolonged[^h748]. 
###### 3
A poor[^h7326] man[^h1397] that oppresseth[^h6231] the poor[^h1800] is like a sweeping[^h5502] rain[^h4306] which leaveth no food[^h3899]. 
###### 4
They that forsake[^h5800] the law[^h8451] praise[^h1984] the wicked[^h7563]: but such as keep[^h8104] the law[^h8451] contend[^h1624] with them.
###### 5
Evil[^h7451] men[^h582] understand[^h995] not judgment[^h4941]: but they that seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068] understand[^h995] all things.
###### 6
Better[^h2896] is the poor[^h7326] that walketh[^h1980] in his uprightness[^h8537], than he that is perverse[^h6141] in his ways[^h1870], though he be rich[^h6223].
###### 7
Whoso keepeth[^h5341] the law[^h8451] is a wise[^h995] son[^h1121]: but he that is a companion[^h7462] of riotous[^h2151] men shameth[^h3637] his father[^h1]. 
###### 8
He that by usury[^h5392] and unjust gain[^h8636] increaseth[^h7235] his substance[^h1952], he shall gather[^h6908] it for him that will pity[^h2603] the poor[^h1800]. 
###### 9
He that turneth away[^h5493] his ear[^h241] from hearing[^h8085] the law[^h8451], even his prayer[^h8605] shall be abomination[^h8441].
###### 10
Whoso causeth the righteous[^h3477] to go astray[^h7686] in an evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], he shall fall[^h5307] himself into his own pit[^h7816]: but the upright[^h8549] shall have good[^h2896] things in possession[^h5157].
###### 11
The rich[^h6223] man[^h376] is wise[^h2450] in his own conceit[^h5869]; but the poor[^h1800] that hath understanding[^h995] searcheth him out[^h2713]. 
###### 12
When righteous[^h6662] men do rejoice[^h5970], there is great[^h7227] glory[^h8597]: but when the wicked[^h7563] rise[^h6965], a man[^h120] is hidden[^h2664]. 
###### 13
He that covereth[^h3680] his sins[^h6588] shall not prosper[^h6743]: but whoso confesseth[^h3034] and forsaketh[^h5800] them shall have mercy[^h7355].
###### 14
Happy[^h835] is the man[^h120] that feareth[^h6342] alway[^h8548]: but he that hardeneth[^h7185] his heart[^h3820] shall fall[^h5307] into mischief[^h7451].
###### 15
As a roaring[^h5098] lion[^h738], and a ranging[^h8264] bear[^h1677]; so is a wicked[^h7563] ruler[^h4910] over the poor[^h1800] people[^h5971].
###### 16
The prince[^h5057] that wanteth[^h2638] understanding[^h8394] is also a great[^h7227] oppressor[^h4642]: but he that hateth[^h8130] covetousness[^h1215] shall prolong[^h748] his days[^h3117].
###### 17
A man[^h120] that doeth violence[^h6231] to the blood[^h1818] of any person[^h5315] shall flee[^h5127] to the pit[^h953]; let no man stay[^h8551] him.
###### 18
Whoso walketh[^h1980] uprightly[^h8549] shall be saved[^h3467]: but he that is perverse[^h6140] in his ways[^h1870] shall fall[^h5307] at once[^h259].
###### 19
He that tilleth[^h5647] his land[^h127] shall have plenty[^h7646] of bread[^h3899]: but he that followeth[^h7291] after vain[^h7386] persons shall have poverty enough[^h7389].
###### 20
A faithful[^h530] man[^h376] shall abound[^h7227] with blessings[^h1293]: but he that maketh haste[^h213] to be rich[^h6238] shall not be innocent[^h5352]. 
###### 21
To have respect[^h5234] of persons[^h6440] is not good[^h2896]: for for a piece[^h6595] of bread[^h3899] that man[^h1397] will transgress[^h6586].
###### 22
He[^h376] that hasteth[^h926] to be rich[^h1952] hath an evil[^h7451] eye[^h5869], and considereth[^h3045] not that poverty[^h2639] shall come[^h935] upon him. 
###### 23
He that rebuketh[^h3198] a man[^h120] afterwards[^h310] shall find[^h4672] more favour[^h2580] than he that flattereth[^h2505] with the tongue[^h3956].
###### 24
Whoso robbeth[^h1497] his father[^h1] or his mother[^h517], and saith[^h559], It is no transgression[^h6588]; the same is the companion[^h2270] of a destroyer[^h376] [^h7843]. 
###### 25
He that is of a proud[^h7342] heart[^h5315] stirreth up[^h1624] strife[^h4066]: but he that putteth his trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068] shall be made fat[^h1878].
###### 26
He that trusteth[^h982] in his own heart[^h3820] is a fool[^h3684]: but whoso walketh[^h1980] wisely[^h2451], he shall be delivered[^h4422].
###### 27
He that giveth[^h5414] unto the poor[^h7326] shall not lack[^h4270]: but he that hideth[^h5956] his eyes[^h5869] shall have many[^h7227] a curse[^h3994].
###### 28
When the wicked[^h7563] rise[^h6965], men[^h120] hide[^h5641] themselves: but when they perish[^h6], the righteous[^h6662] increase[^h7235].

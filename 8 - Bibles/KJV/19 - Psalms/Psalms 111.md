Praise[^h1984] ye the LORD[^h3050]. I will praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] with my whole heart[^h3824], in the assembly[^h5475] of the upright[^h3477], and in the congregation[^h5712].

His work[^h6467] is honourable[^h1935] and glorious[^h1926]: and his righteousness[^h6666] endureth[^h5975] for ever[^h5703].

###### 7
The works[^h4639] of his hands[^h3027] are verity[^h571] and judgment[^h4941]; all his commandments[^h6490] are sure[^h539].

They stand fast[^h5564] for ever[^h5703] and ever[^h5769], and are done[^h6213] in truth[^h571] and uprightness[^h3477]. 
###### 9
He sent[^h7971] redemption[^h6304] unto his people[^h5971]: he hath commanded[^h6680] his covenant[^h1285] for ever[^h5769]: holy[^h6918] and reverend[^h3372] is his name[^h8034].

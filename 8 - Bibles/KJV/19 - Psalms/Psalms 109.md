###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329], A Psalm[^h4210] of David[^h1732]. Hold not thy peace[^h2790], O God[^h430] of my praise[^h8416];
###### 2
For the mouth[^h6310] of the wicked[^h7563] and the mouth[^h6310] of the deceitful[^h4820] are opened[^h6605] against me: they have spoken[^h1696] against me with a lying[^h8267] tongue[^h3956].  
###### 3
They compassed[^h5437] me about also with words[^h1697] of hatred[^h8135]; and fought[^h3898] against me without a cause[^h2600].
###### 4
For my love[^h160] they are my adversaries[^h7853]: but I give myself unto prayer[^h8605].
###### 5
And they have rewarded[^h7760] me evil[^h7451] for good[^h2896], and hatred[^h8135] for my love[^h160].
###### 6
Set[^h6485] thou a wicked man[^h7563] over him: and let Satan[^h7854] stand[^h5975] at his right hand[^h3225]. 
###### 7
When he shall be judged[^h8199], let him be[^h3318] condemned[^h7563]: and let his prayer[^h8605] become sin[^h2401]. 
###### 8
Let his days[^h3117] be few[^h4592]; and let another[^h312] take[^h3947] his office[^h6486]. 
###### 9
Let his children[^h1121] be fatherless[^h3490], and his wife[^h802] a widow[^h490].
###### 10
Let his children[^h1121] be continually[^h5128] vagabonds[^h5128], and beg[^h7592]: let them seek[^h1875] their bread also out of their desolate places[^h2723].
###### 11
Let the extortioner[^h5383] catch[^h5367] all that he hath; and let the strangers[^h2114] spoil[^h962] his labour[^h3018].
###### 12
Let there be none to extend[^h4900] mercy[^h2617] unto him: neither let there be any to favour[^h2603] his fatherless children[^h3490].
###### 13
Let his posterity[^h319] be cut off[^h3772]; and in the generation[^h1755] following[^h312] let their name[^h8034] be blotted out[^h4229].
###### 14
Let the iniquity[^h5771] of his fathers[^h1] be remembered[^h2142] with the LORD[^h3068]; and let not the sin[^h2403] of his mother[^h517] be blotted out[^h4229].
###### 15
Let them be before the LORD[^h3068] continually[^h8548], that he may cut off[^h3772] the memory[^h2143] of them from the earth[^h776].
###### 16
Because that he remembered[^h2142] not to shew[^h6213] mercy[^h2617], but persecuted[^h7291] the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34] man[^h376], that he might even slay[^h4191] the broken[^h3512] in heart[^h3824].
###### 17
As he loved[^h157] cursing[^h7045], so let it come[^h935] unto him: as he delighted[^h2654] not in blessing[^h1293], so let it be far[^h7368] from him.
###### 18
As he clothed[^h3847] himself with cursing[^h7045] like as with his garment[^h4055], so let it come[^h935] into his bowels[^h7130] like water[^h4325], and like oil[^h8081] into his bones[^h6106]. 
###### 19
Let it be unto him as the garment[^h899] which covereth[^h5844] him, and for a girdle[^h4206] wherewith he is girded[^h2296] continually[^h8548].
###### 20
Let this be the reward[^h6468] of mine adversaries[^h7853] from the LORD[^h3068], and of them that speak[^h1696] evil[^h7451] against my soul[^h5315].
###### 21
But do[^h6213] thou for me, O GOD[^h3069] the Lord[^h136], for thy name's[^h8034] sake: because thy mercy[^h2617] is good[^h2896], deliver[^h5337] thou me.
###### 22
For I am poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34], and my heart[^h3820] is wounded[^h2490] within[^h7130] me.
###### 23
I am gone[^h1980] like the shadow[^h6738] when it declineth[^h5186]: I am tossed up and down[^h5287] as the locust[^h697].
###### 24
My knees[^h1290] are weak[^h3782] through fasting[^h6685]; and my flesh[^h1320] faileth[^h3584] of fatness[^h8081].
###### 25
I became also a reproach[^h2781] unto them: when they looked[^h7200] upon me they shaked[^h5128] their heads[^h7218].
###### 26
Help[^h5826] me, O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430]: O save[^h3467] me according to thy mercy[^h2617]:
###### 27
That they may know[^h3045] that this is thy hand[^h3027]; that thou, LORD[^h3068], hast done[^h6213] it.
###### 28
Let them curse[^h7043], but bless[^h1288] thou: when they arise[^h6965], let them be ashamed[^h954]; but let thy servant[^h5650] rejoice[^h8055].
###### 29
Let mine adversaries[^h7853] be clothed[^h3847] with shame[^h3639], and let them cover[^h5844] themselves with their own confusion[^h1322], as with a mantle[^h4598].
###### 30
I will greatly[^h3966] praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] with my mouth[^h6310]; yea, I will praise[^h1984] him among[^h8432] the multitude[^h7227].
###### 31
For he shall stand[^h5975] at the right hand[^h3225] of the poor[^h34], to save[^h3467] him from those that condemn[^h8199] his soul[^h5315].

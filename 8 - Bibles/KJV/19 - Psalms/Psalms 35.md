###### 1
A Psalm of David[^h1732]. Plead[^h7378] my cause, O LORD[^h3068], with them that strive[^h3401] with me: fight[^h3898] against them that fight[^h3898] against me.
###### 2
Take hold[^h2388] of shield[^h4043] and buckler[^h6793], and stand up[^h6965] for mine help[^h5833].
###### 3
Draw out[^h7324] also the spear[^h2595], and stop[^h5462] the way against[^h7125] them that persecute[^h7291] me: say[^h559] unto my soul[^h5315], I am thy salvation[^h3444].
###### 4
Let them be confounded[^h954] and put to shame[^h3637] that seek[^h1245] after my soul[^h5315]: let them be turned[^h5472] back[^h268] and brought to confusion[^h2659] that devise[^h2803] my hurt[^h7451].
###### 5
Let them be as chaff[^h4671] before[^h6440] the wind[^h7307]: and let the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] chase[^h1760] them.
###### 6
Let their way[^h1870] be dark[^h2822] and slippery[^h2519]: and let the angel[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] persecute[^h7291] them. 
###### 7
For without cause[^h2600] have they hid[^h2934] for me their net[^h7568] in a pit[^h7845], which without cause[^h2600] they have digged[^h2658] for my soul[^h5315].
###### 8
Let destruction[^h7722] come[^h935] upon him at unawares[^h3045] [^h3808]; and let his net[^h7568] that he hath hid[^h2934] catch[^h3920] himself: into that very destruction[^h7722] let him fall[^h5307]. 
###### 9
And my soul[^h5315] shall be joyful[^h1523] in the LORD[^h3068]: it shall rejoice[^h7797] in his salvation[^h3444].
###### 10
All my bones[^h6106] shall say[^h559], LORD[^h3068], who is like unto thee, which deliverest[^h5337] the poor[^h6041] from him that is too strong[^h2389] for him, yea, the poor[^h6041] and the needy[^h34] from him that spoileth[^h1497] him?
###### 11
False[^h2555] witnesses[^h5707] did rise up[^h6965]; they laid to my charge[^h7592] things that I knew[^h3045] not.  
###### 12
They rewarded[^h7999] me evil[^h7451] for good[^h2896] to the spoiling[^h7908] of my soul[^h5315]. 
###### 13
But as for me, when they were sick[^h2470], my clothing[^h3830] was sackcloth[^h8242]: I humbled[^h6031] my soul[^h5315] with fasting[^h6685]; and my prayer[^h8605] returned[^h7725] into mine own bosom[^h2436]. 
###### 14
I behaved[^h1980] myself as though he had been my friend[^h7453] or brother[^h251]: I bowed down[^h7817] heavily[^h6937], as one that mourneth[^h57] for his mother[^h517].  
###### 15
But in mine adversity[^h6761] they rejoiced[^h8055], and gathered themselves together[^h622]: yea, the abjects[^h5222] gathered themselves together[^h622] against me, and I knew[^h3045] it not; they did tear[^h7167] me, and ceased[^h1826] not: 
###### 16
With hypocritical[^h2611] mockers[^h3934] in feasts[^h4580], they gnashed[^h2786] upon me with their teeth[^h8127].
###### 17
Lord[^h136], how long wilt thou look on[^h7200]? rescue[^h7725] my soul[^h5315] from their destructions[^h7722], my darling[^h3173] from the lions[^h3715]. 
###### 18
I will give thee thanks[^h3034] in the great[^h7227] congregation[^h6951]: I will praise[^h1984] thee among much[^h6099] people[^h5971]. 
###### 19
Let not them that are mine enemies[^h341] wrongfully[^h8267] rejoice[^h8055] over me: neither let them wink[^h7169] with the eye[^h5869] that hate[^h8130] me without a cause[^h2600]. 
###### 20
For they speak[^h1696] not peace[^h7965]: but they devise[^h2803] deceitful[^h4820] matters[^h1697] against them that are quiet[^h7282] in the land[^h776].
###### 21
Yea, they opened their mouth[^h6310] wide[^h7337] against me, and said[^h559], Aha[^h1889], aha[^h1889], our eye[^h5869] hath seen[^h7200] it.
###### 22
This thou hast seen[^h7200], O LORD[^h3068]: keep not silence[^h2790]: O Lord[^h136], be not far[^h7368] from me.
###### 23
Stir up[^h5782] thyself, and awake[^h6974] to my judgment[^h4941], even unto my cause[^h7379], my God[^h430] and my Lord[^h136].
###### 24
Judge[^h8199] me, O LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], according to thy righteousness[^h6664]; and let them not rejoice[^h8055] over me.
###### 25
Let them not say[^h559] in their hearts[^h3820], Ah[^h1889], so would we have it[^h5315]: let them not say[^h559], We have swallowed him up[^h1104]. 
###### 26
Let them be ashamed[^h954] and brought to confusion[^h2659] together[^h3162] that rejoice[^h8056] at mine hurt[^h7451]: let them be clothed[^h3847] with shame[^h1322] and dishonour[^h3639] that magnify[^h1431] themselves against me.
###### 27
Let them shout for joy[^h7442], and be glad[^h8055], that favour[^h2655] my righteous cause[^h6664]: yea, let them say[^h559] continually[^h8548], Let the LORD[^h3068] be magnified[^h1431], which hath pleasure[^h2655] in the prosperity[^h7965] of his servant[^h5650]. 
###### 28
And my tongue[^h3956] shall speak[^h1897] of thy righteousness[^h6664] and of thy praise[^h8416] all the day[^h3117] long.

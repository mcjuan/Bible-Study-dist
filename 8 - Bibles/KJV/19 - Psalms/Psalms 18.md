###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329], A Psalm of David[^h1732], the servant[^h5650] of the LORD[^h3068], who spake[^h1696] unto the LORD[^h3068] the words[^h1697] of this song[^h7892] in the day[^h3117] that the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5337] him from the hand[^h3709] of all his enemies[^h341], and from the hand[^h3027] of Saul[^h7586]: And he said[^h559], I will love[^h7355] thee, O LORD[^h3068], my strength[^h2391].
###### 2
The LORD[^h3068] is my rock[^h5553], and my fortress[^h4686], and my deliverer[^h6403]; my God[^h410], my strength[^h6697], in whom I will trust[^h2620]; my buckler[^h4043], and the horn[^h7161] of my salvation[^h3468], and my high tower[^h4869]. 
###### 3
I will call[^h7121] upon the LORD[^h3068], who is worthy to be praised[^h1984]: so shall I be saved[^h3467] from mine enemies[^h341].
###### 4
The sorrows[^h2256] of death[^h4194] compassed[^h661] me, and the floods[^h5158] of ungodly men[^h1100] made me afraid[^h1204]. 
###### 5
The sorrows[^h2256] of hell[^h7585] compassed me about[^h5437]: the snares[^h4170] of death[^h4194] prevented[^h6923] me. 
###### 6
In my distress[^h6862] I called[^h7121] upon the LORD[^h3068], and cried[^h7768] unto my God[^h430]: he heard[^h8085] my voice[^h6963] out of his temple[^h1964], and my cry[^h7775] came[^h935] before[^h6440] him, even into his ears[^h241].
###### 7
Then the earth[^h776] shook[^h1607] and trembled[^h7493]; the foundations[^h4146] also of the hills[^h2022] moved[^h7264] and were shaken[^h1607], because he was wroth[^h2734].
###### 8
There went up[^h5927] a smoke[^h6227] out of his nostrils[^h639], and fire[^h784] out of his mouth[^h6310] devoured[^h398]: coals[^h1513] were kindled[^h1197] by it. 
###### 9
He bowed[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064] also, and came down[^h3381]: and darkness[^h6205] was under his feet[^h7272].
###### 10
And he rode[^h7392] upon a cherub[^h3742], and did fly[^h5774]: yea, he did fly[^h1675] upon the wings[^h3671] of the wind[^h7307].
###### 11
He made[^h7896] darkness[^h2822] his secret place[^h5643]; his pavilion[^h5521] round about[^h5439] him were dark[^h2824] waters[^h4325] and thick clouds[^h5645] of the skies[^h7834].
###### 12
At the brightness[^h5051] that was before him his thick clouds[^h5645] passed[^h5674], hail[^h1259] stones and coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784].
###### 13
The LORD[^h3068] also thundered[^h7481] in the heavens[^h8064], and the Highest[^h5945] gave[^h5414] his voice[^h6963]; hail[^h1259] stones and coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784].
###### 14
Yea, he sent out[^h7971] his arrows[^h2671], and scattered[^h6327] them; and he shot out[^h7232] lightnings[^h1300], and discomfited[^h2000] them.
###### 15
Then the channels[^h650] of waters[^h4325] were seen[^h7200], and the foundations[^h4146] of the world[^h8398] were discovered[^h1540] at thy rebuke[^h1606], O LORD[^h3068], at the blast[^h5397] of the breath[^h7307] of thy nostrils[^h639].
###### 16
He sent[^h7971] from above[^h4791], he took[^h3947] me, he drew[^h4871] me out of many[^h7227] waters[^h4325]. 
###### 17
He delivered[^h5337] me from my strong[^h5794] enemy[^h341], and from them which hated[^h8130] me: for they were too strong[^h553] for me.
###### 18
They prevented[^h6923] me in the day[^h3117] of my calamity[^h343]: but the LORD[^h3068] was my stay[^h4937].
###### 19
He brought me forth[^h3318] also into a large place[^h4800]; he delivered[^h2502] me, because he delighted[^h2654] in me.
###### 20
The LORD[^h3068] rewarded[^h1580] me according to my righteousness[^h6664]; according to the cleanness[^h1252] of my hands[^h3027] hath he recompensed[^h7725] me.
###### 21
For I have kept[^h8104] the ways[^h1870] of the LORD[^h3068], and have not wickedly departed[^h7561] from my God[^h430].
###### 22
For all his judgments[^h4941] were before me, and I did not put away[^h5493] his statutes[^h2708] from me.
###### 23
I was also upright[^h8549] before him, and I kept[^h8104] myself from mine iniquity[^h5771]. 
###### 24
Therefore hath the LORD[^h3068] recompensed[^h7725] me according to my righteousness[^h6664], according to the cleanness[^h1252] of my hands[^h3027] in his eyesight[^h5869]. 
###### 25
With the merciful[^h2623] thou wilt shew thyself merciful[^h2616]; with an upright[^h8549] man[^h1399] thou wilt shew thyself upright[^h8552];
###### 26
With the pure[^h1305] thou wilt shew thyself pure[^h1305]; and with the froward[^h6141] thou wilt shew thyself froward[^h6617]. 
###### 27
For thou wilt save[^h3467] the afflicted[^h6041] people[^h5971]; but wilt bring down[^h8213] high[^h7311] looks[^h5869].
###### 28
For thou wilt light[^h215] my candle[^h5216]: the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430] will enlighten[^h5050] my darkness[^h2822]. 
###### 29
For by thee I have run through[^h7323] a troop[^h1416]; and by my God[^h430] have I leaped over[^h1801] a wall[^h7791]. 
###### 30
As for God[^h410], his way[^h1870] is perfect[^h8549]: the word[^h565] of the LORD[^h3068] is tried[^h6884]: he is a buckler[^h4043] to all those that trust[^h2620] in him. 
###### 31
For who is God[^h433] save[^h1107] the LORD[^h3068]? or who is a rock[^h6697] save[^h2108] our God[^h430]?
###### 32
It is God[^h410] that girdeth[^h247] me with strength[^h2428], and maketh[^h5414] my way[^h1870] perfect[^h8549].
###### 33
He maketh[^h7737] my feet[^h7272] like hinds'[^h355] feet, and setteth[^h5975] me upon my high places[^h1116].
###### 34
He teacheth[^h3925] my hands[^h3027] to war[^h4421], so that a bow[^h7198] of steel[^h5154] is broken[^h5181] by mine arms[^h2220].
###### 35
Thou hast also given[^h5414] me the shield[^h4043] of thy salvation[^h3468]: and thy right hand[^h3225] hath holden me up[^h5582], and thy gentleness[^h6037] hath made me great[^h7235]. 
###### 36
Thou hast enlarged[^h7337] my steps[^h6806] under me, that my feet[^h7166] did not slip[^h4571]. 
###### 37
I have pursued[^h7291] mine enemies[^h341], and overtaken[^h5381] them: neither did I turn again[^h7725] till they were consumed[^h3615].
###### 38
I have wounded[^h4272] them that they were not able[^h3201] to rise[^h6965]: they are fallen[^h5307] under my feet[^h7272].
###### 39
For thou hast girded[^h247] me with strength[^h2428] unto the battle[^h4421]: thou hast subdued[^h3766] under me those that rose up[^h6965] against me. 
###### 40
Thou hast also given[^h5414] me the necks[^h6203] of mine enemies[^h341]; that I might destroy[^h6789] them that hate[^h8130] me.
###### 41
They cried[^h7768], but there was none to save[^h3467] them: even unto the LORD[^h3068], but he answered[^h6030] them not.
###### 42
Then did I beat[^h7833] them small as the dust[^h6083] before[^h6440] the wind[^h7307]: I did cast them out[^h7324] as the dirt[^h2916] in the streets[^h2351].
###### 43
Thou hast delivered[^h6403] me from the strivings[^h7379] of the people[^h5971]; and thou hast made[^h7760] me the head[^h7218] of the heathen[^h1471]: a people[^h5971] whom I have not known[^h3045] shall serve[^h5647] me.
###### 44
As soon as they hear[^h8088] [^h241] of me, they shall obey[^h8085] me: the strangers[^h1121] [^h5236] shall submit[^h3584] themselves unto me.   
###### 45
The strangers[^h1121] [^h5236] shall fade away[^h5034], and be afraid[^h2727] out of their close places[^h4526]. 
###### 46
The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416]; and blessed[^h1288] be my rock[^h6697]; and let the God[^h430] of my salvation[^h3468] be exalted[^h7311].
###### 47
It is God[^h410] that avengeth[^h5414] [^h5360] me, and subdueth[^h1696] the people[^h5971] under me.  
###### 48
He delivereth[^h6403] me from mine enemies[^h341]: yea, thou liftest me up[^h7311] above those that rise up[^h6965] against me: thou hast delivered[^h5337] me from the violent[^h2555] man[^h376]. 
###### 49
Therefore will I give thanks[^h3034] unto thee, O LORD[^h3068], among the heathen[^h1471], and sing praises[^h2167] unto thy name[^h8034]. 
###### 50
Great[^h1431] deliverance[^h3444] giveth he to his king[^h4428]; and sheweth[^h6213] mercy[^h2617] to his anointed[^h4899], to David[^h1732], and to his seed[^h2233] for[^h5704] evermore[^h5769].

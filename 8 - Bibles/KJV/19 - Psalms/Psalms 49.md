###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329], A Psalm[^h4210] for the sons[^h1121] of Korah[^h7141]. Hear[^h8085] this, all ye people[^h5971]; give ear[^h238], all ye inhabitants[^h3427] of the world[^h2465]: 
###### 2
Both low[^h1121] [^h120] and high[^h1121] [^h376], rich[^h6223] and poor[^h34], together[^h3162].
###### 3
My mouth[^h6310] shall speak[^h1696] of wisdom[^h2454]; and the meditation[^h1900] of my heart[^h3820] shall be of understanding[^h8394].
###### 4
I will incline[^h5186] mine ear[^h241] to a parable[^h4912]: I will open[^h6605] my dark saying[^h2420] upon the harp[^h3658].
###### 5
Wherefore should I fear[^h3372] in the days[^h3117] of evil[^h7451], when the iniquity[^h5771] of my heels[^h6120] shall compass[^h5437] me about?
###### 6
They that trust[^h982] in their wealth[^h2428], and boast[^h1984] themselves in the multitude[^h7230] of their riches[^h6239];
###### 7
None of them can[^h376] by any means[^h6299] redeem[^h6299] his brother[^h251], nor give[^h5414] to God[^h430] a ransom[^h3724] for him:
###### 8
(For the redemption[^h6306] of their soul[^h5315] is precious[^h3365], and it ceaseth[^h2308] for ever[^h5769]:)
###### 9
That he should still live[^h2421] for ever[^h5331], and not see[^h7200] corruption[^h7845].
###### 10
For he seeth[^h7200] that wise men[^h2450] die[^h4191], likewise[^h3162] the fool[^h3684] and the brutish person[^h1198] perish[^h6], and leave[^h5800] their wealth[^h2428] to others[^h312].
###### 11
Their inward[^h7130] thought is, that their houses[^h1004] shall continue for ever[^h5769], and their dwelling[^h4908] places to all[^h1755] generations[^h1755]; they call[^h7121] their lands[^h127] after their own names[^h8034]. 
###### 12
Nevertheless man[^h120] being in honour[^h3366] abideth[^h3885] not: he is like[^h4911] the beasts[^h929] that perish[^h1820].
###### 13
This their way[^h1870] is their folly[^h3689]: yet their posterity[^h310] approve[^h7521] their sayings[^h6310]. Selah[^h5542]. 
###### 14
Like sheep[^h6629] they are laid[^h8371] in the grave[^h7585]; death[^h4194] shall feed[^h7462] on them; and the upright[^h3477] shall have dominion[^h7287] over them in the morning[^h1242]; and their beauty[^h6697] [^h6736] shall consume[^h1086] in the grave[^h7585] from their dwelling[^h2073].  
###### 15
But God[^h430] will redeem[^h6299] my soul[^h5315] from the power[^h3027] of the grave[^h7585]: for he shall receive[^h3947] me. Selah[^h5542].  
###### 16
Be not thou afraid[^h3372] when one[^h376] is made rich[^h6238], when the glory[^h3519] of his house[^h1004] is increased[^h7235];
###### 17
For when he dieth[^h4194] he shall carry nothing away[^h3947]: his glory[^h3519] shall not descend[^h3381] after[^h310] him.
###### 18
Though while he lived[^h2416] he blessed[^h1288] his soul[^h5315]: and men will praise[^h3034] thee, when thou doest well[^h3190] to thyself. 
###### 19
He shall go[^h935] to the generation[^h1755] of his fathers[^h1]; they shall never[^h3808] [^h5331] see[^h7200] light[^h216]. 
###### 20
Man[^h120] that is in honour[^h3366], and understandeth[^h995] not, is like[^h4911] the beasts[^h929] that perish[^h1820].

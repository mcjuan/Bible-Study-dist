###### 1
Not unto us, O LORD[^h3068], not unto us, but unto thy name[^h8034] give[^h5414] glory[^h3519], for thy mercy[^h2617], and for thy truth's[^h571] sake.
###### 2
Wherefore should the heathen[^h1471] say[^h559], Where is now their God[^h430]?

###### 4
Their idols[^h6091] are silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], the work[^h4639] of men's[^h120] hands[^h3027].
###### 5
They have mouths[^h6310], but they speak[^h1696] not: eyes[^h5869] have they, but they see[^h7200] not:
###### 6
They have ears[^h241], but they hear[^h8085] not: noses[^h639] have they, but they smell[^h7306] not:
###### 7
They have hands[^h3027], but they handle[^h4184] not: feet[^h7272] have they, but they walk[^h1980] not: neither speak[^h1897] they through their throat[^h1627].
###### 8
They that make[^h6213] them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth[^h982] in them.

O Israel[^h3478], trust[^h982] thou in the LORD[^h3068]: he is their help[^h5828] and their shield[^h4043].
###### 10
O house[^h1004] of Aaron[^h175], trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068]: he is their help[^h5828] and their shield[^h4043].
###### 11
Ye that fear[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068]: he is their help[^h5828] and their shield[^h4043].
###### 12
The LORD[^h3068] hath been mindful[^h2142] of us: he will bless[^h1288] us; he will bless[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; he will bless[^h1288] the house[^h1004] of Aaron[^h175].
###### 13
He will bless[^h1288] them that fear[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], both small[^h6996] and great[^h1419]. 
###### 14
The LORD[^h3068] shall increase[^h3254] you more and more, you and your children[^h1121].
###### 15
Ye are blessed[^h1288] of the LORD[^h3068] which made[^h6213] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776].
###### 16
The heaven[^h8064], even the heavens[^h8064], are the LORD'S[^h3068]: but the earth[^h776] hath he given[^h5414] to the children[^h1121] of men[^h120].
###### 17
The dead[^h4191] praise[^h1984] not the LORD[^h3050], neither any that go down[^h3381] into silence[^h1745].
###### 18
But we will bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3050] from this time forth and for[^h5704] evermore[^h5769]. Praise[^h1984] the LORD[^h3050].

###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329] on Neginoth[^h5058], Maschil[^h4905], A Psalm of David[^h1732]. Give ear[^h238] to my prayer[^h8605], O God[^h430]; and hide[^h5956] not thyself from my supplication[^h8467].
###### 2
Attend[^h7181] unto me, and hear[^h6030] me: I mourn[^h7300] in my complaint[^h7879], and make a noise[^h1949];
###### 3
Because of the voice[^h6963] of the enemy[^h341], because[^h6440] of the oppression[^h6125] of the wicked[^h7563]: for they cast[^h4131] iniquity[^h205] upon me, and in wrath[^h639] they hate[^h7852] me.
###### 4
My heart[^h3820] is sore pained[^h2342] within[^h7130] me: and the terrors[^h367] of death[^h4194] are fallen[^h5307] upon me.
###### 5
Fearfulness[^h3374] and trembling[^h7461] are come[^h935] upon me, and horror[^h6427] hath overwhelmed[^h3680] me. 
###### 6
And I said[^h559], Oh that[^h5414] I had wings[^h83] like a dove[^h3123]! for then would I fly away[^h5774], and be at rest[^h7931].
###### 7
Lo, then would I wander[^h5074] far off[^h7368], and remain[^h3885] in the wilderness[^h4057]. Selah[^h5542].
###### 8
I would hasten[^h2363] my escape[^h4655] from the windy[^h7307] storm[^h5584] and tempest[^h5591].
###### 9
Destroy[^h1104], O Lord[^h136], and divide[^h6385] their tongues[^h3956]: for I have seen[^h7200] violence[^h2555] and strife[^h7379] in the city[^h5892].
###### 10
Day[^h3119] and night[^h3915] they go about[^h5437] it upon the walls[^h2346] thereof: mischief[^h205] also and sorrow[^h5999] are in the midst[^h7130] of it.
###### 11
Wickedness[^h1942] is in the midst[^h7130] thereof: deceit[^h8496] and guile[^h4820] depart[^h4185] not from her streets[^h7339].
###### 12
For it was not an enemy[^h341] that reproached[^h2778] me; then I could have borne[^h5375] it: neither was it he that hated[^h8130] me that did magnify[^h1431] himself against me; then I would have hid[^h5641] myself from him:
###### 13
But it was thou, a man[^h582] mine equal[^h6187], my guide[^h441], and mine acquaintance[^h3045]. 
###### 14
We took sweet[^h4985] counsel[^h5475] together[^h3162], and walked[^h1980] unto the house[^h1004] of God[^h430] in company[^h7285]. 
###### 15
Let death[^h4194] seize[^h5377] [^h3451] upon them, and let them go down[^h3381] quick[^h2416] into hell[^h7585]: for wickedness[^h7451] is in their dwellings[^h4033], and among[^h7130] them. 
###### 16
As for me, I will call[^h7121] upon God[^h430]; and the LORD[^h3068] shall save[^h3467] me.
###### 17
Evening[^h6153], and morning[^h1242], and at noon[^h6672], will I pray[^h7878], and cry aloud[^h1993]: and he shall hear[^h8085] my voice[^h6963].
###### 18
He hath delivered[^h6299] my soul[^h5315] in peace[^h7965] from the battle[^h7128] that was against me: for there were many[^h7227] with me.
###### 19
God[^h410] shall hear[^h8085], and afflict[^h6030] them, even he that abideth[^h3427] of old[^h6924]. Selah[^h5542]. Because they have no changes[^h2487], therefore they fear[^h3372] not God[^h430]. 
###### 20
He hath put forth[^h7971] his hands[^h3027] against such as be at peace[^h7965] with him: he hath broken[^h2490] his covenant[^h1285]. 
###### 21
The words of his mouth[^h6310] were smoother[^h2505] than butter[^h4260], but war[^h7128] was in his heart[^h3820]: his words[^h1697] were softer[^h7401] than oil[^h8081], yet were they drawn swords[^h6609].
###### 22
Cast[^h7993] thy burden[^h3053] upon the LORD[^h3068], and he shall sustain[^h3557] thee: he shall never[^h5769] suffer[^h5414] the righteous[^h6662] to be moved[^h4131]. 
###### 23
But thou, O God[^h430], shalt bring them down[^h3381] into the pit[^h875] of destruction[^h7845]: bloody[^h1818] and deceitful[^h4820] men[^h582] shall not live out half[^h2673] their days[^h3117]; but I will trust[^h982] in thee.

###### 1
Maschil[^h4905] of Asaph[^h623]. Give ear[^h238], O my people[^h5971], to my law[^h8451]: incline[^h5186] your ears[^h241] to the words[^h561] of my mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 2
I will open[^h6605] my mouth[^h6310] in a parable[^h4912]: I will utter[^h5042] dark sayings[^h2420] of old[^h6924]:
###### 3
Which we have heard[^h8085] and known[^h3045], and our fathers[^h1] have told[^h5608] us.
###### 4
We will not hide[^h3582] them from their children[^h1121], shewing[^h5608] to the generation[^h1755] to come[^h314] the praises[^h8416] of the LORD[^h3068], and his strength[^h5807], and his wonderful works[^h6381] that he hath done[^h6213].
###### 5
For he established[^h6965] a testimony[^h5715] in Jacob[^h3290], and appointed[^h7760] a law[^h8451] in Israel[^h3478], which he commanded[^h6680] our fathers[^h1], that they should make them known[^h3045] to their children[^h1121]:
###### 6
That the generation[^h1755] to come[^h314] might know[^h3045] them, even the children[^h1121] which should be born[^h3205]; who should arise[^h6965] and declare[^h5608] them to their children[^h1121]:
###### 7
That they might set[^h7760] their hope[^h3689] in God[^h430], and not forget[^h7911] the works[^h4611] of God[^h410], but keep[^h5341] his commandments[^h4687]:
###### 8
And might not be as their fathers[^h1], a stubborn[^h5637] and rebellious[^h4784] generation[^h1755]; a generation[^h1755] that set[^h3559] not their heart[^h3820] aright[^h3559], and whose spirit[^h7307] was not stedfast[^h539] with God[^h410]. 
###### 9
The children[^h1121] of Ephraim[^h669], being armed[^h5401], and carrying[^h7411] bows[^h7198], turned back[^h2015] in the day[^h3117] of battle[^h7128]. 
###### 10
They kept[^h8104] not the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430], and refused[^h3985] to walk[^h3212] in his law[^h8451];
###### 11
And forgat[^h7911] his works[^h5949], and his wonders[^h6381] that he had shewed[^h7200] them.
###### 12
Marvellous things[^h6382] did[^h6213] he in the sight[^h5048] of their fathers[^h1], in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in the field[^h7704] of Zoan[^h6814].
###### 13
He divided[^h1234] the sea[^h3220], and caused them to pass through[^h5674]; and he made the waters[^h4325] to stand[^h5324] as an heap[^h5067].
###### 14
In the daytime[^h3119] also he led[^h5148] them with a cloud[^h6051], and all the night[^h3915] with a light[^h216] of fire[^h784].
###### 15
He clave[^h1234] the rocks[^h6697] in the wilderness[^h4057], and gave them drink[^h8248] as out of the great[^h7227] depths[^h8415].
###### 16
He brought[^h3318] streams[^h5140] also out of the rock[^h5553], and caused waters[^h4325] to run down[^h3381] like rivers[^h5104].
###### 17
And they sinned[^h2398] yet more[^h3254] against him by provoking[^h4784] the most High[^h5945] in the wilderness[^h6723].
###### 18
And they tempted[^h5254] God[^h410] in their heart[^h3824] by asking[^h7592] meat[^h400] for their lust[^h5315].
###### 19
Yea, they spake[^h1696] against God[^h430]; they said[^h559], Can[^h3201] God[^h410] furnish[^h6186] a table[^h7979] in the wilderness[^h4057]? 
###### 20
Behold, he smote[^h5221] the rock[^h6697], that the waters[^h4325] gushed out[^h2100], and the streams[^h5158] overflowed[^h7857]; can[^h3201] he give[^h5414] bread[^h3899] also? can[^h3201] he provide[^h3559] flesh[^h7607] for his people[^h5971]?
###### 21
Therefore the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h8085] this, and was wroth[^h5674]: so a fire[^h784] was kindled[^h5400] against Jacob[^h3290], and anger[^h639] also came up[^h5927] against Israel[^h3478];
###### 22
Because they believed[^h539] not in God[^h430], and trusted[^h982] not in his salvation[^h3444]:
###### 23
Though he had commanded[^h6680] the clouds[^h7834] from above[^h4605], and opened[^h6605] the doors[^h1817] of heaven[^h8064],
###### 24
And had rained down[^h4305] manna[^h4478] upon them to eat[^h398], and had given[^h5414] them of the corn[^h1715] of heaven[^h8064].
###### 25
Man[^h376] did eat[^h398] angels'[^h47] food[^h3899]: he sent[^h7971] them meat[^h6720] to the full[^h7648]. 
###### 26
He caused an east wind[^h6921] to blow[^h5265] in the heaven[^h8064]: and by his power[^h5797] he brought in[^h5090] the south wind[^h8486]. 
###### 27
He rained[^h4305] flesh[^h7607] also upon them as dust[^h6083], and feathered[^h3671] fowls[^h5775] like as the sand[^h2344] of the sea[^h3220]: 
###### 28
And he let it fall[^h5307] in the midst[^h7130] of their camp[^h4264], round about[^h5439] their habitations[^h4908].
###### 29
So they did eat[^h398], and were well[^h3966] filled[^h7646]: for he gave[^h935] them their own desire[^h8378];
###### 30
They were not estranged[^h2114] from their lust[^h8378]. But while their meat[^h400] was yet in their mouths[^h6310],
###### 31
The wrath[^h639] of God[^h430] came[^h5927] upon them, and slew[^h2026] the fattest[^h4924] of them, and smote down[^h3766] the chosen[^h970] men of Israel[^h3478].  
###### 32
For all this they sinned[^h2398] still, and believed[^h539] not for his wondrous works[^h6381].
###### 33
Therefore their days[^h3117] did he consume[^h3615] in vanity[^h1892], and their years[^h8141] in trouble[^h928].
###### 34
When he slew[^h2026] them, then they sought[^h1875] him: and they returned[^h7725] and enquired early[^h7836] after God[^h410].
###### 35
And they remembered[^h2142] that God[^h430] was their rock[^h6697], and the high[^h5945] God[^h410] their redeemer[^h1350].
###### 36
Nevertheless they did flatter[^h6601] him with their mouth[^h6310], and they lied[^h3576] unto him with their tongues[^h3956].
###### 37
For their heart[^h3820] was not right[^h3559] with him, neither were they stedfast[^h539] in his covenant[^h1285].
###### 38
But he, being full of compassion[^h7349], forgave[^h3722] their iniquity[^h5771], and destroyed[^h7843] them not: yea, many a time[^h7235] turned[^h7725] he his anger[^h639] away[^h7725], and did not stir up[^h5782] all his wrath[^h2534].
###### 39
For he remembered[^h2142] that they were but flesh[^h1320]; a wind[^h7307] that passeth away[^h1980], and cometh not again[^h7725].
###### 40
How[^h4100] oft did they provoke[^h4784] him in the wilderness[^h4057], and grieve[^h6087] him in the desert[^h3452]! 
###### 41
Yea, they turned back[^h7725] and tempted[^h5254] God[^h410], and limited[^h8428] the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 42
They remembered[^h2142] not his hand[^h3027], nor the day[^h3117] when he delivered[^h6299] them from the enemy[^h6862]. 
###### 43
How he had wrought[^h7760] his signs[^h226] in Egypt[^h4714], and his wonders[^h4159] in the field[^h7704] of Zoan[^h6814]: 
###### 44
And had turned[^h2015] their rivers[^h2975] into blood[^h1818]; and their floods[^h5140], that they could not drink[^h8354].
###### 45
He sent[^h7971] divers sorts of flies[^h6157] among them, which devoured[^h398] them; and frogs[^h6854], which destroyed[^h7843] them.
###### 46
He gave[^h5414] also their increase[^h2981] unto the caterpiller[^h2625], and their labour[^h3018] unto the locust[^h697].
###### 47
He destroyed[^h2026] their vines[^h1612] with hail[^h1259], and their sycomore trees[^h8256] with frost[^h2602].  
###### 48
He gave up[^h5462] their cattle[^h1165] also to the hail[^h1259], and their flocks[^h4735] to hot thunderbolts[^h7565].  
###### 49
He cast[^h7971] upon them the fierceness[^h2740] of his anger[^h639], wrath[^h5678], and indignation[^h2195], and trouble[^h6869], by sending[^h4917] evil[^h7451] angels[^h4397] among them.
###### 50
He made[^h6424] a way[^h5410] to his anger[^h639]; he spared[^h2820] not their soul[^h5315] from death[^h4194], but gave[^h5462] their life[^h2416] over[^h5462] to the pestilence[^h1698];  
###### 51
And smote[^h5221] all the firstborn[^h1060] in Egypt[^h4714]; the chief[^h7225] of their strength[^h202] in the tabernacles[^h168] of Ham[^h2526]:
###### 52
But made his own people[^h5971] to go forth[^h5265] like sheep[^h6629], and guided[^h5090] them in the wilderness[^h4057] like a flock[^h5739].
###### 53
And he led[^h5148] them on safely[^h983], so that they feared[^h6342] not: but the sea[^h3220] overwhelmed[^h3680] their enemies[^h341]. 
###### 54
And he brought[^h935] them to the border[^h1366] of his sanctuary[^h6944], even to this mountain[^h2022], which his right hand[^h3225] had purchased[^h7069].
###### 55
He cast out[^h1644] the heathen[^h1471] also before[^h6440] them, and divided[^h5307] them an inheritance[^h5159] by line[^h2256], and made the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to dwell[^h7931] in their tents[^h168].
###### 56
Yet they tempted[^h5254] and provoked[^h4784] the most high[^h5945] God[^h430], and kept[^h8104] not his testimonies[^h5713]:
###### 57
But turned back[^h5472], and dealt unfaithfully[^h898] like their fathers[^h1]: they were turned aside[^h2015] like a deceitful[^h7423] bow[^h7198].
###### 58
For they provoked him to anger[^h3707] with their high places[^h1116], and moved him to jealousy[^h7065] with their graven images[^h6456].
###### 59
When God[^h430] heard[^h8085] this, he was wroth[^h5674], and greatly[^h3966] abhorred[^h3988] Israel[^h3478]:
###### 60
So that he forsook[^h5203] the tabernacle[^h4908] of Shiloh[^h7887], the tent[^h168] which he placed[^h7931] among men[^h120];
###### 61
And delivered[^h5414] his strength[^h5797] into captivity[^h7628], and his glory[^h8597] into the enemy's[^h6862] hand[^h3027].
###### 62
He gave[^h5462] his people[^h5971] over[^h5462] also unto the sword[^h2719]; and was wroth[^h5674] with his inheritance[^h5159].
###### 63
The fire[^h784] consumed[^h398] their young men[^h970]; and their maidens[^h1330] were not given to marriage[^h1984]. 
###### 64
Their priests[^h3548] fell[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]; and their widows[^h490] made no lamentation[^h1058].
###### 65
Then the Lord[^h136] awaked[^h3364] as one out of sleep[^h3463], and like a mighty man[^h1368] that shouteth[^h7442] by reason of wine[^h3196].
###### 66
And he smote[^h5221] his enemies[^h6862] in the hinder parts[^h268]: he put[^h5414] them to a perpetual[^h5769] reproach[^h2781].
###### 67
Moreover he refused[^h3988] the tabernacle[^h168] of Joseph[^h3130], and chose[^h977] not the tribe[^h7626] of Ephraim[^h669]:
###### 68
But chose[^h977] the tribe[^h7626] of Judah[^h3063], the mount[^h2022] Zion[^h6726] which he loved[^h157].
###### 69
And he built[^h1129] his sanctuary[^h4720] like high[^h7311] palaces, like the earth[^h776] which he hath established[^h3245] for ever[^h5769]. 
###### 70
He chose[^h977] David[^h1732] also his servant[^h5650], and took[^h3947] him from the sheepfolds[^h4356] [^h6629]:
###### 71
From following[^h310] the ewes great with young[^h5763] he brought[^h935] him to feed[^h7462] Jacob[^h3290] his people[^h5971], and Israel[^h3478] his inheritance[^h5159]. 
###### 72
So he fed[^h7462] them according to the integrity[^h8537] of his heart[^h3824]; and guided[^h5148] them by the skilfulness[^h8394] of his hands[^h3709].

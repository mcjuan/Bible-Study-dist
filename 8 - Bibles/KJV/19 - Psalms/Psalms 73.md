###### 1
A Psalm[^h4210] of Asaph[^h623]. Truly God[^h430] is good[^h2896] to Israel[^h3478], even to such as are of a clean[^h1249] heart[^h3824].   
###### 2
But as for me, my feet[^h7272] were almost[^h4592] gone[^h5186] [^h5186]; my steps[^h838] had well nigh[^h369] slipped[^h8210].
###### 3
For I was envious[^h7065] at the foolish[^h1984], when I saw[^h7200] the prosperity[^h7965] of the wicked[^h7563].
###### 4
For there are no bands[^h2784] in their death[^h4194]: but their strength[^h193] is firm[^h1277]. 
###### 5
They are not in trouble[^h5999] as other men[^h582]; neither are they plagued[^h5060] like[^h5973] other men[^h120].  
###### 6
Therefore pride[^h1346] compasseth them about as a chain[^h6059]; violence[^h2555] covereth[^h5848] them as a garment[^h7897].
###### 7
Their eyes[^h5869] stand out[^h3318] with fatness[^h2459]: they have more[^h5674] than heart[^h3824] could wish[^h4906]. 
###### 8
They are corrupt[^h4167], and speak[^h1696] wickedly[^h7451] concerning oppression[^h6233]: they speak[^h1696] loftily[^h4791].
###### 9
They set[^h8371] their mouth[^h6310] against the heavens[^h8064], and their tongue[^h3956] walketh[^h1980] through the earth[^h776].
###### 10
Therefore his people[^h5971] return[^h7725] [^h7725] hither[^h1988]: and waters[^h4325] of a full[^h4392] cup are wrung out[^h4680] to them.
###### 11
And they say[^h559], How doth God[^h410] know[^h3045]? and is there[^h3426] knowledge[^h1844] in the most High[^h5945]?
###### 12
Behold, these are the ungodly[^h7563], who prosper[^h7961] in the world[^h5769]; they increase[^h7685] in riches[^h2428].
###### 13
Verily I have cleansed[^h2135] my heart[^h3824] in vain[^h7385], and washed[^h7364] my hands[^h3709] in innocency[^h5356].
###### 14
For all the day[^h3117] long have I been plagued[^h5060], and chastened[^h8433] every morning[^h1242]. 
###### 15
If I say[^h559], I will speak[^h5608] thus[^h3644]; behold, I should offend[^h898] against the generation[^h1755] of thy children[^h1121].
###### 16
When I thought[^h2803] to know[^h3045] this, it was too painful[^h5999] for me[^h5869]; 
###### 17
Until I went[^h935] into the sanctuary[^h4720] of God[^h410]; then understood[^h995] I their end[^h319].
###### 18
Surely thou didst set[^h7896] them in slippery places[^h2513]: thou castedst them down[^h5307] into destruction[^h4876].
###### 19
How are they brought into desolation[^h8047], as in a moment[^h7281]! they are utterly[^h5486] consumed[^h8552] with terrors[^h1091].
###### 20
As a dream[^h2472] when one awaketh[^h6974]; so, O Lord[^h136], when thou awakest[^h5782], thou shalt despise[^h959] their image[^h6754].
###### 21
Thus my heart[^h3824] was grieved[^h2556], and I was pricked[^h8150] in my reins[^h3629].
###### 22
So foolish[^h1198] was I, and ignorant[^h3045]: I was as a beast[^h929] before thee.  
###### 23
Nevertheless I am continually[^h8548] with thee: thou hast holden[^h270] me by my right[^h3225] hand[^h3027].
###### 24
Thou shalt guide[^h5148] me with thy counsel[^h6098], and afterward[^h310] receive[^h3947] me to glory[^h3519].
###### 25
Whom have I in heaven[^h8064] but thee? and there is none upon earth[^h776] that I desire[^h2654] beside thee.
###### 26
My flesh[^h7607] and my heart[^h3824] faileth[^h3615]: but God[^h430] is the strength[^h6697] of my heart[^h3824], and my portion[^h2506] for ever[^h5769]. 
###### 27
For, lo, they that are far[^h7369] from thee shall perish[^h6]: thou hast destroyed[^h6789] all them that go a whoring[^h2181] from thee.
###### 28
But[^h589] it is good[^h2896] for me to draw near[^h7132] to God[^h430]: I have put[^h7896] my trust[^h4268] in the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], that I may declare[^h5608] all thy works[^h4399].

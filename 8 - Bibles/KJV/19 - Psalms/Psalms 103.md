###### 1
A Psalm of David[^h1732]. Bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], O my soul[^h5315]: and all that is within[^h7130] me, bless his holy[^h6944] name[^h8034].
###### 2
Bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], O my soul[^h5315], and forget[^h7911] not all his benefits[^h1576]:
###### 3
Who forgiveth[^h5545] all thine iniquities[^h5771]; who healeth[^h7495] all thy diseases[^h8463];
###### 4
Who redeemeth[^h1350] thy life[^h2416] from destruction[^h7845]; who crowneth[^h5849] thee with lovingkindness[^h2617] and tender mercies[^h7356];
###### 5
Who satisfieth[^h7646] thy mouth[^h5716] with good[^h2896] things; so that thy youth[^h5271] is renewed[^h2318] like the eagle's[^h5404].
###### 6
The LORD[^h3068] executeth[^h6213] righteousness[^h6666] and judgment[^h4941] for all that are oppressed[^h6231].
###### 7
He made known[^h3045] his ways[^h1870] unto Moses[^h4872], his acts[^h5949] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 8
The LORD[^h3068] is merciful[^h7349] and gracious[^h2587], slow[^h750] to anger[^h639], and plenteous[^h7227] in mercy[^h2617]. 
###### 9
He will not always[^h5331] chide[^h7378]: neither will he keep[^h5201] his anger for ever[^h5769].
###### 10
He hath not dealt[^h6213] with us after our sins[^h2399]; nor rewarded[^h1580] us according to our iniquities[^h5771].
###### 11
For as the heaven[^h8064] is high above[^h1361] the earth[^h776], so great[^h1396] is his mercy[^h2617] toward them that fear[^h3373] him. 
###### 12
As far as[^h7368] the east[^h4217] is from the west[^h4628], so far hath he removed[^h7368] our transgressions[^h6588] from us.
###### 13
Like as a father[^h1] pitieth[^h7355] his children[^h1121], so the LORD[^h3068] pitieth[^h7355] them that fear[^h3373] him.
###### 14
For he knoweth[^h3045] our frame[^h3336]; he remembereth[^h2142] that we are dust[^h6083].
###### 15
As for man[^h582], his days[^h3117] are as grass[^h2682]: as a flower[^h6731] of the field[^h7704], so he flourisheth[^h6692].
###### 16
For the wind[^h7307] passeth over[^h5674] it, and it is gone; and the place[^h4725] thereof shall know[^h5234] it no more. 
###### 17
But the mercy[^h2617] of the LORD[^h3068] is from everlasting[^h5769] to[^h5704] everlasting[^h5769] upon them that fear[^h3373] him, and his righteousness[^h6666] unto children's[^h1121] children[^h1121];
###### 18
To such as keep[^h8104] his covenant[^h1285], and to those that remember[^h2142] his commandments[^h6490] to do[^h6213] them.
###### 19
The LORD[^h3068] hath prepared[^h3559] his throne[^h3678] in the heavens[^h8064]; and his kingdom[^h4438] ruleth[^h4910] over all.
###### 20
Bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], ye his angels[^h4397], that excel[^h1368] in strength[^h3581], that do[^h6213] his commandments[^h1697], hearkening[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of his word[^h1697]. 
###### 21
Bless[^h1288] ye the LORD[^h3068], all ye his hosts[^h6635]; ye ministers[^h8334] of his, that do[^h6213] his pleasure[^h7522].
###### 22
Bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], all his works[^h4639] in all places[^h4725] of his dominion[^h4475]: bless[^h1288] the LORD[^h3068], O my soul[^h5315].

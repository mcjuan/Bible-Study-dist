###### 1
A Psalm of David[^h1732]. Fret[^h2734] not thyself because of evildoers[^h7489], neither be thou envious[^h7065] against the workers[^h6213] of iniquity[^h5766].
###### 2
For they shall soon[^h4120] be cut down[^h5243] like the grass[^h2682], and wither[^h5034] as the green[^h3418] herb[^h1877].
###### 3
Trust[^h982] in the LORD[^h3068], and do[^h6213] good[^h2896]; so shalt thou dwell[^h7931] in the land[^h776], and verily[^h530] thou shalt be fed[^h7462]. 
###### 4
Delight[^h6026] thyself also in the LORD[^h3068]; and he shall give[^h5414] thee the desires[^h4862] of thine heart[^h3820].
###### 5
Commit[^h1556] thy way[^h1870] unto the LORD[^h3068]; trust[^h982] also in him; and he shall bring it to pass[^h6213]. 
###### 6
And he shall bring forth[^h3318] thy righteousness[^h6664] as the light[^h216], and thy judgment[^h4941] as the noonday[^h6672].
###### 7
Rest[^h1826] in the LORD[^h3068], and wait patiently[^h2342] for him: fret[^h2734] not thyself because of him who prospereth[^h6743] in his way[^h1870], because of the man[^h376] who bringeth[^h6213] wicked devices[^h4209] to pass[^h6213]. 
###### 8
Cease[^h7503] from anger[^h639], and forsake[^h5800] wrath[^h2534]: fret[^h2734] not thyself in any wise[^h389] to do evil[^h7489].
###### 9
For evildoers[^h7489] shall be cut off[^h3772]: but those that wait[^h6960] upon the LORD[^h3068], they shall inherit[^h3423] the earth[^h776].
###### 10
For yet a little while[^h4592], and the wicked[^h7563] shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider[^h995] his place[^h4725], and it shall not be.
###### 11
But the meek[^h6035] shall inherit[^h3423] the earth[^h776]; and shall delight[^h6026] themselves in the abundance[^h7230] of peace[^h7965].
###### 12
The wicked[^h7563] plotteth[^h2161] against the just[^h6662], and gnasheth[^h2786] upon him with his teeth[^h8127]. 
###### 13
The Lord[^h136] shall laugh[^h7832] at him: for he seeth[^h7200] that his day[^h3117] is coming[^h935].
###### 14
The wicked[^h7563] have drawn out[^h6605] the sword[^h2719], and have bent[^h1869] their bow[^h7198], to cast down[^h5307] the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34], and to slay[^h2873] such as be of upright[^h3477] conversation[^h1870]. 
###### 15
Their sword[^h2719] shall enter[^h935] into their own heart[^h3820], and their bows[^h7198] shall be broken[^h7665].
###### 16
A little[^h4592] that a righteous man[^h6662] hath is better[^h2896] than the riches[^h1995] of many[^h7227] wicked[^h7563].
###### 17
For the arms[^h2220] of the wicked[^h7563] shall be broken[^h7665]: but the LORD[^h3068] upholdeth[^h5564] the righteous[^h6662].
###### 18
The LORD[^h3068] knoweth[^h3045] the days[^h3117] of the upright[^h8549]: and their inheritance[^h5159] shall be for ever[^h5769].
###### 19
They shall not be ashamed[^h954] in the evil[^h7451] time[^h6256]: and in the days[^h3117] of famine[^h7459] they shall be satisfied[^h7646].
###### 20
But the wicked[^h7563] shall perish[^h6], and the enemies[^h341] of the LORD[^h3068] shall be as the fat[^h3368] of lambs[^h3733]: they shall consume[^h3615]; into smoke[^h6227] shall they consume away[^h3615]. 
###### 21
The wicked[^h7563] borroweth[^h3867], and payeth not again[^h7999]: but the righteous[^h6662] sheweth mercy[^h2603], and giveth[^h5414].
###### 22
For such as be blessed[^h1288] of him shall inherit[^h3423] the earth[^h776]; and they that be cursed[^h7043] of him shall be cut off[^h3772].
###### 23
The steps[^h4703] of a good man[^h1397] are ordered[^h3559] by the LORD[^h3068]: and he delighteth[^h2654] in his way[^h1870]. 
###### 24
Though he fall[^h5307], he shall not be utterly cast down[^h2904]: for the LORD[^h3068] upholdeth[^h5564] him with his hand[^h3027].
###### 25
I have been young[^h5288], and now am old[^h2204]; yet have I not seen[^h7200] the righteous[^h6662] forsaken[^h5800], nor his seed[^h2233] begging[^h1245] bread[^h3899].
###### 26
He is ever[^h3117] merciful[^h2603], and lendeth[^h3867]; and his seed[^h2233] is blessed[^h1293]. 
###### 27
Depart[^h5493] from evil[^h7451], and do[^h6213] good[^h2896]; and dwell[^h7931] for evermore[^h5769].
###### 28
For the LORD[^h3068] loveth[^h157] judgment[^h4941], and forsaketh[^h5800] not his saints[^h2623]; they are preserved[^h8104] for ever[^h5769]: but the seed[^h2233] of the wicked[^h7563] shall be cut off[^h3772].
###### 29
The righteous[^h6662] shall inherit[^h3423] the land[^h776], and dwell[^h7931] therein for ever[^h5703].
###### 30
The mouth[^h6310] of the righteous[^h6662] speaketh[^h1897] wisdom[^h2451], and his tongue[^h3956] talketh[^h1696] of judgment[^h4941].
###### 31
The law[^h8451] of his God[^h430] is in his heart[^h3820]; none of his steps[^h838] shall slide[^h4571]. 
###### 32
The wicked[^h7563] watcheth[^h6822] the righteous[^h6662], and seeketh[^h1245] to slay[^h4191] him.
###### 33
The LORD[^h3068] will not leave[^h5800] him in his hand[^h3027], nor condemn[^h7561] him when he is judged[^h8199].
###### 34
Wait[^h6960] on the LORD[^h3068], and keep[^h8104] his way[^h1870], and he shall exalt[^h7311] thee to inherit[^h3423] the land[^h776]: when the wicked[^h7563] are cut off[^h3772], thou shalt see[^h7200] it.
###### 35
I have seen[^h7200] the wicked[^h7563] in great power[^h6184], and spreading[^h6168] himself like a green[^h7488] bay tree[^h249]. 
###### 36
Yet he passed away[^h5674], and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought[^h1245] him, but he could not be found[^h4672].
###### 37
Mark[^h8104] the perfect[^h8535] man, and behold[^h7200] the upright[^h3477]: for the end[^h319] of that man[^h376] is peace[^h7965].
###### 38
But the transgressors[^h6586] shall be destroyed[^h8045] together[^h3162]: the end[^h319] of the wicked[^h7563] shall be cut off[^h3772].
###### 39
But the salvation[^h8668] of the righteous[^h6662] is of the LORD[^h3068]: he is their strength[^h4581] in the time[^h6256] of trouble[^h6869].
###### 40
And the LORD[^h3068] shall help[^h5826] them, and deliver[^h6403] them: he shall deliver[^h6403] them from the wicked[^h7563], and save[^h3467] them, because they trust[^h2620] in him.

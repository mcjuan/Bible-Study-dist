###### 1
O give thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068], for he is good[^h2896]: for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769].
###### 2
Let the redeemed[^h1350] of the LORD[^h3068] say[^h559] so, whom he hath redeemed[^h1350] from the hand[^h3027] of the enemy[^h6862];
###### 3
And gathered[^h6908] them out of the lands[^h776], from the east[^h4217], and from the west[^h4628], from the north[^h6828], and from the south[^h3220]. 
###### 4
They wandered[^h8582] in the wilderness[^h4057] in a solitary[^h3452] way[^h1870]; they found[^h4672] no city[^h5892] to dwell[^h4186] in.
###### 5
Hungry[^h7457] and thirsty[^h6771], their soul[^h5315] fainted[^h5848] in them.
###### 6
Then they cried[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068] in their trouble[^h6862], and he delivered[^h5337] them out of their distresses[^h4691].
###### 7
And he led them forth[^h1869] by the right[^h3477] way[^h1870], that they might go[^h3212] to a city[^h5892] of habitation[^h4186].
###### 8
Oh that men would praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] for his goodness[^h2617], and for his wonderful works[^h6381] to the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]!
###### 9
For he satisfieth[^h7646] the longing[^h8264] soul[^h5315], and filleth[^h4390] the hungry[^h7457] soul[^h5315] with goodness[^h2896].
###### 10
Such as sit[^h3427] in darkness[^h2822] and in the shadow of death[^h6757], being bound[^h615] in affliction[^h6040] and iron[^h1270];
###### 11
Because they rebelled[^h4784] against the words[^h561] of God[^h410], and contemned[^h5006] the counsel[^h6098] of the most High[^h5945]:
###### 12
Therefore he brought down[^h3665] their heart[^h3820] with labour[^h5999]; they fell down[^h3782], and there was none to help[^h5826].
###### 13
Then they cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068] in their trouble[^h6862], and he saved[^h3467] them out of their distresses[^h4691].
###### 14
He brought them out[^h3318] of darkness[^h2822] and the shadow of death[^h6757], and brake[^h5423] their bands[^h4147] in sunder[^h5423].
###### 15
Oh that men would praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] for his goodness[^h2617], and for his wonderful works[^h6381] to the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]!
###### 16
For he hath broken[^h7665] the gates[^h1817] of brass[^h5178], and cut[^h1438] the bars[^h1280] of iron[^h1270] in sunder[^h1438].
###### 17
Fools[^h191] because[^h1870] of their transgression[^h6588], and because of their iniquities[^h5771], are afflicted[^h6031].
###### 18
Their soul[^h5315] abhorreth[^h8581] all manner of meat[^h400]; and they draw near[^h5060] unto the gates[^h8179] of death[^h4194].
###### 19
Then they cry[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068] in their trouble[^h6862], and he saveth[^h3467] them out of their distresses[^h4691].
###### 20
He sent[^h7971] his word[^h1697], and healed[^h7495] them, and delivered[^h4422] them from their destructions[^h7825].
###### 21
Oh that men would praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] for his goodness[^h2617], and for his wonderful works[^h6381] to the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]!
###### 22
And let them sacrifice[^h2076] the sacrifices[^h2077] of thanksgiving[^h8426], and declare[^h5608] his works[^h4639] with rejoicing[^h7440]. 
###### 23
They that go down[^h3381] to the sea[^h3220] in ships[^h591], that do[^h6213] business[^h4399] in great[^h7227] waters[^h4325];
###### 24
These see[^h7200] the works[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068], and his wonders[^h6381] in the deep[^h4688].
###### 25
For he commandeth[^h559], and raiseth[^h5975] the stormy[^h5591] wind[^h7307], which lifteth up[^h7311] the waves[^h1530] thereof. 
###### 26
They mount up[^h5927] to the heaven[^h8064], they go down[^h3381] again to the depths[^h8415]: their soul[^h5315] is melted[^h4127] because of trouble[^h7451].
###### 27
They reel to and fro[^h2287], and stagger[^h5128] like a drunken man[^h7910], and are at their wits'[^h2451] end[^h1104]. 
###### 28
Then they cry[^h6817] unto the LORD[^h3068] in their trouble[^h6862], and he bringeth them out[^h3318] of their distresses[^h4691].
###### 29
He maketh[^h6965] the storm[^h5591] a calm[^h1827], so that the waves[^h1530] thereof are still[^h2814].
###### 30
Then are they glad[^h8055] because they be quiet[^h8367]; so he bringeth[^h5148] them unto their desired[^h2656] haven[^h4231].
###### 31
Oh that men would praise[^h3034] the LORD[^h3068] for his goodness[^h2617], and for his wonderful works[^h6381] to the children[^h1121] of men[^h120]!
###### 32
Let them exalt[^h7311] him also in the congregation[^h6951] of the people[^h5971], and praise[^h1984] him in the assembly[^h4186] of the elders[^h2205].
###### 33
He turneth[^h7760] rivers[^h5104] into a wilderness[^h4057], and the watersprings[^h4325] [^h4161] into dry ground[^h6774];
###### 34
A fruitful[^h6529] land[^h776] into barrenness[^h4420], for the wickedness[^h7451] of them that dwell[^h3427] therein. 
###### 35
He turneth[^h7760] the wilderness[^h4057] into a standing[^h98] water[^h4325], and dry[^h6723] ground[^h776] into watersprings[^h4325] [^h4161].
###### 36
And there he maketh the hungry[^h7457] to dwell[^h3427], that they may prepare[^h3559] a city[^h5892] for habitation[^h4186];
###### 37
And sow[^h2232] the fields[^h7704], and plant[^h5193] vineyards[^h3754], which may yield[^h6213] fruits[^h6529] of increase[^h8393].
###### 38
He blesseth[^h1288] them also, so that they are multiplied[^h7235] greatly[^h3966]; and suffereth[^h4591] not their cattle[^h929] to decrease[^h4591].
###### 39
Again, they are minished[^h4591] and brought low[^h7817] through oppression[^h6115], affliction[^h7451], and sorrow[^h3015].
###### 40
He poureth[^h8210] contempt[^h937] upon princes[^h5081], and causeth them to wander[^h8582] in the wilderness[^h8414], where there is no way[^h1870]. 
###### 41
Yet setteth he the poor[^h34] on high[^h7682] from affliction[^h6040], and maketh[^h7760] him families[^h4940] like a flock[^h6629]. 
###### 42
The righteous[^h3477] shall see[^h7200] it, and rejoice[^h8055]: and all iniquity[^h5766] shall stop[^h7092] her mouth[^h6310].
###### 43
Whoso is wise[^h2450], and will observe[^h8104] these things, even they shall understand[^h995] the lovingkindness[^h2617] of the LORD[^h3068].

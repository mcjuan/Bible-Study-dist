###### 1
O give thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068]; call[^h7121] upon his name[^h8034]: make known[^h3045] his deeds[^h5949] among the people[^h5971].
###### 2
Sing[^h7891] unto him, sing psalms[^h2167] unto him: talk[^h7878] ye of all his wondrous works[^h6381].
###### 3
Glory[^h1984] ye in his holy[^h6944] name[^h8034]: let the heart[^h3820] of them rejoice[^h8055] that seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
Seek[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068], and his strength[^h5797]: seek[^h1245] his face[^h6440] evermore[^h8548].
###### 5
Remember[^h2142] his marvellous works[^h6381] that he hath done[^h6213]; his wonders[^h4159], and the judgments[^h4941] of his mouth[^h6310];
###### 6
O ye seed[^h2233] of Abraham[^h85] his servant[^h5650], ye children[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] his chosen[^h972].
###### 7
He is the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]: his judgments[^h4941] are in all the earth[^h776].
###### 8
He hath remembered[^h2142] his covenant[^h1285] for ever[^h5769], the word[^h1697] which he commanded[^h6680] to a thousand[^h505] generations[^h1755].
###### 9
Which covenant he made[^h3772] with Abraham[^h85], and his oath[^h7621] unto Isaac[^h3446];
###### 10
And confirmed[^h5975] the same unto Jacob[^h3290] for a law[^h2706], and to Israel[^h3478] for an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285]:
###### 11
Saying[^h559], Unto thee will I give[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667], the lot[^h2256] of your inheritance[^h5159]: 
###### 12
When they were but a few men[^h4962] in number[^h4557]; yea, very few[^h4592], and strangers[^h1481] in it.
###### 13
When they went[^h1980] from one nation[^h1471] to another, from one kingdom[^h4467] to another[^h312] people[^h5971];
###### 14
He suffered[^h3240] no man[^h120] to do them wrong[^h6231]: yea, he reproved[^h3198] kings[^h4428] for their sakes;
###### 15
Saying, Touch[^h5060] not mine anointed[^h4899], and do my prophets[^h5030] no harm[^h7489].
###### 16
Moreover he called[^h7121] for a famine[^h7458] upon the land[^h776]: he brake[^h7665] the whole staff[^h4294] of bread[^h3899].
###### 17
He sent[^h7971] a man[^h376] before[^h6440] them, even Joseph[^h3130], who was sold[^h4376] for a servant[^h5650]:
###### 18
Whose feet[^h7272] they hurt[^h6031] with fetters[^h3525]: he[^h5315] was laid[^h935] in iron[^h1270]: 
###### 19
Until the time[^h6256] that his word[^h1697] came[^h935]: the word[^h565] of the LORD[^h3068] tried[^h6884] him.
###### 20
The king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] and loosed[^h5425] him; even the ruler[^h4910] of the people[^h5971], and let him go free[^h6605].
###### 21
He made[^h7760] him lord[^h113] of his house[^h1004], and ruler[^h4910] of all his substance[^h7075]: 
###### 22
To bind[^h631] his princes[^h8269] at his pleasure[^h5315]; and teach his senators[^h2205] wisdom[^h2449].
###### 23
Israel[^h3478] also came[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714]; and Jacob[^h3290] sojourned[^h1481] in the land[^h776] of Ham[^h2526].
###### 24
And he increased[^h6509] his people[^h5971] greatly[^h3966]; and made them stronger[^h6105] than their enemies[^h6862].
###### 25
He turned[^h2015] their heart[^h3820] to hate[^h8130] his people[^h5971], to deal subtilly[^h5230] with his servants[^h5650].
###### 26
He sent[^h7971] Moses[^h4872] his servant[^h5650]; and Aaron[^h175] whom he had chosen[^h977].
###### 27
They shewed[^h7760] his signs[^h226] [^h1697] among them, and wonders[^h4159] in the land[^h776] of Ham[^h2526]. 
###### 28
He sent[^h7971] darkness[^h2822], and made it dark[^h2821]; and they rebelled[^h4784] not against his word[^h1697].
###### 29
He turned[^h2015] their waters[^h4325] into blood[^h1818], and slew[^h4191] their fish[^h1710].
###### 30
Their land[^h776] brought forth[^h8317] frogs[^h6854] in abundance[^h8317], in the chambers[^h2315] of their kings[^h4428].
###### 31
He spake[^h559], and there came[^h935] divers sorts of flies[^h6157], and lice[^h3654] in all their coasts[^h1366].
###### 32
He gave[^h5414] them hail[^h1259] for rain[^h1653], and flaming[^h3852] fire[^h784] in their land[^h776]. 
###### 33
He smote[^h5221] their vines[^h1612] also and their fig trees[^h8384]; and brake[^h7665] the trees[^h6086] of their coasts[^h1366].
###### 34
He spake[^h559], and the locusts[^h697] came[^h935], and caterpillers[^h3218], and that without number[^h4557],
###### 35
And did eat up[^h398] all the herbs[^h6212] in their land[^h776], and devoured[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] of their ground[^h127].
###### 36
He smote[^h5221] also all the firstborn[^h1060] in their land[^h776], the chief[^h7225] of all their strength[^h202].
###### 37
He brought them forth[^h3318] also with silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091]: and there was not one feeble[^h3782] person among their tribes[^h7626].
###### 38
Egypt[^h4714] was glad[^h8055] when they departed[^h3318]: for the fear[^h6343] of them fell[^h5307] upon them.
###### 39
He spread[^h6566] a cloud[^h6051] for a covering[^h4539]; and fire[^h784] to give light[^h215] in the night[^h3915].
###### 40
The people asked[^h7592], and he brought[^h935] quails[^h7958], and satisfied[^h7646] them with the bread[^h3899] of heaven[^h8064].
###### 41
He opened[^h6605] the rock[^h6697], and the waters[^h4325] gushed out[^h2100]; they ran[^h1980] in the dry places[^h6723] like a river[^h5104].
###### 42
For he remembered[^h2142] his holy[^h6944] promise[^h1697], and Abraham[^h85] his servant[^h5650].
###### 43
And he brought forth[^h3318] his people[^h5971] with joy[^h8342], and his chosen[^h972] with gladness[^h7440]: 
###### 44
And gave[^h5414] them the lands[^h776] of the heathen[^h1471]: and they inherited[^h3423] the labour[^h5999] of the people[^h3816];
###### 45
That they might observe[^h8104] his statutes[^h2706], and keep[^h5341] his laws[^h8451]. Praise[^h1984] ye the LORD[^h3050].

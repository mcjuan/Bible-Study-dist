###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329], A Psalm of David[^h1732]. The fool[^h5036] hath said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], There is no God[^h430]. They are corrupt[^h7843], they have done abominable[^h8581] works[^h5949], there is none that doeth[^h6213] good[^h2896].
###### 2
The LORD[^h3068] looked down[^h8259] from heaven[^h8064] upon the children[^h1121] of men[^h120], to see[^h7200] if there[^h3426] were any that did understand[^h7919], and seek[^h1875] God[^h430].
###### 3
They are all gone aside[^h5493], they are all together[^h3162] become filthy[^h444]: there is none that doeth[^h6213] good[^h2896], no, not one[^h259]. 
###### 4
Have all the workers[^h6466] of iniquity[^h205] no knowledge[^h3045]? who eat up[^h398] my people[^h5971] as they eat[^h398] bread[^h3899], and call[^h7121] not upon the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
There were they in great[^h6343] fear[^h6342]: for God[^h430] is in the generation[^h1755] of the righteous[^h6662]. 
###### 6
Ye have shamed[^h954] the counsel[^h6098] of the poor[^h6041], because the LORD[^h3068] is his refuge[^h4268].
###### 7
Oh that[^h5414] the salvation[^h3444] of Israel[^h3478] were come out of Zion[^h6726]! when the LORD[^h3068] bringeth back[^h7725] the captivity[^h7622] of his people[^h5971], Jacob[^h3290] shall rejoice[^h1523], and Israel[^h3478] shall be glad[^h8055].

###### 1
To the chief Musician[^h5329] upon Mahalath[^h4257], Maschil[^h4905], A Psalm of David[^h1732]. The fool[^h5036] hath said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], There is no God[^h430]. Corrupt[^h7843] are they, and have done abominable[^h8581] iniquity[^h5766]: there is none that doeth[^h6213] good[^h2896].
###### 2
God[^h430] looked down[^h8259] from heaven[^h8064] upon the children[^h1121] of men[^h120], to see[^h7200] if there were[^h3426] any that did understand[^h7919], that did seek[^h1875] God[^h430].
###### 3
Every one of them is gone back[^h5472]: they are altogether[^h3162] become filthy[^h444]; there is none that doeth[^h6213] good[^h2896], no, not one[^h259].
###### 4
Have the workers[^h6466] of iniquity[^h205] no knowledge[^h3045]? who eat up[^h398] my people[^h5971] as they eat[^h398] bread[^h3899]: they have not called[^h7121] upon God[^h430].
###### 5
There were they in great[^h6343] fear[^h6342], where no fear[^h6343] was: for God[^h430] hath scattered[^h6340] the bones[^h6106] of him that encampeth[^h2583] against thee: thou hast put them to shame[^h954], because God[^h430] hath despised[^h3988] them. 
###### 6
Oh that[^h5414] the salvation[^h3444] of Israel[^h3478] were come out of Zion[^h6726]! When God[^h430] bringeth back[^h7725] the captivity[^h7622] of his people[^h5971], Jacob[^h3290] shall rejoice[^h1523], and Israel[^h3478] shall be glad[^h8055].

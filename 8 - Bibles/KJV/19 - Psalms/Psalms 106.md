###### 1
Praise[^h1984] ye the LORD[^h3050]. O give thanks[^h3034] unto the LORD[^h3068]; for he is good[^h2896]: for his mercy[^h2617] endureth for ever[^h5769]. 
###### 2
Who can utter[^h4448] the mighty acts[^h1369] of the LORD[^h3068]? who can shew forth[^h8085] all his praise[^h8416]?
###### 3
Blessed[^h835] are they that keep[^h8104] judgment[^h4941], and he that doeth[^h6213] righteousness[^h6666] at all times[^h6256].
###### 4
Remember[^h2142] me, O LORD[^h3068], with the favour[^h7522] that thou bearest unto thy people[^h5971]: O visit[^h6485] me with thy salvation[^h3444];
###### 5
That I may see[^h7200] the good[^h2896] of thy chosen[^h972], that I may rejoice[^h8055] in the gladness[^h8057] of thy nation[^h1471], that I may glory[^h1984] with thine inheritance[^h5159].
###### 6
We have sinned[^h2398] with our fathers[^h1], we have committed iniquity[^h5753], we have done wickedly[^h7561].
###### 7
Our fathers[^h1] understood[^h7919] not thy wonders[^h6381] in Egypt[^h4714]; they remembered[^h2142] not the multitude[^h7230] of thy mercies[^h2617]; but provoked[^h4784] him at the sea[^h3220], even at the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 8
Nevertheless he saved[^h3467] them for his name's[^h8034] sake, that he might make his mighty power[^h1369] to be known[^h3045].
###### 9
He rebuked[^h1605] the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220] also, and it was dried up[^h2717]: so he led[^h3212] them through the depths[^h8415], as through the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 10
And he saved[^h3467] them from the hand[^h3027] of him that hated[^h8130] them, and redeemed[^h1350] them from the hand[^h3027] of the enemy[^h341].
###### 11
And the waters[^h4325] covered[^h3680] their enemies[^h6862]: there was not one[^h259] of them left[^h3498].
###### 12
Then believed[^h539] they his words[^h1697]; they sang[^h7891] his praise[^h8416].
###### 13
They soon[^h4116] forgat[^h7911] his works[^h4639]; they waited[^h2442] not for his counsel[^h6098]: 
###### 14
But lusted[^h183] exceedingly[^h8378] in the wilderness[^h4057], and tempted[^h5254] God[^h410] in the desert[^h3452]. 
###### 15
And he gave[^h5414] them their request[^h7596]; but sent[^h7971] leanness[^h7332] into their soul[^h5315].
###### 16
They envied[^h7065] Moses[^h4872] also in the camp[^h4264], and Aaron[^h175] the saint[^h6918] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
The earth[^h776] opened[^h6605] and swallowed up[^h1104] Dathan[^h1885], and covered[^h3680] the company[^h5712] of Abiram[^h48].
###### 18
And a fire[^h784] was kindled[^h1197] in their company[^h5712]; the flame[^h3852] burned up[^h3857] the wicked[^h7563].
###### 19
They made[^h6213] a calf[^h5695] in Horeb[^h2722], and worshipped[^h7812] the molten image[^h4541].
###### 20
Thus they changed[^h4171] their glory[^h3519] into the similitude[^h8403] of an ox[^h7794] that eateth[^h398] grass[^h6212].
###### 21
They forgat[^h7911] God[^h410] their saviour[^h3467], which had done[^h6213] great things[^h1419] in Egypt[^h4714];
###### 22
Wondrous works[^h6381] in the land[^h776] of Ham[^h2526], and terrible things[^h3372] by the Red[^h5488] sea[^h3220].
###### 23
Therefore he said[^h559] that he would destroy[^h8045] them, had not[^h3884] Moses[^h4872] his chosen[^h972] stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him in the breach[^h6556], to turn away[^h7725] his wrath[^h2534], lest he should destroy[^h7843] them.
###### 24
Yea, they despised[^h3988] the pleasant[^h2532] land[^h776], they believed[^h539] not his word[^h1697]: 
###### 25
But murmured[^h7279] in their tents[^h168], and hearkened[^h8085] not unto the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 26
Therefore he lifted up[^h5375] his hand[^h3027] against them, to overthrow[^h5307] them in the wilderness[^h4057]: 
###### 27
To overthrow[^h5307] their seed[^h2233] also among the nations[^h1471], and to scatter[^h2219] them in the lands[^h776]. 
###### 28
They joined[^h6775] themselves also unto Baalpeor[^h1187], and ate[^h398] the sacrifices[^h2077] of the dead[^h4191].
###### 29
Thus they provoked him to anger[^h3707] with their inventions[^h4611]: and the plague[^h4046] brake in[^h6555] upon them.
###### 30
Then stood up[^h5975] Phinehas[^h6372], and executed judgment[^h6419]: and so the plague[^h4046] was stayed[^h6113].
###### 31
And that was counted[^h2803] unto him for righteousness[^h6666] unto all[^h1755] generations[^h1755] for[^h5704] evermore[^h5769].
###### 32
They angered[^h7107] him also at the waters[^h4325] of strife[^h4808] [^h4809], so that it went ill[^h3415] with Moses[^h4872] for their sakes:
###### 33
Because they provoked[^h4784] his spirit[^h7307], so that he spake unadvisedly[^h981] with his lips[^h8193].
###### 34
They did not destroy[^h8045] the nations[^h5971], concerning whom the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h559] them:
###### 35
But were mingled[^h6148] among the heathen[^h1471], and learned[^h3925] their works[^h4639].
###### 36
And they served[^h5647] their idols[^h6091]: which were a snare[^h4170] unto them.
###### 37
Yea, they sacrificed[^h2076] their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323] unto devils[^h7700],
###### 38
And shed[^h8210] innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818], even the blood[^h1818] of their sons[^h1121] and of their daughters[^h1323], whom they sacrificed[^h2076] unto the idols[^h6091] of Canaan[^h3667]: and the land[^h776] was polluted[^h2610] with blood[^h1818].
###### 39
Thus were they defiled[^h2930] with their own works[^h4639], and went a whoring[^h2181] with their own inventions[^h4611].
###### 40
Therefore was the wrath[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] kindled[^h2734] against his people[^h5971], insomuch that he abhorred[^h8581] his own inheritance[^h5159].
###### 41
And he gave[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of the heathen[^h1471]; and they that hated[^h8130] them ruled[^h4910] over them.
###### 42
Their enemies[^h341] also oppressed[^h3905] them, and they were brought into subjection[^h3665] under their hand[^h3027].
###### 43
Many[^h7227] times[^h6471] did he deliver[^h5337] them; but they provoked[^h4784] him with their counsel[^h6098], and were brought low[^h4355] for their iniquity[^h5771]. 
###### 44
Nevertheless he regarded[^h7200] their affliction[^h6862], when he heard[^h8085] their cry[^h7440]:
###### 45
And he remembered[^h2142] for them his covenant[^h1285], and repented[^h5162] according to the multitude[^h7230] of his mercies[^h2617].
###### 46
He made[^h5414] them also to be pitied[^h7356] of[^h6440] all those that carried them captives[^h7617].
###### 47
Save[^h3467] us, O LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], and gather[^h6908] us from among the heathen[^h1471], to give thanks[^h3034] unto thy holy[^h6944] name[^h8034], and to triumph[^h7623] in thy praise[^h8416].
###### 48
Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] from everlasting[^h5769] to everlasting[^h5769]: and let all the people[^h5971] say[^h559], Amen[^h543]. Praise[^h1984] ye the LORD[^h3050].

###### 1
And it came to pass in the eleventh[^h259] [^h6240] year[^h8141], in the third[^h7992] month, in the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], speak[^h559] unto Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and to his multitude[^h1995]; Whom art thou like[^h1819] in thy greatness[^h1433]?
###### 3
Behold, the Assyrian[^h804] was a cedar[^h730] in Lebanon[^h3844] with fair[^h3303] branches[^h6057], and with a shadowing[^h6751] shroud[^h2793], and of an high[^h1362] stature[^h6967]; and his top[^h6788] was among the thick boughs[^h5688]. 
###### 4
The waters[^h4325] made him great[^h1431], the deep[^h8415] set him up on high[^h7311] with her rivers[^h5104] running[^h1980] round about[^h5439] his plants[^h4302], and sent out[^h7971] her little rivers[^h8585] unto all the trees[^h6086] of the field[^h7704].   
###### 5
Therefore his height[^h6967] was exalted[^h1361] above all the trees[^h6086] of the field[^h7704], and his boughs[^h5634] were multiplied[^h7235], and his branches[^h6288] became long[^h748] because of the multitude[^h7227] of waters[^h4325], when he shot forth[^h7971]. 
###### 6
All the fowls[^h5775] of heaven[^h8064] made their nests[^h7077] in his boughs[^h5589], and under his branches[^h6288] did all the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] bring forth their young[^h3205], and under his shadow[^h6738] dwelt[^h3427] all great[^h7227] nations[^h1471].
###### 7
Thus was he fair[^h3302] in his greatness[^h1433], in the length[^h753] of his branches[^h1808]: for his root[^h8328] was by great[^h7227] waters[^h4325].
###### 8
The cedars[^h730] in the garden[^h1588] of God[^h430] could not hide[^h6004] him: the fir trees[^h1265] were not like[^h1819] his boughs[^h5589], and the chesnut trees[^h6196] were not like his branches[^h6288]; nor any tree[^h6086] in the garden[^h1588] of God[^h430] was like[^h1819] unto him in his beauty[^h3308].
###### 9
I have made[^h6213] him fair[^h3303] by the multitude[^h7230] of his branches[^h1808]: so that all the trees[^h6086] of Eden[^h5731], that were in the garden[^h1588] of God[^h430], envied[^h7065] him.
###### 10
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because thou hast lifted up[^h1361] thyself in height[^h6967], and he hath shot up[^h5414] his top[^h6788] among the thick boughs[^h5688], and his heart[^h3824] is lifted up[^h7311] in his height[^h1363];
###### 11
I have therefore delivered[^h5414] him into the hand[^h3027] of the mighty one[^h410] of the heathen[^h1471]; he shall surely[^h6213] deal[^h6213] with him: I have driven him out[^h1644] for his wickedness[^h7562]. 
###### 12
And strangers[^h2114], the terrible[^h6184] of the nations[^h1471], have cut him off[^h3772], and have left[^h5203] him: upon the mountains[^h2022] and in all the valleys[^h1516] his branches[^h1808] are fallen[^h5307], and his boughs[^h6288] are broken[^h7665] by all the rivers[^h650] of the land[^h776]; and all the people[^h5971] of the earth[^h776] are gone down[^h3381] from his shadow[^h6738], and have left[^h5203] him.
###### 13
Upon his ruin[^h4658] shall all the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064] remain[^h7931], and all the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] shall be upon his branches[^h6288]:
###### 14
To the end that none of all the trees[^h6086] by the waters[^h4325] exalt[^h1361] themselves for their height[^h6967], neither shoot up[^h5414] their top[^h6788] among the thick boughs[^h5688], neither their trees[^h352] stand up[^h5975] in their height[^h1363], all that drink[^h8354] water[^h4325]: for they are all delivered[^h5414] unto death[^h4194], to the nether parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776], in the midst[^h8432] of the children[^h1121] of men[^h120], with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953]. 
###### 15
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; In the day[^h3117] when he went down[^h3381] to the grave[^h7585] I caused a mourning[^h56]: I covered[^h3680] the deep[^h8415] for him, and I restrained[^h4513] the floods[^h5104] thereof, and the great[^h7227] waters[^h4325] were stayed[^h3607]: and I caused Lebanon[^h3844] to mourn[^h6937] for him, and all the trees[^h6086] of the field[^h7704] fainted[^h5969] for him. 
###### 16
I made the nations[^h1471] to shake[^h7493] at the sound[^h6963] of his fall[^h4658], when I cast him down[^h3381] to hell[^h7585] with them that descend[^h3381] into the pit[^h953]: and all the trees[^h6086] of Eden[^h5731], the choice[^h4005] and best[^h2896] of Lebanon[^h3844], all that drink[^h8354] water[^h4325], shall be comforted[^h5162] in the nether parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776].
###### 17
They also went down[^h3381] into hell[^h7585] with him unto them that be slain[^h2491] with the sword[^h2719]; and they that were his arm[^h2220], that dwelt[^h3427] under his shadow[^h6738] in the midst[^h8432] of the heathen[^h1471].
###### 18
To whom art thou thus like[^h1819] in glory[^h3519] and in greatness[^h1433] among the trees[^h6086] of Eden[^h5731]? yet shalt thou be brought down[^h3381] with the trees[^h6086] of Eden[^h5731] unto the nether parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776]: thou shalt lie[^h7901] in the midst[^h8432] of the uncircumcised[^h6189] with them that be slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719]. This is Pharaoh[^h6547] and all his multitude[^h1995], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

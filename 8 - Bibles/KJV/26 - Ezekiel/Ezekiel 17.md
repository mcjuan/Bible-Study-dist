###### 1
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], put forth[^h2330] a riddle[^h2420], and speak[^h4911] a parable[^h4912] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478];
###### 3
And say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; A great[^h1419] eagle[^h5404] with great[^h1419] wings[^h3671], longwinged[^h83] [^h750], full[^h4392] of feathers[^h5133], which had divers colours[^h7553], came[^h935] unto Lebanon[^h3844], and took[^h3947] the highest branch[^h6788] of the cedar[^h730]: 
###### 4
He cropped off[^h6998] the top[^h7218] of his young twigs[^h3242], and carried[^h935] it into a land[^h776] of traffick[^h3667]; he set[^h7760] it in a city[^h5892] of merchants[^h7402].
###### 5
He took[^h3947] also of the seed[^h2233] of the land[^h776], and planted[^h5414] it in a fruitful[^h2233] field[^h7704]; he placed[^h3947] it by great[^h7227] waters[^h4325], and set[^h7760] it as a willow tree[^h6851]. 
###### 6
And it grew[^h6779], and became a spreading[^h5628] vine[^h1612] of low[^h8217] stature[^h6967], whose branches[^h1808] turned[^h6437] toward him, and the roots[^h8328] thereof were under him: so it became a vine[^h1612], and brought forth[^h6213] branches[^h905], and shot[^h7971] forth sprigs[^h6288].
###### 7
There was also another[^h259] great[^h1419] eagle[^h5404] with great[^h1419] wings[^h3671] and many[^h7227] feathers[^h5133]: and, behold, this vine[^h1612] did bend[^h3719] her roots[^h8328] toward him, and shot forth[^h7971] her branches[^h1808] toward him, that he might water[^h8248] it by the furrows[^h6170] of her plantation[^h4302].
###### 8
It was planted[^h8362] in a good[^h2896] soil[^h7704] by great[^h7227] waters[^h4325], that it might bring forth[^h6213] branches[^h6057], and that it might bear[^h5375] fruit[^h6529], that it might be a goodly[^h155] vine[^h1612]. 
###### 9
Say[^h559] thou, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Shall it prosper[^h6743]? shall he not pull up[^h5423] the roots[^h8328] thereof, and cut off[^h7082] the fruit[^h6529] thereof, that it wither[^h3001]? it shall wither[^h3001] in all the leaves[^h2964] of her spring[^h6780], even without great[^h1419] power[^h2220] or many[^h7227] people[^h5971] to pluck it up[^h5375] by the roots[^h8328] thereof.
###### 10
Yea, behold, being planted[^h8362], shall it prosper[^h6743]? shall it not utterly[^h3001] wither[^h3001], when the east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] toucheth[^h5060] it? it shall wither[^h3001] in the furrows[^h6170] where it grew[^h6780].
###### 11
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 12
Say[^h559] now to the rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004], Know[^h3045] ye not what these things mean? tell[^h559] them, Behold, the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] is come[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389], and hath taken[^h3947] the king[^h4428] thereof, and the princes[^h8269] thereof, and led[^h935] them with him to Babylon[^h894];
###### 13
And hath taken[^h3947] of the king's[^h4410] seed[^h2233], and made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with him, and hath taken[^h935] an oath[^h423] of him: he hath also taken[^h3947] the mighty[^h352] of the land[^h776]: 
###### 14
That the kingdom[^h4467] might be base[^h8217], that it might not lift itself up[^h5375], but that by keeping[^h8104] of his covenant[^h1285] it might stand[^h5975]. 
###### 15
But he rebelled[^h4775] against him in sending[^h7971] his ambassadors[^h4397] into Egypt[^h4714], that they might give[^h5414] him horses[^h5483] and much[^h7227] people[^h5971]. Shall he prosper[^h6743]? shall he escape[^h4422] that doeth[^h6213] such things? or shall he break[^h6565] the covenant[^h1285], and be delivered[^h4422]?
###### 16
As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], surely in the place[^h4725] where the king[^h4428] dwelleth that made him king[^h4427], whose oath[^h423] he despised[^h959], and whose covenant[^h1285] he brake[^h6565], even with him in the midst[^h8432] of Babylon[^h894] he shall die[^h4191].
###### 17
Neither shall Pharaoh[^h6547] with his mighty[^h1419] army[^h2428] and great[^h7227] company[^h6951] make[^h6213] for him in the war[^h4421], by casting up[^h8210] mounts[^h5550], and building[^h1129] forts[^h1785], to cut off[^h3772] many[^h7227] persons[^h5315]:
###### 18
Seeing he despised[^h959] the oath[^h423] by breaking[^h6565] the covenant[^h1285], when, lo, he had given[^h5414] his hand[^h3027], and hath done[^h6213] all these things, he shall not escape[^h4422].
###### 19
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; As I live[^h2416], surely mine oath[^h423] that he hath despised[^h959], and my covenant[^h1285] that he hath broken[^h6331], even it will I recompense[^h5414] upon his own head[^h7218].
###### 20
And I will spread[^h6566] my net[^h7568] upon him, and he shall be taken[^h8610] in my snare[^h4686], and I will bring[^h935] him to Babylon[^h894], and will plead[^h8199] with him there for his trespass[^h4603] that he hath trespassed[^h4604] against me.
###### 21
And all his fugitives[^h4015] with all his bands[^h102] shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], and they that remain[^h7604] shall be scattered[^h6566] toward all winds[^h7307]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 22
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will also take[^h3947] of the highest branch[^h6788] of the high[^h7311] cedar[^h730], and will set[^h5414] it; I will crop off[^h6998] from the top[^h7218] of his young twigs[^h3127] a tender one[^h7390], and will plant[^h8362] it upon an high[^h1364] mountain[^h2022] and eminent[^h8524]:
###### 23
In the mountain[^h2022] of the height[^h4791] of Israel[^h3478] will I plant[^h8362] it: and it shall bring forth[^h5375] boughs[^h6057], and bear[^h6213] fruit[^h6529], and be a goodly[^h117] cedar[^h730]: and under it shall dwell[^h7931] all fowl[^h6833] of every wing[^h3671]; in the shadow[^h6738] of the branches[^h1808] thereof shall they dwell[^h7931].
###### 24
And all the trees[^h6086] of the field[^h7704] shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] have brought down[^h8213] the high[^h1364] tree[^h6086], have exalted[^h1361] the low[^h8217] tree[^h6086], have dried[^h3001] up the green[^h3892] tree[^h6086], and have made the dry[^h3002] tree[^h6086] to flourish[^h6524]: I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] and have done[^h6213] it.

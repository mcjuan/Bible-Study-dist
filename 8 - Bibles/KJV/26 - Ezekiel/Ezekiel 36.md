###### 1
Also, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], prophesy[^h5012] unto the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559], Ye mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because the enemy[^h341] hath said[^h559] against you, Aha[^h1889], even the ancient[^h5769] high places[^h1116] are ours in possession[^h4181]:
###### 3
Therefore prophesy[^h5012] and say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because they have made you desolate[^h8074], and swallowed you up[^h7602] on every side[^h5439], that ye might be a possession[^h4181] unto the residue[^h7611] of the heathen[^h1471], and ye are taken up[^h5927] in the lips[^h8193] of talkers[^h3956], and are an infamy[^h1681] of the people[^h5971]:  
###### 4
Therefore, ye mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] to the mountains[^h2022], and to the hills[^h1389], to the rivers[^h650], and to the valleys[^h1516], to the desolate[^h8074] wastes[^h2723], and to the cities[^h5892] that are forsaken[^h5800], which became a prey[^h957] and derision[^h3933] to the residue[^h7611] of the heathen[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439]; 
###### 5
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Surely in the fire[^h784] of my jealousy[^h7068] have I spoken[^h1696] against the residue[^h7611] of the heathen[^h1471], and against all Idumea[^h123], which have appointed[^h5414] my land[^h776] into their possession[^h4181] with the joy[^h8057] of all their heart[^h3824], with despiteful[^h7589] minds[^h5315], to cast it out[^h4054] for a prey[^h957].
###### 6
Prophesy[^h5012] therefore concerning the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto the mountains[^h2022], and to the hills[^h1389], to the rivers[^h650], and to the valleys[^h1516], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I have spoken[^h1696] in my jealousy[^h7068] and in my fury[^h2534], because ye have borne[^h5375] the shame[^h3639] of the heathen[^h1471]:
###### 7
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I have lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027], Surely the heathen[^h1471] that are about[^h5439] you, they shall bear[^h5375] their shame[^h3639].
###### 8
But ye, O mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], ye shall shoot forth[^h5414] your branches[^h6057], and yield[^h5375] your fruit[^h6529] to my people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478]; for they are at hand[^h7126] to come[^h935].
###### 9
For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn[^h6437] unto you, and ye shall be tilled[^h5647] and sown[^h2232]:
###### 10
And I will multiply[^h7235] men[^h120] upon you, all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], even all of it: and the cities[^h5892] shall be inhabited[^h3427], and the wastes[^h2723] shall be builded[^h1129]:
###### 11
And I will multiply[^h7235] upon you man[^h120] and beast[^h929]; and they shall increase[^h7235] and bring fruit[^h6509]: and I will settle[^h3427] you after your old estates[^h6927], and will do better[^h2895] unto you than at your beginnings[^h7221]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 12
Yea, I will cause men[^h120] to walk[^h3212] upon you, even my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478]; and they shall possess[^h3423] thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance[^h5159], and thou shalt no more[^h3254] henceforth bereave[^h7921] them of men.
###### 13
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because they say[^h559] unto you, Thou land devourest up[^h398] men[^h120], and hast bereaved[^h7921] thy nations[^h1471];
###### 14
Therefore thou shalt devour[^h398] men[^h120] no more, neither bereave[^h7921] [^h3782] thy nations[^h1471] any more, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]. 
###### 15
Neither will I cause men to hear[^h8085] in thee the shame[^h3639] of the heathen[^h1471] any more, neither shalt thou bear[^h5375] the reproach[^h2781] of the people[^h5971] any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations[^h1471] to fall[^h3782] any more, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 16
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 17
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], when the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] dwelt[^h3427] in their own land[^h127], they defiled[^h2930] it by their own way[^h1870] and by their doings[^h5949]: their way[^h1870] was before[^h6440] me as the uncleanness[^h2932] of a removed woman[^h5079].
###### 18
Wherefore I poured[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon them for the blood[^h1818] that they had shed[^h8210] upon the land[^h776], and for their idols[^h1544] wherewith they had polluted[^h2930] it:
###### 19
And I scattered[^h6327] them among the heathen[^h1471], and they were dispersed[^h2219] through the countries[^h776]: according to their way[^h1870] and according to their doings[^h5949] I judged[^h8199] them.
###### 20
And when they entered[^h935] unto the heathen[^h1471], whither they went[^h935], they profaned[^h2490] my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034], when they said[^h559] to them, These are the people[^h5971] of the LORD[^h3068], and are gone forth[^h3318] out of his land[^h776].
###### 21
But I had pity[^h2550] for mine holy[^h6944] name[^h8034], which the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] had profaned[^h2490] among the heathen[^h1471], whither they went[^h935].
###### 22
Therefore say[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I do[^h6213] not this for your sakes, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], but for mine holy[^h6944] name's[^h8034] sake, which ye have profaned[^h2490] among the heathen[^h1471], whither ye went[^h935].
###### 23
And I will sanctify[^h6942] my great[^h1419] name[^h8034], which was profaned[^h2490] among the heathen[^h1471], which ye have profaned[^h2490] in the midst[^h8432] of them; and the heathen[^h1471] shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], when I shall be sanctified[^h6942] in you before their eyes[^h5869]. 
###### 24
For I will take[^h3947] you from among[^h4480] the heathen[^h1471], and gather[^h6908] you out of all countries[^h776], and will bring[^h935] you into your own land[^h127].
###### 25
Then will I sprinkle[^h2236] clean[^h2889] water[^h4325] upon you, and ye shall be clean[^h2891]: from all your filthiness[^h2932], and from all your idols[^h1544], will I cleanse[^h2891] you.
###### 26
A new[^h2319] heart[^h3820] also will I give[^h5414] you, and a new[^h2319] spirit[^h7307] will I put[^h5414] within[^h7130] you: and I will take away[^h5493] the stony[^h68] heart[^h3820] out of your flesh[^h1320], and I will give[^h5414] you an heart[^h3820] of flesh[^h1320].
###### 27
And I will put[^h5414] my spirit[^h7307] within[^h7130] you, and cause[^h6213] you to walk[^h3212] in my statutes[^h2706], and ye shall keep[^h8104] my judgments[^h4941], and do[^h6213] them.
###### 28
And ye shall dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] that I gave[^h5414] to your fathers[^h1]; and ye shall be my people[^h5971], and I will be your God[^h430].
###### 29
I will also save[^h3467] you from all your uncleannesses[^h2932]: and I will call[^h7121] for the corn[^h1715], and will increase[^h7235] it, and lay[^h5414] no famine[^h7458] upon you.
###### 30
And I will multiply[^h7235] the fruit[^h6529] of the tree[^h6086], and the increase[^h8570] of the field[^h7704], that ye shall receive[^h3947] no more reproach[^h2781] of famine[^h7458] among the heathen[^h1471].
###### 31
Then shall ye remember[^h2142] your own evil[^h7451] ways[^h1870], and your doings[^h4611] that were not good[^h2896], and shall lothe[^h6962] yourselves in your own sight[^h6440] for your iniquities[^h5771] and for your abominations[^h8441].
###### 32
Not for your sakes do[^h6213] I this, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], be it known[^h3045] unto you: be ashamed[^h954] and confounded[^h3637] for your own ways[^h1870], O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 33
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; In the day[^h3117] that I shall have cleansed[^h2891] you from all your iniquities[^h5771] I will also cause you to dwell[^h3427] in the cities[^h5892], and the wastes[^h2723] shall be builded[^h1129].
###### 34
And the desolate[^h8074] land[^h776] shall be tilled[^h5647], whereas it lay desolate[^h8077] in the sight[^h5869] of all that passed by[^h5674].
###### 35
And they shall say[^h559], This[^h1977] land[^h776] that was desolate[^h8074] is become like the garden[^h1588] of Eden[^h5731]; and the waste[^h2720] and desolate[^h8074] and ruined[^h2040] cities[^h5892] are become fenced[^h1219], and are inhabited[^h3427].
###### 36
Then the heathen[^h1471] that are left[^h7604] round about[^h5439] you shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] build[^h1129] the ruined[^h2040] places, and plant[^h5193] that that was desolate[^h8074]: I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it, and I will do[^h6213] it.
###### 37
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will yet for this be enquired[^h1875] of by the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], to do[^h6213] it for them; I will increase[^h7235] them with men[^h120] like a flock[^h6629].
###### 38
As the holy[^h6944] flock[^h6629], as the flock[^h6629] of Jerusalem[^h3389] in her solemn feasts[^h4150]; so shall the waste[^h2720] cities[^h5892] be filled[^h4392] with flocks[^h6629] of men[^h120]: and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
Afterward he brought[^h935] me to the temple[^h1964], and measured[^h4058] the posts[^h352], six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341] on the one side[^h6311], and six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341] on the other side[^h6311], which was the breadth[^h7341] of the tabernacle[^h168].
###### 2
And the breadth[^h7341] of the door[^h6607] was ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520]; and the sides[^h3802] of the door[^h6607] were five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] on the one side, and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] on the other side: and he measured[^h4058] the length[^h753] thereof, forty[^h705] cubits[^h520]: and the breadth[^h7341], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]. 
###### 3
Then went[^h935] he inward[^h6441], and measured[^h4058] the post[^h352] of the door[^h6607], two[^h8147] cubits[^h520]; and the door[^h6607], six[^h8337] cubits[^h520]; and the breadth[^h7341] of the door[^h6607], seven[^h7651] cubits[^h520].
###### 4
So he measured[^h4058] the length[^h753] thereof, twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]; and the breadth[^h7341], twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520], before[^h6440] the temple[^h1964]: and he said[^h559] unto me, This is the most[^h6944] holy[^h6944] place.
###### 5
After he measured[^h4058] the wall[^h7023] of the house[^h1004], six[^h8337] cubits[^h520]; and the breadth[^h7341] of every side chamber[^h6763], four[^h702] cubits[^h520], round about[^h5439] the house[^h1004] on every side[^h5439].
###### 6
And the side[^h6763] chambers[^h6763] were three[^h7969], one over another[^h6763], and thirty[^h7970] in order[^h6471]; and they entered[^h935] into the wall[^h7023] which was of the house[^h1004] for the side chambers[^h6763] round about[^h5439], that they might have hold[^h270], but they had not hold[^h270] in the wall[^h7023] of the house[^h1004].   
###### 7
And there was an enlarging[^h7337], and a winding about[^h5437] still upward[^h4605] to the side chambers[^h6763]: for the winding about[^h4141] of the house[^h1004] went still upward[^h4605] round about[^h5439] the house[^h1004]: therefore the breadth[^h7341] of the house[^h1004] was still upward[^h4605], and so increased[^h5927] from the lowest[^h8481] chamber to the highest[^h5945] by the midst[^h8484]. 
###### 8
I saw[^h7200] also the height[^h1363] of the house[^h1004] round about[^h5439]: the foundations[^h4328] of the side chambers[^h6763] were a full[^h4393] reed[^h7070] of six[^h8337] great[^h679] cubits[^h520].
###### 9
The thickness[^h7341] of the wall[^h7023], which was for the side chamber[^h6763] without[^h2351], was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520]: and that which was left[^h3240] was the place[^h1004] of the side chambers[^h6763] that were within[^h1004].
###### 10
And between the chambers[^h3957] was the wideness[^h7341] of twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] round about[^h5439] the house[^h1004] on every side[^h5439].
###### 11
And the doors[^h6607] of the side chambers[^h6763] were toward the place that was left[^h3240], one[^h259] door[^h6607] toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828], and another[^h259] door[^h6607] toward the south[^h1864]: and the breadth[^h7341] of the place[^h4725] that was left[^h3240] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] round about[^h5439].
###### 12
Now the building[^h1146] that was before[^h6440] the separate place[^h1508] at the end[^h6285] toward[^h1870] the west[^h3220] was seventy[^h7657] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341]; and the wall[^h7023] of the building[^h1146] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] thick[^h7341] round about[^h5439], and the length[^h753] thereof ninety[^h8673] cubits[^h520].
###### 13
So he measured[^h4058] the house[^h1004], an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] long[^h753]; and the separate place[^h1508], and the building[^h1140], with the walls[^h7023] thereof, an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] long[^h753];
###### 14
Also the breadth[^h7341] of the face[^h6440] of the house[^h1004], and of the separate place[^h1508] toward the east[^h6921], an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520].
###### 15
And he measured[^h4058] the length[^h753] of the building[^h1146] over against[^h6440] the separate place[^h1508] which was behind[^h310] it, and the galleries[^h862] thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520], with the inner[^h6442] temple[^h1964], and the porches[^h197] of the court[^h2691]; 
###### 16
The door posts[^h5592], and the narrow[^h331] windows[^h2474], and the galleries[^h862] round about[^h5439] on their three stories[^h7969], over against[^h5048] the door[^h5592], cieled[^h7824] with wood[^h6086] round about[^h5439], and from the ground[^h776] up to the windows[^h2474], and the windows[^h2474] were covered[^h3680];  
###### 17
To that above the door[^h6607], even unto the inner[^h6442] house[^h1004], and without[^h2351], and by all the wall[^h7023] round about[^h5439] within[^h6442] and without[^h2435], by measure[^h4060]. 
###### 18
And it was made[^h6213] with cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561], so that a palm tree[^h8561] was between a cherub[^h3742] and a cherub[^h3742]; and every cherub[^h3742] had two[^h8147] faces[^h6440];
###### 19
So that the face[^h6440] of a man[^h120] was toward the palm tree[^h8561] on the one side, and the face[^h6440] of a young lion[^h3715] toward the palm tree[^h8561] on the other side: it was made[^h6213] through all the house[^h1004] round about[^h5439].
###### 20
From the ground[^h776] unto above the door[^h6607] were cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561] made[^h6213], and on the wall[^h7023] of the temple[^h1964].
###### 21
The posts[^h4201] of the temple[^h1964] were squared[^h7251], and the face[^h6440] of the sanctuary[^h6944]; the appearance[^h4758] of the one as the appearance[^h4758] of the other. 
###### 22
The altar[^h4196] of wood[^h6086] was three[^h7969] cubits[^h520] high[^h1364], and the length[^h753] thereof two[^h8147] cubits[^h520]; and the corners[^h4740] thereof, and the length[^h753] thereof, and the walls[^h7023] thereof, were of wood[^h6086]: and he said[^h1696] unto me, This is the table[^h7979] that is before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 23
And the temple[^h1964] and the sanctuary[^h6944] had two[^h8147] doors[^h1817].
###### 24
And the doors[^h1817] had two[^h8147] leaves[^h1817] apiece, two[^h8147] turning[^h4142] leaves[^h1817]; two[^h8147] leaves for the one[^h259] door[^h1817], and two[^h8147] leaves[^h1817] for the other[^h312] door.
###### 25
And there were made[^h6213] on them, on the doors[^h1817] of the temple[^h1964], cherubims[^h3742] and palm trees[^h8561], like as were made[^h6213] upon the walls[^h7023]; and there were thick[^h5646] planks[^h6086] upon the face[^h6440] of the porch[^h197] without[^h2351].
###### 26
And there were narrow[^h331] windows[^h2474] and palm trees[^h8561] on the one side and on the other side, on the sides[^h3802] of the porch[^h197], and upon the side chambers[^h6763] of the house[^h1004], and thick planks[^h5646].

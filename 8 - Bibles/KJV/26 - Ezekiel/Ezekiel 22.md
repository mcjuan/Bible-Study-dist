###### 1
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Now, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], wilt thou judge[^h8199], wilt thou judge[^h8199] the bloody[^h1818] city[^h5892]? yea, thou shalt shew[^h3045] her all her abominations[^h8441].   
###### 3
Then say[^h559] thou, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], The city[^h5892] sheddeth[^h8210] blood[^h1818] in the midst[^h8432] of it, that her time[^h6256] may come[^h935], and maketh[^h6213] idols[^h1544] against herself to defile[^h2930] herself.
###### 4
Thou art become guilty[^h816] in thy blood[^h1818] that thou hast shed[^h8210]; and hast defiled[^h2930] thyself in thine idols[^h1544] which thou hast made[^h6213]; and thou hast caused thy days[^h3117] to draw near[^h7126], and art come[^h935] even unto thy years[^h8141]: therefore have I made[^h5414] thee a reproach[^h2781] unto the heathen[^h1471], and a mocking[^h7048] to all countries[^h776].
###### 5
Those that be near[^h7138], and those that be far[^h7350] from thee, shall mock[^h7046] thee, which art infamous[^h2931] [^h8034] and much[^h7227] vexed[^h4103]. 
###### 6
Behold, the princes[^h5387] of Israel[^h3478], every one[^h376] were in thee to their power[^h2220] to shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]. 
###### 7
In thee have they set light[^h7043] by father[^h1] and mother[^h517]: in the midst[^h8432] of thee have they dealt[^h6213] by oppression[^h6233] with the stranger[^h1616]: in thee have they vexed[^h3238] the fatherless[^h3490] and the widow[^h490]. 
###### 8
Thou hast despised[^h959] mine holy things[^h6944], and hast profaned[^h2490] my sabbaths[^h7676].
###### 9
In thee are men[^h582] that carry tales[^h7400] to shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]: and in thee they eat[^h398] upon the mountains[^h2022]: in the midst[^h8432] of thee they commit[^h6213] lewdness[^h2154]. 
###### 10
In thee have they discovered[^h1540] their fathers'[^h1] nakedness[^h6172]: in thee have they humbled[^h6031] her that was set apart[^h5079] for pollution[^h2931].
###### 11
And one[^h376] hath committed[^h6213] abomination[^h8441] with his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802]; and another[^h376] hath lewdly[^h2154] defiled[^h2930] his daughter in law[^h3618]; and another[^h376] in thee hath humbled[^h6031] his sister[^h269], his father's[^h1] daughter[^h1323].   
###### 12
In thee have they taken[^h3947] gifts[^h7810] to shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]; thou hast taken[^h3947] usury[^h5392] and increase[^h8636], and thou hast greedily gained[^h1214] of thy neighbours[^h7453] by extortion[^h6233], and hast forgotten[^h7911] me, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 13
Behold, therefore I have smitten[^h5221] mine hand[^h3709] at thy dishonest gain[^h1215] which thou hast made[^h6213], and at thy blood[^h1818] which hath been in the midst[^h8432] of thee.
###### 14
Can thine heart[^h3820] endure[^h5975], or can thine hands[^h3027] be strong[^h2388], in the days[^h3117] that I shall deal[^h6213] with thee? I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it, and will do[^h6213] it.
###### 15
And I will scatter[^h6327] thee among the heathen[^h1471], and disperse[^h2219] thee in the countries[^h776], and will consume[^h8552] thy filthiness[^h2932] out of thee.
###### 16
And thou shalt take thine inheritance[^h2490] [^h5157] in thyself in the sight[^h5869] of the heathen[^h1471], and thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 17
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 18
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] is to me become dross[^h5509]: all they are brass[^h5178], and tin[^h913], and iron[^h1270], and lead[^h5777], in the midst[^h8432] of the furnace[^h3564]; they are even the dross[^h5509] of silver[^h3701]. 
###### 19
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because ye are all become dross[^h5509], behold, therefore I will gather[^h6908] you into the midst[^h8432] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 20
As they gather[^h6910] silver[^h3701], and brass[^h5178], and iron[^h1270], and lead[^h5777], and tin[^h913], into the midst[^h8432] of the furnace[^h3564], to blow[^h5301] the fire[^h784] upon it, to melt[^h5413] it; so will I gather[^h6908] you in mine anger[^h639] and in my fury[^h2534], and I will leave[^h3240] you there, and melt[^h5413] you. 
###### 21
Yea, I will gather[^h3664] you, and blow[^h5301] upon you in the fire[^h784] of my wrath[^h5678], and ye shall be melted[^h5413] in the midst[^h8432] thereof.
###### 22
As silver[^h3701] is melted[^h2046] in the midst[^h8432] of the furnace[^h3564], so shall ye be melted[^h5413] in the midst[^h8432] thereof; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] have poured out[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon you.
###### 23
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 24
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], say[^h559] unto her, Thou art the land[^h776] that is not cleansed[^h2891], nor rained[^h1656] upon in the day[^h3117] of indignation[^h2195].
###### 25
There is a conspiracy[^h7195] of her prophets[^h5030] in the midst[^h8432] thereof, like a roaring[^h7580] lion[^h738] ravening[^h2963] the prey[^h2964]; they have devoured[^h398] souls[^h5315]; they have taken[^h3947] the treasure[^h2633] and precious things[^h3366]; they have made her many[^h7235] widows[^h490] in the midst[^h8432] thereof.
###### 26
Her priests[^h3548] have violated[^h2554] my law[^h8451], and have profaned[^h2490] mine holy things[^h6944]: they have put no difference[^h914] between the holy[^h6944] and profane[^h2455], neither have they shewed[^h3045] difference between the unclean[^h2931] and the clean[^h2889], and have hid[^h5956] their eyes[^h5869] from my sabbaths[^h7676], and I am profaned[^h2490] among[^h8432] them. 
###### 27
Her princes[^h8269] in the midst[^h7130] thereof are like wolves[^h2061] ravening[^h2963] the prey[^h2964], to shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818], and to destroy[^h6] souls[^h5315], to get[^h1214] dishonest gain[^h1215].
###### 28
And her prophets[^h5030] have daubed[^h2902] them with untempered[^h8602] morter, seeing[^h2374] vanity[^h7723], and divining[^h7080] lies[^h3577] unto them, saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], when the LORD[^h3068] hath not spoken[^h1696].
###### 29
The people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] have used oppression[^h6231] [^h6233], and exercised[^h1497] robbery[^h1498], and have vexed[^h3238] the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34]: yea, they have oppressed[^h6231] the stranger[^h1616] wrongfully[^h4941].  
###### 30
And I sought[^h1245] for a man[^h376] among them, that should make up[^h1443] the hedge[^h1447], and stand[^h5975] in the gap[^h6556] before[^h6440] me for the land[^h776], that I should not destroy[^h7843] it: but I found[^h4672] none.
###### 31
Therefore have I poured out[^h8210] mine indignation[^h2195] upon them; I have consumed[^h3615] them with the fire[^h784] of my wrath[^h5678]: their own way[^h1870] have I recompensed[^h5414] upon their heads[^h7218], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

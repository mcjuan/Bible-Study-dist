###### 1
Then he brought me back[^h7725] the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] of the outward[^h2435] sanctuary[^h4720] which looketh[^h6437] toward the east[^h6921]; and it was shut[^h5462].
###### 2
Then said[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] unto me; This gate[^h8179] shall be shut[^h5462], it shall not be opened[^h6605], and no man[^h376] shall enter[^h935] in by it; because the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], hath entered[^h935] in by it, therefore it shall be shut[^h5462].
###### 3
It is for the prince[^h5387]; the prince[^h5387], he shall sit[^h3427] in it to eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; he shall enter[^h935] by the way[^h1870] of the porch[^h197] of that gate[^h8179], and shall go out[^h3318] by the way[^h1870] of the same.
###### 4
Then brought[^h935] he me the way[^h1870] of the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179] before[^h6440] the house[^h1004]: and I looked[^h7200], and, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and I fell[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440].
###### 5
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], mark[^h7760] well[^h3820], and behold[^h7200] with thine eyes[^h5869], and hear[^h8085] with thine ears[^h241] all that I say[^h1696] unto thee concerning all the ordinances[^h2708] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and all the laws[^h8451] thereof; and mark[^h7760] well[^h3820] the entering in[^h3996] of the house[^h1004], with every going forth[^h4161] of the sanctuary[^h4720].  
###### 6
And thou shalt say[^h559] to the rebellious[^h4805], even to the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; O ye house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], let it suffice[^h7227] you of all your abominations[^h8441],
###### 7
In that ye have brought[^h935] into my sanctuary strangers[^h1121] [^h5236], uncircumcised[^h6189] in heart[^h3820], and uncircumcised[^h6189] in flesh[^h1320], to be in my sanctuary[^h4720], to pollute[^h2490] it, even my house[^h1004], when ye offer[^h7126] my bread[^h3899], the fat[^h2459] and the blood[^h1818], and they have broken[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285] because[^h413] of all your abominations[^h8441]. 
###### 8
And ye have not kept[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of mine holy things[^h6944]: but ye have set[^h7760] keepers[^h8104] of my charge[^h4931] in my sanctuary[^h4720] for yourselves. 
###### 9
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; No stranger[^h1121] [^h5236], uncircumcised[^h6189] in heart[^h3820], nor uncircumcised[^h6189] in flesh[^h1320], shall enter[^h935] into my sanctuary[^h4720], of any stranger that is among[^h8432] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
And the Levites[^h3881] that are gone away far[^h7368] from me, when Israel[^h3478] went astray[^h8582], which went astray away[^h8582] from me after[^h310] their idols[^h1544]; they shall even bear[^h5375] their iniquity[^h5771].
###### 11
Yet they shall be ministers[^h8334] in my sanctuary[^h4720], having charge[^h6486] at the gates[^h8179] of the house[^h1004], and ministering[^h8334] to the house[^h1004]: they shall slay[^h7819] the burnt offering[^h5930] and the sacrifice[^h2077] for the people[^h5971], and they shall stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] them to minister[^h8334] unto them.
###### 12
Because they ministered[^h8334] unto them before[^h6440] their idols[^h1544], and caused the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] to fall[^h4383] into iniquity[^h5771]; therefore have I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] against them, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], and they shall bear[^h5375] their iniquity[^h5771]. 
###### 13
And they shall not come near[^h5066] unto me, to do the office of a priest[^h3547] unto me, nor to come near[^h5066] to any of my holy things[^h6944], in the most holy[^h6944] place: but they shall bear[^h5375] their shame[^h3639], and their abominations[^h8441] which they have committed[^h6213].
###### 14
But I will make[^h5414] them keepers[^h8104] of the charge[^h4931] of the house[^h1004], for all the service[^h5656] thereof, and for all that shall be done[^h6213] therein.
###### 15
But the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881], the sons[^h1121] of Zadok[^h6659], that kept[^h8104] the charge[^h4931] of my sanctuary[^h4720] when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] went astray[^h8582] from me, they shall come near[^h7126] to me to minister[^h8334] unto me, and they shall stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] me to offer[^h7126] unto me the fat[^h2459] and the blood[^h1818], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]:
###### 16
They shall enter[^h935] into my sanctuary[^h4720], and they shall come near[^h7126] to my table[^h7979], to minister[^h8334] unto me, and they shall keep[^h8104] my charge[^h4931].
###### 17
And it shall come to pass, that when they enter[^h935] in at the gates[^h8179] of the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], they shall be clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h6593] garments[^h899]; and no wool[^h6785] shall come[^h5927] upon them, whiles they minister[^h8334] in the gates[^h8179] of the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], and within[^h1004].
###### 18
They shall have linen[^h6593] bonnets[^h6287] upon their heads[^h7218], and shall have linen[^h6593] breeches[^h4370] upon their loins[^h4975]; they shall not gird[^h2296] themselves with any thing that causeth sweat[^h3154]. 
###### 19
And when they go forth[^h3318] into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], even into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691] to the people[^h5971], they shall put off[^h6584] their garments[^h899] wherein they ministered[^h8334], and lay[^h3240] them in the holy[^h6944] chambers[^h3957], and they shall put[^h3847] on other[^h312] garments[^h899]; and they shall not sanctify[^h6942] the people[^h5971] with their garments[^h899].
###### 20
Neither shall they shave[^h1548] their heads[^h7218], nor suffer their locks[^h6545] to grow long[^h7971]; they shall only[^h3697] poll[^h3697] their heads[^h7218].
###### 21
Neither shall any priest[^h3548] drink[^h8354] wine[^h3196], when they enter[^h935] into the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691].
###### 22
Neither shall they take[^h3947] for their wives[^h802] a widow[^h490], nor her that is put away[^h1644]: but they shall take[^h3947] maidens[^h1330] of the seed[^h2233] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], or a widow[^h490] that had a priest[^h3548] before.  
###### 23
And they shall teach[^h3384] my people[^h5971] the difference between the holy[^h6944] and profane[^h2455], and cause them to discern[^h3045] between the unclean[^h2931] and the clean[^h2889].
###### 24
And in controversy[^h7379] they shall stand[^h5975] in judgment[^h8199]; and they shall judge[^h8199] it according to my judgments[^h4941]: and they shall keep[^h8104] my laws[^h8451] and my statutes[^h2708] in all mine assemblies[^h4150]; and they shall hallow[^h6942] my sabbaths[^h7676].
###### 25
And they shall come[^h935] at no dead[^h4191] person[^h120] to defile[^h2930] themselves: but for father[^h1], or for mother[^h517], or for son[^h1121], or for daughter[^h1323], for brother[^h251], or for sister[^h269] that hath had no husband[^h376], they may defile[^h2930] themselves.
###### 26
And after[^h310] he is cleansed[^h2893], they shall reckon[^h5608] unto him seven[^h7651] days[^h3117].
###### 27
And in the day[^h3117] that he goeth[^h935] into the sanctuary[^h6944], unto the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], to minister[^h8334] in the sanctuary[^h6944], he shall offer[^h7126] his sin offering[^h2403], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 28
And it shall be unto them for an inheritance[^h5159]: I am their inheritance[^h5159]: and ye shall give[^h5414] them no possession[^h272] in Israel[^h3478]: I am their possession[^h272].
###### 29
They shall eat[^h398] the meat offering[^h4503], and the sin offering[^h2403], and the trespass offering[^h817]; and every dedicated thing[^h2764] in Israel[^h3478] shall be theirs. 
###### 30
And the first[^h7225] of all the firstfruits[^h1061] of all things, and every oblation[^h8641] of all, of every sort of your oblations[^h8641], shall be the priest's[^h3548]: ye shall also give[^h5414] unto the priest[^h3548] the first[^h7225] of your dough[^h6182], that he may cause the blessing[^h1293] to rest[^h5117] in thine house[^h1004]. 
###### 31
The priests[^h3548] shall not eat[^h398] of any thing that is dead of itself[^h5038], or torn[^h2966], whether it be fowl[^h5775] or beast[^h929].

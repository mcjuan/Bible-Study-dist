###### 1
Moreover he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], eat[^h398] that thou findest[^h4672]; eat[^h398] this roll[^h4039], and go[^h3212] speak[^h1696] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
So I opened[^h6605] my mouth[^h6310], and he caused me to eat[^h398] that roll[^h4039].
###### 3
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], cause thy belly[^h990] to eat[^h398], and fill[^h4390] thy bowels[^h4578] with this roll[^h4039] that I give[^h5414] thee. Then did I eat[^h398] it; and it was in my mouth[^h6310] as honey[^h1706] for sweetness[^h4966].
###### 4
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], go[^h3212], get[^h935] thee unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], and speak[^h1696] with my words[^h1697] unto them.
###### 5
For thou art not sent[^h7971] to a people[^h5971] of a strange[^h6012] speech[^h8193] and of an hard[^h3515] language[^h3956], but to the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; 
###### 6
Not to many[^h7227] people[^h5971] of a strange[^h6012] speech[^h8193] and of an hard[^h3515] language[^h3956], whose words[^h1697] thou canst not understand[^h8085]. Surely, had I sent[^h7971] thee to them, they would have hearkened[^h8085] unto thee.  
###### 7
But the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] will[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto thee; for they will[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto me: for all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] are impudent[^h2389] [^h4696] and hardhearted[^h7186] [^h3820]. 
###### 8
Behold, I have made[^h5414] thy face[^h6440] strong[^h2389] against[^h5980] their faces[^h6440], and thy forehead[^h4696] strong[^h2389] against[^h5980] their foreheads[^h4696].
###### 9
As an adamant[^h8068] harder[^h2389] than flint[^h6864] have I made[^h5414] thy forehead[^h4696]: fear[^h3372] them not, neither be dismayed[^h2865] at their looks[^h6440], though they be a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004].
###### 10
Moreover he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], all my words[^h1697] that I shall speak[^h1696] unto thee receive[^h3947] in thine heart[^h3824], and hear[^h8085] with thine ears[^h241].
###### 11
And go[^h3212], get[^h935] thee to them of the captivity[^h1473], unto the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971], and speak[^h1696] unto them, and tell[^h559] them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; whether they will hear[^h8085], or whether they will forbear[^h2308].
###### 12
Then the spirit[^h7307] took me up[^h5375], and I heard[^h8085] behind[^h310] me a voice[^h6963] of a great[^h1419] rushing[^h7494], saying, Blessed[^h1288] be the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] from his place[^h4725].
###### 13
I heard also the noise[^h6963] of the wings[^h3671] of the living creatures[^h2416] that touched[^h5401] one[^h802] another[^h269], and the noise[^h6963] of the wheels[^h212] over against[^h5980] them, and a noise[^h6963] of a great[^h1419] rushing[^h7494]. 
###### 14
So the spirit[^h7307] lifted me up[^h5375], and took me away[^h3947], and I went[^h3212] in bitterness[^h4751], in the heat[^h2534] of my spirit[^h7307]; but the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was strong[^h2388] upon me.  
###### 15
Then I came[^h935] to them of the captivity[^h1473] at Telabib[^h8512], that dwelt[^h3427] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529], and I sat[^h3427] where they sat[^h3427], and remained[^h3427] there astonished[^h8074] among[^h8432] them seven[^h7651] days[^h3117].
###### 16
And it came to pass at the end[^h7097] of seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 17
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], I have made[^h5414] thee a watchman[^h6822] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]: therefore hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] at my mouth[^h6310], and give them warning[^h2094] from me.
###### 18
When I say[^h559] unto the wicked[^h7563], Thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]; and thou givest him not warning[^h2094], nor speakest[^h1696] to warn[^h2094] the wicked[^h7563] from his wicked[^h7563] way[^h1870], to save his life[^h2421]; the same wicked[^h7563] man shall die[^h4191] in his iniquity[^h5771]; but his blood[^h1818] will I require[^h1245] at thine hand[^h3027].
###### 19
Yet if thou warn[^h2094] the wicked[^h7563], and he turn[^h7725] not from his wickedness[^h7562], nor from his wicked[^h7563] way[^h1870], he shall die[^h4191] in his iniquity[^h5771]; but thou hast delivered[^h5337] thy soul[^h5315].
###### 20
Again[^h7725], When a righteous[^h6662] man doth turn[^h7725] from his righteousness[^h6664], and commit[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766], and I lay[^h5414] a stumblingblock[^h4383] before[^h6440] him, he shall die[^h4191]: because thou hast not given him warning[^h2094], he shall die[^h4191] in his sin[^h2403], and his righteousness[^h6666] which he hath done[^h6213] shall not be remembered[^h2142]; but his blood[^h1818] will I require[^h1245] at thine hand[^h3027]. 
###### 21
Nevertheless if thou warn[^h2094] the righteous[^h6662] man, that the righteous[^h6662] sin[^h2398] not, and he doth not sin[^h2398], he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421], because he is warned[^h2094]; also thou hast delivered[^h5337] thy soul[^h5315].
###### 22
And the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was there upon me; and he said[^h559] unto me, Arise[^h6965], go forth[^h3318] into the plain[^h1237], and I will there talk[^h1696] with thee.
###### 23
Then I arose[^h6965], and went forth[^h3318] into the plain[^h1237]: and, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] stood[^h5975] there, as the glory[^h3519] which I saw[^h7200] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529]: and I fell[^h5307] on my face[^h6440].
###### 24
Then the spirit[^h7307] entered[^h935] into me, and set[^h5975] me upon my feet[^h7272], and spake[^h1696] with me, and said[^h559] unto me, Go[^h935], shut[^h5462] thyself within[^h8432] thine house[^h1004].
###### 25
But thou, O son[^h1121] of man[^h120], behold, they shall put[^h5414] bands[^h5688] upon thee, and shall bind[^h631] thee with them, and thou shalt not go out[^h3318] among[^h8432] them:
###### 26
And I will make thy tongue[^h3956] cleave[^h1692] to the roof of thy mouth[^h2441], that thou shalt be dumb[^h481], and shalt not be to them a reprover[^h376] [^h3198]: for they are a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004]. 
###### 27
But when I speak[^h1696] with[^h854] thee, I will open[^h6605] thy mouth[^h6310], and thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; He that heareth[^h8085], let him hear[^h8085]; and he that forbeareth[^h2310], let him forbear[^h2308]: for they are a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004].

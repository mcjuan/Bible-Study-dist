###### 1
And it came to pass in the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240] year[^h8141], in the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], because that Tyrus[^h6865] hath said[^h559] against Jerusalem[^h3389], Aha[^h1889], she is broken[^h7665] that was the gates[^h1817] of the people[^h5971]: she is turned[^h5437] unto me: I shall be replenished[^h4390], now she is laid waste[^h2717]:
###### 3
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus[^h6865], and will cause many[^h7227] nations[^h1471] to come up[^h5927] against thee, as the sea[^h3220] causeth his waves[^h1530] to come up[^h5927].
###### 4
And they shall destroy[^h7843] the walls[^h2346] of Tyrus[^h6865], and break down[^h2040] her towers[^h4026]: I will also scrape[^h5500] her dust[^h6083] from her, and make[^h5414] her like the top[^h6706] of a rock[^h5553].
###### 5
It shall be a place for the spreading[^h4894] of nets[^h2764] in the midst[^h8432] of the sea[^h3220]: for I have spoken[^h1696] it, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]: and it shall become a spoil[^h957] to the nations[^h1471].
###### 6
And her daughters[^h1323] which are in the field[^h7704] shall be slain[^h2026] by the sword[^h2719]; and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will bring[^h935] upon Tyrus[^h6865] Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], a king[^h4428] of kings[^h4428], from the north[^h6828], with horses[^h5483], and with chariots[^h7393], and with horsemen[^h6571], and companies[^h6951], and much[^h7227] people[^h5971].
###### 8
He shall slay[^h2026] with the sword[^h2719] thy daughters[^h1323] in the field[^h7704]: and he shall make[^h5414] a fort[^h1785] against thee, and cast[^h8210] a mount[^h5550] against thee, and lift up[^h6965] the buckler[^h6793] against thee. 
###### 9
And he shall set[^h5414] engines[^h4239] of war[^h6904] against thy walls[^h2346], and with his axes[^h2719] he shall break down[^h5422] thy towers[^h4026].
###### 10
By reason of the abundance[^h8229] of his horses[^h5483] their dust[^h80] shall cover[^h3680] thee: thy walls[^h2346] shall shake[^h7493] at the noise[^h6963] of the horsemen[^h6571], and of the wheels[^h1534], and of the chariots[^h7393], when he shall enter[^h935] into thy gates[^h8179], as men enter[^h3996] into a city[^h5892] wherein is made a breach[^h1234]. 
###### 11
With the hoofs[^h6541] of his horses[^h5483] shall he tread down[^h7429] all thy streets[^h2351]: he shall slay[^h2026] thy people[^h5971] by the sword[^h2719], and thy strong[^h5797] garrisons[^h4676] shall go down[^h3381] to the ground[^h776].
###### 12
And they shall make a spoil[^h7997] of thy riches[^h2428], and make a prey[^h962] of thy merchandise[^h7404]: and they shall break down[^h2040] thy walls[^h2346], and destroy[^h5422] thy pleasant[^h2532] houses[^h1004]: and they shall lay[^h7760] thy stones[^h68] and thy timber[^h6086] and thy dust[^h6083] in the midst[^h8432] of the water[^h4325]. 
###### 13
And I will cause the noise[^h1995] of thy songs[^h7892] to cease[^h7673]; and the sound[^h6963] of thy harps[^h3658] shall be no more heard[^h8085].
###### 14
And I will make[^h5414] thee like the top[^h6706] of a rock[^h5553]: thou shalt be a place to spread[^h4894] nets[^h2764] upon[^h4894]; thou shalt be built[^h1129] no more: for I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 15
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] to Tyrus[^h6865]; Shall not the isles[^h339] shake[^h7493] at the sound[^h6963] of thy fall[^h4658], when the wounded[^h2491] cry[^h602], when the slaughter[^h2027] is made[^h2026] in the midst[^h8432] of thee?
###### 16
Then all the princes[^h5387] of the sea[^h3220] shall come down[^h3381] from their thrones[^h3678], and lay away[^h5493] their robes[^h4598], and put off[^h6584] their broidered[^h7553] garments[^h899]: they shall clothe[^h3847] themselves with trembling[^h2731]; they shall sit[^h3427] upon the ground[^h776], and shall tremble[^h2729] at every moment[^h7281], and be astonished[^h8074] at thee. 
###### 17
And they shall take up[^h5375] a lamentation[^h7015] for thee, and say[^h559] to thee, How art thou destroyed[^h6], that wast inhabited[^h3427] of seafaring men[^h3220], the renowned[^h1984] city[^h5892], which wast strong[^h2389] in the sea[^h3220], she and her inhabitants[^h3427], which cause[^h5414] their terror[^h2851] to be on all that haunt[^h3427] it! 
###### 18
Now shall the isles[^h339] tremble[^h2729] in the day[^h3117] of thy fall[^h4658]; yea, the isles[^h339] that are in the sea[^h3220] shall be troubled[^h926] at thy departure[^h3318].
###### 19
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; When I shall make[^h5414] thee a desolate[^h2717] city[^h5892], like the cities[^h5892] that are not inhabited[^h3427]; when I shall bring up[^h5927] the deep[^h8415] upon thee, and great[^h7227] waters[^h4325] shall cover[^h3680] thee;
###### 20
When I shall bring thee down[^h3381] with them that descend[^h3381] into the pit[^h953], with the people[^h5971] of old time[^h5769], and shall set[^h3427] thee in the low parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776], in places desolate[^h2723] of old[^h5769], with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953], that thou be not inhabited[^h3427]; and I shall set[^h5414] glory[^h6643] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416];
###### 21
I will make[^h5414] thee a terror[^h1091], and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for[^h1245], yet shalt thou never[^h5769] be found[^h4672] again, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

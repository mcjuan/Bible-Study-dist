###### 1
And it came to pass in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141], in the twelfth month[^h2320], in the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], take up[^h5375] a lamentation[^h7015] for Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and say[^h559] unto him, Thou art like[^h1819] a young lion[^h3715] of the nations[^h1471], and thou art as a whale[^h8577] [^h8565] in the seas[^h3220]: and thou camest forth[^h1518] with thy rivers[^h5104], and troubledst[^h1804] the waters[^h4325] with thy feet[^h7272], and fouledst[^h7515] their rivers[^h5104]. 
###### 3
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will therefore spread out[^h6566] my net[^h7568] over thee with a company[^h6951] of many[^h7227] people[^h5971]; and they shall bring thee up[^h5927] in my net[^h2764].
###### 4
Then will I leave[^h5203] thee upon the land[^h776], I will cast thee forth[^h2904] upon the open[^h6440] field[^h7704], and will cause all the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064] to remain[^h7931] upon thee, and I will fill[^h7646] the beasts[^h2416] of the whole earth[^h776] with thee.
###### 5
And I will lay[^h5414] thy flesh[^h1320] upon the mountains[^h2022], and fill[^h4390] the valleys[^h1516] with thy height[^h7419].
###### 6
I will also water[^h8248] with thy blood[^h1818] the land[^h776] wherein thou swimmest[^h6824], even to the mountains[^h2022]; and the rivers[^h650] shall be full[^h4390] of thee. 
###### 7
And when I shall put thee out[^h3518], I will cover[^h3680] the heaven[^h8064], and make[^h6937] the stars[^h3556] thereof dark[^h6937]; I will cover[^h3680] the sun[^h8121] with a cloud[^h6051], and the moon[^h3394] shall not give[^h215] her light[^h216]. 
###### 8
All the bright[^h3974] lights[^h216] of heaven[^h8064] will I make dark[^h6937] over thee, and set[^h5414] darkness[^h2822] upon thy land[^h776], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].  
###### 9
I will also vex[^h3707] the hearts[^h3820] of many[^h7227] people[^h5971], when I shall bring[^h935] thy destruction[^h7667] among the nations[^h1471], into the countries[^h776] which thou hast not known[^h3045]. 
###### 10
Yea, I will make many[^h7227] people[^h5971] amazed[^h8074] at thee, and their kings[^h4428] shall be horribly[^h8178] afraid[^h8175] for thee, when I shall brandish[^h5774] my sword[^h2719] before them[^h6440]; and they shall tremble[^h2729] at every moment[^h7281], every man[^h376] for his own life[^h5315], in the day[^h3117] of thy fall[^h4658].
###### 11
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; The sword[^h2719] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] shall come[^h935] upon thee.
###### 12
By the swords[^h2719] of the mighty[^h1368] will I cause thy multitude[^h1995] to fall[^h5307], the terrible[^h6184] of the nations[^h1471], all of them: and they shall spoil[^h7703] the pomp[^h1347] of Egypt[^h4714], and all the multitude[^h1995] thereof shall be destroyed[^h8045].
###### 13
I will destroy[^h6] also all the beasts[^h929] thereof from[^h5921] beside the great[^h7227] waters[^h4325]; neither shall the foot[^h7272] of man[^h120] trouble[^h1804] them any more, nor the hoofs[^h6541] of beasts[^h929] trouble[^h1804] them.
###### 14
Then will I make their waters[^h4325] deep[^h8257], and cause their rivers[^h5104] to run[^h3212] like oil[^h8081], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 15
When I shall make[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] desolate[^h8077], and the country[^h776] shall be destitute[^h8074] of that whereof it was full[^h4393], when I shall smite[^h5221] all them that dwell[^h3427] therein, then shall they know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 16
This is the lamentation[^h7015] wherewith they shall lament[^h6969] her: the daughters[^h1323] of the nations[^h1471] shall lament[^h6969] her: they shall lament[^h6969] for her, even for Egypt[^h4714], and for all her multitude[^h1995], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 17
It came to pass also in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141], in the fifteenth[^h2568] [^h6240] day of the month[^h2320], that the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 18
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], wail[^h5091] for the multitude[^h1995] of Egypt[^h4714], and cast them down[^h3381], even her, and the daughters[^h1323] of the famous[^h117] nations[^h1471], unto the nether parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776], with them that go down[^h3381] into the pit[^h953].
###### 19
Whom dost thou pass in beauty[^h5276]? go down[^h3381], and be thou laid[^h7901] with the uncircumcised[^h6189].
###### 20
They shall fall[^h5307] in the midst[^h8432] of them that are slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719]: she is delivered[^h5414] to the sword[^h2719]: draw[^h4900] her and all her multitudes[^h1995]. 
###### 21
The strong[^h410] among the mighty[^h1368] shall speak[^h1696] to him out of the midst[^h8432] of hell[^h7585] with them that help[^h5826] him: they are gone down[^h3381], they lie[^h7901] uncircumcised[^h6189], slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719].
###### 22
Asshur[^h804] is there and all her company[^h6951]: his graves[^h6913] are about[^h5439] him: all of them slain[^h2491], fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]:
###### 23
Whose graves[^h6913] are set[^h5414] in the sides[^h3411] of the pit[^h953], and her company[^h6951] is round about[^h5439] her grave[^h6900]: all of them slain[^h2491], fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], which caused[^h5414] terror[^h2851] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416]. 
###### 24
There is Elam[^h5867] and all her multitude[^h1995] round about[^h5439] her grave[^h6900], all of them slain[^h2491], fallen[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], which are gone down[^h3381] uncircumcised[^h6189] into the nether parts[^h8482] of the earth[^h776], which caused[^h5414] their terror[^h2851] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416]; yet have they borne[^h5375] their shame[^h3639] with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953].
###### 25
They have set[^h5414] her a bed[^h4904] in the midst[^h8432] of the slain[^h2491] with all her multitude[^h1995]: her graves[^h6913] are round about[^h5439] him: all of them uncircumcised[^h6189], slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719]: though their terror[^h2851] was caused[^h5414] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416], yet have they borne[^h5375] their shame[^h3639] with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953]: he is put[^h5414] in the midst[^h8432] of them that be slain[^h2491].
###### 26
There is Meshech[^h4902], Tubal[^h8422], and all her multitude[^h1995]: her graves[^h6913] are round about[^h5439] him: all of them uncircumcised[^h6189], slain[^h2490] by the sword[^h2719], though they caused[^h5414] their terror[^h2851] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416].
###### 27
And they shall not lie[^h7901] with the mighty[^h1368] that are fallen[^h5307] of the uncircumcised[^h6189], which are gone down[^h3381] to hell[^h7585] with their weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421]: and they have laid[^h5414] their swords[^h2719] under their heads[^h7218], but their iniquities[^h5771] shall be upon their bones[^h6106], though they were the terror[^h2851] of the mighty[^h1368] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416]. 
###### 28
Yea, thou shalt be broken[^h7665] in the midst[^h8432] of the uncircumcised[^h6189], and shalt lie[^h7901] with them that are slain[^h2491] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 29
There is Edom[^h123], her kings[^h4428], and all her princes[^h5387], which with their might[^h1369] are laid[^h5414] by them that were slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719]: they shall lie[^h7901] with the uncircumcised[^h6189], and with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953]. 
###### 30
There be the princes[^h5257] of the north[^h6828], all of them, and all the Zidonians[^h6722], which are gone down[^h3381] with the slain[^h2491]; with their terror[^h2851] they are ashamed[^h954] of their might[^h1369]; and they lie[^h7901] uncircumcised[^h6189] with them that be slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719], and bear[^h5375] their shame[^h3639] with them that go down[^h3381] to the pit[^h953].
###### 31
Pharaoh[^h6547] shall see[^h7200] them, and shall be comforted[^h5162] over all his multitude[^h1995], even Pharaoh[^h6547] and all his army[^h2428] slain[^h2491] by the sword[^h2719], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 32
For I have caused[^h5414] my terror[^h2851] in the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416]: and he shall be laid[^h7901] in the midst[^h8432] of the uncircumcised[^h6189] with them that are slain[^h2491] with the sword[^h2719], even Pharaoh[^h6547] and all his multitude[^h1995], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

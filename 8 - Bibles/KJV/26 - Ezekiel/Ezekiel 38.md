###### 1
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], set[^h7760] thy face[^h6440] against Gog[^h1463], the land[^h776] of Magog[^h4031], the chief[^h7218] prince[^h5387] of Meshech[^h4902] and Tubal[^h8422], and prophesy[^h5012] against him, 
###### 3
And say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog[^h1463], the chief[^h7218] prince[^h5387] of Meshech[^h4902] and Tubal[^h8422]:
###### 4
And I will turn thee back[^h7725], and put[^h5414] hooks[^h2397] into thy jaws[^h3895], and I will bring thee forth[^h3318], and all thine army[^h2428], horses[^h5483] and horsemen[^h6571], all of them clothed[^h3847] with all sorts[^h4358] of armour, even a great[^h7227] company[^h6951] with bucklers[^h6793] and shields[^h4043], all of them handling[^h8610] swords[^h2719]:
###### 5
Persia[^h6539], Ethiopia[^h3568], and Libya[^h6316] with them; all of them with shield[^h4043] and helmet[^h3553]: 
###### 6
Gomer[^h1586], and all his bands[^h102]; the house[^h1004] of Togarmah[^h8425] of the north[^h6828] quarters[^h3411], and all his bands[^h102]: and many[^h7227] people[^h5971] with thee.
###### 7
Be thou prepared[^h3559], and prepare[^h3559] for thyself, thou, and all thy company[^h6951] that are assembled[^h6950] unto thee, and be thou a guard[^h4929] unto them.
###### 8
After many[^h7227] days[^h3117] thou shalt be visited[^h6485]: in the latter[^h319] years[^h8141] thou shalt come[^h935] into the land[^h776] that is brought back[^h7725] from the sword[^h2719], and is gathered[^h6908] out of many[^h7227] people[^h5971], against the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], which have been always[^h8548] waste[^h2723]: but it is brought forth[^h3318] out of the nations[^h5971], and they shall dwell[^h3427] safely[^h983] all of them.
###### 9
Thou shalt ascend[^h5927] and come[^h935] like a storm[^h7722], thou shalt be like a cloud[^h6051] to cover[^h3680] the land[^h776], thou, and all thy bands[^h102], and many[^h7227] people[^h5971] with thee.
###### 10
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; It shall also come to pass, that at the same time[^h3117] shall things[^h1697] come[^h5927] into thy mind[^h3824], and thou shalt think[^h2803] an evil[^h7451] thought[^h4284]: 
###### 11
And thou shalt say[^h559], I will go up[^h5927] to the land[^h776] of unwalled villages[^h6519]; I will go[^h935] to them that are at rest[^h8252], that dwell[^h3427] safely[^h983], all of them dwelling[^h3427] without walls[^h2346], and having neither bars[^h1280] nor gates[^h1817], 
###### 12
To take[^h7997] a spoil[^h7998], and to take[^h962] a prey[^h957]; to turn[^h7725] thine hand[^h3027] upon the desolate places[^h2723] that are now inhabited[^h3427], and upon the people[^h5971] that are gathered[^h622] out of the nations[^h1471], which have gotten[^h6213] cattle[^h4735] and goods[^h7075], that dwell[^h3427] in the midst[^h2872] of the land[^h776].  
###### 13
Sheba[^h7614], and Dedan[^h1719], and the merchants[^h5503] of Tarshish[^h8659], with all the young lions[^h3715] thereof, shall say[^h559] unto thee, Art thou come[^h935] to take[^h7997] a spoil[^h7998]? hast thou gathered[^h6950] thy company[^h6951] to take[^h962] a prey[^h957]? to carry away[^h5375] silver[^h3701] and gold[^h2091], to take away[^h3947] cattle[^h4735] and goods[^h7075], to take[^h7997] a great[^h1419] spoil[^h7998]?
###### 14
Therefore, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], prophesy[^h5012] and say[^h559] unto Gog[^h1463], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; In that day[^h3117] when my people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478] dwelleth[^h3427] safely[^h983], shalt thou not know[^h3045] it?
###### 15
And thou shalt come[^h935] from thy place[^h4725] out of the north[^h6828] parts[^h3411], thou, and many[^h7227] people[^h5971] with thee, all of them riding[^h7392] upon horses[^h5483], a great[^h1419] company[^h6951], and a mighty[^h7227] army[^h2428]:
###### 16
And thou shalt come up[^h5927] against my people[^h5971] of Israel[^h3478], as a cloud[^h6051] to cover[^h3680] the land[^h776]; it shall be in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117], and I will bring[^h935] thee against my land[^h776], that the heathen[^h1471] may know[^h3045] me, when I shall be sanctified[^h6942] in thee, O Gog[^h1463], before their eyes[^h5869].
###### 17
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Art thou he of whom I have spoken[^h1696] in old[^h6931] time[^h3117] by[^h3027] my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030] of Israel[^h3478], which prophesied[^h5012] in those days[^h3117] many years[^h8141] that I would bring[^h935] thee against them? 
###### 18
And it shall come to pass at the same time[^h3117] when[^h3117] Gog[^h1463] shall come[^h935] against the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], that my fury[^h2534] shall come up[^h5927] in my face[^h639].
###### 19
For in my jealousy[^h7068] and in the fire[^h784] of my wrath[^h5678] have I spoken[^h1696], Surely in that day[^h3117] there shall be a great[^h1419] shaking[^h7494] in the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478];
###### 20
So that the fishes[^h1709] of the sea[^h3220], and the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064], and the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], and all creeping things[^h7431] that creep[^h7430] upon the earth[^h127], and all the men[^h120] that are upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127], shall shake[^h7493] at my presence[^h6440], and the mountains[^h2022] shall be thrown down[^h2040], and the steep places[^h4095] shall fall[^h5307], and every wall[^h2346] shall fall[^h5307] to the ground[^h776]. 
###### 21
And I will call[^h7121] for a sword[^h2719] against him throughout all my mountains[^h2022], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]: every man's[^h376] sword[^h2719] shall be against his brother[^h251].
###### 22
And I will plead[^h8199] against him with pestilence[^h1698] and with blood[^h1818]; and I will rain[^h4305] upon him, and upon his bands[^h102], and upon the many[^h7227] people[^h5971] that are with him, an overflowing[^h7857] rain[^h1653], and great hailstones[^h417] [^h68], fire[^h784], and brimstone[^h1614].
###### 23
Thus will I magnify[^h1431] myself, and sanctify[^h6942] myself; and I will be known[^h3045] in the eyes[^h5869] of many[^h7227] nations[^h1471], and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].

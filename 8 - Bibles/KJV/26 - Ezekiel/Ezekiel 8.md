###### 1
And it came to pass in the sixth[^h8345] year[^h8141], in the sixth[^h8345] month, in the fifth[^h2568] day of the month[^h2320], as I sat[^h3427] in mine house[^h1004], and the elders[^h2205] of Judah[^h3063] sat[^h3427] before[^h6440] me, that the hand[^h3027] of the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] fell[^h5307] there upon me.
###### 2
Then I beheld[^h7200], and lo a likeness[^h1823] as the appearance[^h4758] of fire[^h784]: from the appearance[^h4758] of his loins[^h4975] even downward[^h4295], fire[^h784]; and from his loins[^h4975] even upward[^h4605], as the appearance[^h4758] of brightness[^h2096], as the colour[^h5869] of amber[^h2830].
###### 3
And he put forth[^h7971] the form[^h8403] of an hand[^h3027], and took[^h3947] me by a lock[^h6734] of mine head[^h7218]; and the spirit[^h7307] lifted me up[^h5375] between the earth[^h776] and the heaven[^h8064], and brought[^h935] me in the visions[^h4759] of God[^h430] to Jerusalem[^h3389], to the door[^h6607] of the inner[^h6442] gate[^h8179] that looketh[^h6437] toward the north[^h6828]; where was the seat[^h4186] of the image[^h5566] of jealousy[^h7068], which provoketh to jealousy[^h7069].
###### 4
And, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] was there, according to the vision[^h4758] that I saw[^h7200] in the plain[^h1237].
###### 5
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], lift up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] now the way[^h1870] toward the north[^h6828]. So I lifted up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869] the way[^h1870] toward the north[^h6828], and behold northward[^h6828] at the gate[^h8179] of the altar[^h4196] this image[^h5566] of jealousy[^h7068] in the entry[^h872].
###### 6
He said[^h559] furthermore unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], seest[^h7200] thou what they do[^h6213]? even the great[^h1419] abominations[^h8441] that the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] committeth[^h6213] here, that I should go far off[^h7368] from my sanctuary[^h4720]? but turn[^h7725] thee yet again, and thou shalt see[^h7200] greater[^h1419] abominations[^h8441].
###### 7
And he brought[^h935] me to the door[^h6607] of the court[^h2691]; and when I looked[^h7200], behold a[^h259] hole[^h2356] in the wall[^h7023].
###### 8
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], dig[^h2864] now in the wall[^h7023]: and when I had digged[^h2864] in the wall[^h7023], behold a[^h259] door[^h6607].
###### 9
And he said[^h559] unto me, Go in[^h935], and behold[^h7200] the wicked[^h7451] abominations[^h8441] that they do[^h6213] here.
###### 10
So I went in[^h935] and saw[^h7200]; and behold every form[^h8403] of creeping things[^h7431], and abominable[^h8263] beasts[^h929], and all the idols[^h1544] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], pourtrayed[^h2707] upon the wall[^h7023] round about[^h5439].
###### 11
And there stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] them seventy[^h7657] men[^h376] of the ancients[^h2205] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], and in the midst[^h8432] of them stood[^h5975] Jaazaniah[^h2970] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], with every man[^h376] his censer[^h4730] in his hand[^h3027]; and a thick[^h6282] cloud[^h6051] of incense[^h7004] went up[^h5927].
###### 12
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], hast thou seen[^h7200] what the ancients[^h2205] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] do[^h6213] in the dark[^h2822], every man[^h376] in the chambers[^h2315] of his imagery[^h4906]? for they say[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] seeth[^h7200] us not; the LORD[^h3068] hath forsaken[^h5800] the earth[^h776].
###### 13
He said[^h559] also unto me, Turn[^h7725] thee yet again, and thou shalt see[^h7200] greater[^h1419] abominations[^h8441] that they do[^h6213].
###### 14
Then he brought[^h935] me to the door[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004] which was toward the north[^h6828]; and, behold, there sat[^h3427] women[^h802] weeping[^h1058] for Tammuz[^h8542].
###### 15
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Hast thou seen[^h7200] this, O son[^h1121] of man[^h120]? turn[^h7725] thee yet again, and thou shalt see[^h7200] greater[^h1419] abominations[^h8441] than these.
###### 16
And he brought[^h935] me into the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004], and, behold, at the door[^h6607] of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], between the porch[^h197] and the altar[^h4196], were about five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] men[^h376], with their backs[^h268] toward the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], and their faces[^h6440] toward the east[^h6924]; and they worshipped[^h7812] the sun[^h8121] toward the east[^h6924].
###### 17
Then he said[^h559] unto me, Hast thou seen[^h7200] this, O son[^h1121] of man[^h120]? Is it a light thing[^h7043] to the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] that they commit[^h6213] the abominations[^h8441] which they commit[^h6213] here? for they have filled[^h4390] the land[^h776] with violence[^h2555], and have returned[^h7725] to provoke me to anger[^h3707]: and, lo, they put[^h7971] the branch[^h2156] to their nose[^h639]. 
###### 18
Therefore will I also deal[^h6213] in fury[^h2534]: mine eye[^h5869] shall not spare[^h2347], neither will I have pity[^h2550]: and though they cry[^h7121] in mine ears[^h241] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], yet will I not hear[^h8085] them.

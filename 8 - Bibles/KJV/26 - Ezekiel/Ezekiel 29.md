###### 1
In the tenth[^h6224] year[^h8141], in the tenth[^h6224] month, in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] day of the month[^h2320], the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], set[^h7760] thy face[^h6440] against Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], and prophesy[^h5012] against him, and against all Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 3
Speak[^h1696], and say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh[^h6547] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714], the great[^h1419] dragon[^h8577] that lieth[^h7257] in the midst[^h8432] of his rivers[^h2975], which hath said[^h559], My river[^h2975] is mine own, and I have made[^h6213] it for myself.
###### 4
But I will put[^h5414] hooks[^h2397] [^h2397] in thy jaws[^h3895], and I will cause the fish[^h1710] of thy rivers[^h2975] to stick[^h1692] unto thy scales[^h7193], and I will bring thee up[^h5927] out of the midst[^h8432] of thy rivers[^h2975], and all the fish[^h1710] of thy rivers[^h2975] shall stick[^h1692] unto thy scales[^h7193].
###### 5
And I will leave[^h5203] thee thrown into the wilderness[^h4057], thee and all the fish[^h1710] of thy rivers[^h2975]: thou shalt fall[^h5307] upon the open[^h6440] fields[^h7704]; thou shalt not be brought together[^h622], nor gathered[^h6908]: I have given[^h5414] thee for meat[^h402] to the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h776] and to the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064]. 
###### 6
And all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Egypt[^h4714] shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], because they have been a staff[^h4938] of reed[^h7070] to the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
When they took hold[^h8610] of thee by thy hand[^h3709], thou didst break[^h7533], and rend[^h1234] all their shoulder[^h3802]: and when they leaned[^h8172] upon thee, thou brakest[^h7665], and madest all their loins[^h4975] to be at a stand[^h5976].
###### 8
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will bring[^h935] a sword[^h2719] upon thee, and cut off[^h3772] man[^h120] and beast[^h929] out of thee.
###### 9
And the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] shall be desolate[^h8077] and waste[^h2723]; and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]: because he hath said[^h559], The river[^h2975] is mine, and I have made[^h6213] it.
###### 10
Behold, therefore I am against thee, and against thy rivers[^h2975], and I will make[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] utterly[^h2721] waste[^h2723] and desolate[^h8077], from the tower[^h4024] of Syene[^h5482] even unto the border[^h1366] of Ethiopia[^h3568].   
###### 11
No foot[^h7272] of man[^h120] shall pass through[^h5674] it, nor foot[^h7272] of beast[^h929] shall pass through[^h5674] it, neither shall it be inhabited[^h3427] forty[^h705] years[^h8141].
###### 12
And I will make[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] desolate[^h8077] in the midst[^h8432] of the countries[^h776] that are desolate[^h8074], and her cities[^h5892] among[^h8432] the cities[^h5892] that are laid waste[^h2717] shall be desolate[^h8077] forty[^h705] years[^h8141]: and I will scatter[^h6327] the Egyptians[^h4714] among the nations[^h1471], and will disperse[^h2219] them through the countries[^h776].
###### 13
Yet thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; At the end[^h7093] of forty[^h705] years[^h8141] will I gather[^h6908] the Egyptians[^h4714] from the people[^h5971] whither they were scattered[^h6327]:
###### 14
And I will bring again[^h7725] the captivity[^h7622] of Egypt[^h4714], and will cause them to return[^h7725] into the land[^h776] of Pathros[^h6624], into the land[^h776] of their habitation[^h4351]; and they shall be there a base[^h8217] kingdom[^h4467].  
###### 15
It shall be the basest[^h8217] of the kingdoms[^h4467]; neither shall it exalt[^h5375] itself any more above the nations[^h1471]: for I will diminish[^h4591] them, that they shall no more rule[^h7287] over the nations[^h1471].
###### 16
And it shall be no more the confidence[^h4009] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], which bringeth[^h2142] their iniquity[^h5771] to remembrance[^h2142], when they shall look[^h6437] after[^h310] them: but they shall know[^h3045] that I am the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 17
And it came to pass in the seven[^h7651] and twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141], in the first[^h7223] month, in the first[^h259] day of the month[^h2320], the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 18
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] caused[^h5647] his army[^h2428] to serve[^h5647] a great[^h1419] service[^h5656] against Tyrus[^h6865]: every head[^h7218] was made bald[^h7139], and every shoulder[^h3802] was peeled[^h4803]: yet had he no wages[^h7939], nor his army[^h2428], for Tyrus[^h6865], for the service[^h5656] that he had served[^h5647] against it:
###### 19
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will give[^h5414] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] unto Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]; and he shall take[^h5375] her multitude[^h1995], and take[^h7997] her spoil[^h7998], and take[^h962] her prey[^h957]; and it shall be the wages[^h7939] for his army[^h2428]. 
###### 20
I have given[^h5414] him the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] for his labour[^h6468] wherewith he served[^h5647] against it, because they wrought[^h6213] for me, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]. 
###### 21
In that day[^h3117] will I cause[^h6779] the horn[^h7161] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] to bud forth[^h6779], and I will give[^h5414] thee the opening[^h6610] of the mouth[^h6310] in the midst[^h8432] of them; and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
The hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon me, and carried me out[^h3318] in the spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068], and set me down[^h5117] in the midst[^h8432] of the valley[^h1237] which was full[^h4392] of bones[^h6106],
###### 2
And caused me to pass[^h5674] by them round about[^h5439]: and, behold, there were very[^h3966] many[^h7227] in the open[^h6440] valley[^h1237]; and, lo, they were very[^h3966] dry[^h3002]. 
###### 3
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], can these bones[^h6106] live[^h2421]? And I answered[^h559], O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], thou knowest[^h3045].
###### 4
Again he said[^h559] unto me, Prophesy[^h5012] upon these bones[^h6106], and say[^h559] unto them, O ye dry[^h3002] bones[^h6106], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] unto these bones[^h6106]; Behold, I will cause breath[^h7307] to enter[^h935] into you, and ye shall live[^h2421]:
###### 6
And I will lay[^h5414] sinews[^h1517] upon you, and will bring up[^h5927] flesh[^h1320] upon you, and cover[^h7159] you with skin[^h5785], and put[^h5414] breath[^h7307] in you, and ye shall live[^h2421]; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
So I prophesied[^h5012] as I was commanded[^h6680]: and as I prophesied[^h5012], there was a noise[^h6963], and behold a shaking[^h7494], and the bones[^h6106] came together[^h7126], bone[^h6106] to his bone[^h6106].
###### 8
And when I beheld[^h7200], lo, the sinews[^h1517] and the flesh[^h1320] came up[^h5927] upon them, and the skin[^h5785] covered[^h7159] them above[^h4605]: but there was no breath[^h7307] in them.
###### 9
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Prophesy[^h5012] unto the wind[^h7307], prophesy[^h5012], son[^h1121] of man[^h120], and say[^h559] to the wind[^h7307], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Come[^h935] from the four[^h702] winds[^h7307], O breath[^h7307], and breathe[^h5301] upon these slain[^h2026], that they may live[^h2421]. 
###### 10
So I prophesied[^h5012] as he commanded[^h6680] me, and the breath[^h7307] came[^h935] into them, and they lived[^h2421], and stood up[^h5975] upon their feet[^h7272], an exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] great[^h1419] army[^h2428].
###### 11
Then he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], these bones[^h6106] are the whole house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]: behold, they say[^h559], Our bones[^h6106] are dried[^h3001], and our hope[^h8615] is lost[^h6]: we are cut off[^h1504] for our parts.
###### 12
Therefore prophesy[^h5012] and say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, O my people[^h5971], I will open[^h6605] your graves[^h6913], and cause you to come up[^h5927] out of your graves[^h6913], and bring[^h935] you into the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 13
And ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I have opened[^h6605] your graves[^h6913], O my people[^h5971], and brought you up[^h5927] out of your graves[^h6913],
###### 14
And shall put[^h5414] my spirit[^h7307] in you, and ye shall live[^h2421], and I shall place[^h3240] you in your own land[^h127]: then shall ye know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it, and performed[^h6213] it, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came again unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 16
Moreover, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], take[^h3947] thee one[^h259] stick[^h6086], and write[^h3789] upon it, For Judah[^h3063], and for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] his companions[^h2270]: then take[^h3947] another[^h259] stick[^h6086], and write[^h3789] upon it, For Joseph[^h3130], the stick[^h6086] of Ephraim[^h669], and for all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] his companions[^h2270]:
###### 17
And join[^h7126] them one[^h259] to another[^h259] into one[^h259] stick[^h6086]; and they shall become one[^h259] in thine hand[^h3027].
###### 18
And when the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971] shall speak[^h559] unto thee, saying[^h559], Wilt thou not shew[^h5046] us what thou meanest by these?
###### 19
Say[^h1696] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will take[^h3947] the stick[^h6086] of Joseph[^h3130], which is in the hand[^h3027] of Ephraim[^h669], and the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] his fellows[^h2270], and will put[^h5414] them with him, even with the stick[^h6086] of Judah[^h3063], and make[^h6213] them one[^h259] stick[^h6086], and they shall be one[^h259] in mine hand[^h3027].
###### 20
And the sticks[^h6086] whereon thou writest[^h3789] shall be in thine hand[^h3027] before their eyes[^h5869].
###### 21
And say[^h1696] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will take[^h3947] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] from among[^h996] the heathen[^h1471], whither they be gone[^h1980], and will gather[^h6908] them on every side[^h5439], and bring[^h935] them into their own land[^h127]:
###### 22
And I will make[^h6213] them one[^h259] nation[^h1471] in the land[^h776] upon the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478]; and one[^h259] king[^h4428] shall be king[^h4428] to them all: and they shall be[^h5750] no more two[^h8147] nations[^h1471], neither shall they be divided[^h2673] into two[^h8147] kingdoms[^h4467] any more at all:
###### 23
Neither shall they defile[^h2930] themselves any more with their idols[^h1544], nor with their detestable things[^h8251], nor with any of their transgressions[^h6588]: but I will save[^h3467] them out of all their dwellingplaces[^h4186], wherein they have sinned[^h2398], and will cleanse[^h2891] them: so shall they be my people[^h5971], and I will be their God[^h430].
###### 24
And David[^h1732] my servant[^h5650] shall be king[^h4428] over them; and they all shall have one[^h259] shepherd[^h7462]: they shall also walk[^h3212] in my judgments[^h4941], and observe[^h8104] my statutes[^h2708], and do[^h6213] them.
###### 25
And they shall dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] that I have given[^h5414] unto Jacob[^h3290] my servant[^h5650], wherein your fathers[^h1] have dwelt[^h3427]; and they shall dwell[^h3427] therein, even they, and their children[^h1121], and their children's[^h1121] children[^h1121] for ever[^h5769]: and my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] shall be their prince[^h5387] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 26
Moreover I will make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] of peace[^h7965] with them; it shall be an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285] with them: and I will place[^h5414] them, and multiply[^h7235] them, and will set[^h5414] my sanctuary[^h4720] in the midst[^h8432] of them for evermore[^h5769].
###### 27
My tabernacle[^h4908] also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God[^h430], and they shall be my people[^h5971].
###### 28
And the heathen[^h1471] shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] do sanctify[^h6942] Israel[^h3478], when my sanctuary[^h4720] shall be in the midst[^h8432] of them for evermore[^h5769].

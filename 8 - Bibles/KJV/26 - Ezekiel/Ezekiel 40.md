###### 1
In the five[^h2568] and twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of our captivity[^h1546], in the beginning[^h7218] of the year[^h8141], in the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], in the fourteenth[^h702] [^h6240] year[^h8141] after[^h310] that the city[^h5892] was smitten[^h5221], in the selfsame[^h6106] day[^h3117] the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon me, and brought[^h935] me thither.
###### 2
In the visions[^h4759] of God[^h430] brought[^h935] he me into the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478], and set[^h5117] me upon a very[^h3966] high[^h1364] mountain[^h2022], by which was as the frame[^h4011] of a city[^h5892] on the south[^h5045]. 
###### 3
And he brought[^h935] me thither, and, behold, there was a man[^h376], whose appearance[^h4758] was like the appearance[^h4758] of brass[^h5178], with a line[^h6616] of flax[^h6593] in his hand[^h3027], and a measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070]; and he stood[^h5975] in the gate[^h8179].
###### 4
And the man[^h376] said[^h1696] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], behold[^h7200] with thine eyes[^h5869], and hear[^h8085] with thine ears[^h241], and set[^h7760] thine heart[^h3820] upon all that I shall shew[^h7200] thee; for to the intent[^h4616] that I might shew[^h7200] them unto thee art thou brought[^h935] hither: declare[^h5046] all that thou seest[^h7200] to the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
And behold a wall[^h2346] on the outside[^h2351] of the house[^h1004] round about[^h5439], and in the man's[^h376] hand[^h3027] a measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070] of six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] long by the cubit[^h520] and an hand breadth[^h2948]: so he measured[^h4058] the breadth[^h7341] of the building[^h1146], one[^h259] reed[^h7070]; and the height[^h6967], one[^h259] reed[^h7070].
###### 6
Then came[^h935] he unto the gate[^h8179] which looketh[^h6440] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921], and went up[^h5927] the stairs[^h4609] thereof, and measured[^h4058] the threshold[^h5592] of the gate[^h8179], which was one[^h259] reed[^h7070] broad[^h7341]; and the other[^h259] threshold[^h5592] of the gate, which was one[^h259] reed[^h7070] broad[^h7341]. 
###### 7
And every little chamber[^h8372] was one[^h259] reed[^h7070] long[^h753], and one[^h259] reed[^h7070] broad[^h7341]; and between the little chambers[^h8372] were five[^h2568] cubits[^h520]; and the threshold[^h5592] of the gate[^h8179] by[^h681] the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179] within[^h1004] was one[^h259] reed[^h7070].
###### 8
He measured[^h4058] also the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179] within[^h1004], one[^h259] reed[^h7070].
###### 9
Then measured[^h4058] he the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179], eight[^h8083] cubits[^h520]; and the posts[^h352] thereof, two[^h8147] cubits[^h520]; and the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179] was inward[^h1004].
###### 10
And the little chambers[^h8372] of the gate[^h8179] eastward[^h1870] [^h6921] were three[^h7969] on this side[^h6311], and three[^h7969] on that side[^h6311]; they three[^h7969] were of one[^h259] measure[^h4060]: and the posts[^h352] had one[^h259] measure[^h4060] on this side and on that side.
###### 11
And he measured[^h4058] the breadth[^h7341] of the entry[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179], ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520]; and the length[^h753] of the gate[^h8179], thirteen[^h7969] [^h6240] cubits[^h520].
###### 12
The space[^h1366] also before[^h6440] the little chambers[^h8372] was one[^h259] cubit[^h520] on this side, and the space[^h1366] was one cubit[^h520] on that side: and the little chambers[^h8372] were six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] on this side, and six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] on that side. 
###### 13
He measured[^h4058] then the gate[^h8179] from the roof[^h1406] of one little chamber[^h8372] to the roof[^h1406] of another: the breadth[^h7341] was five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520], door[^h6607] against door[^h6607].
###### 14
He made[^h6213] also posts[^h352] of threescore[^h8346] cubits[^h520], even unto the post[^h352] of the court[^h2691] round about[^h5439] the gate[^h8179].
###### 15
And from the face[^h6440] of the gate[^h8179] of the entrance[^h2978] unto the face[^h6440] of the porch[^h197] of the inner[^h6442] gate[^h8179] were fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520].
###### 16
And there were narrow[^h331] windows[^h2474] to the little chambers[^h8372], and to their posts[^h352] within[^h6441] the gate[^h8179] round about[^h5439], and likewise to the arches[^h361]: and windows[^h2474] were round about[^h5439] inward[^h6441]: and upon each post[^h352] were palm trees[^h8561].   
###### 17
Then brought[^h935] he me into the outward[^h2435] court[^h2691], and, lo, there were chambers[^h3957], and a pavement[^h7531] made[^h6213] for the court[^h2691] round about[^h5439]: thirty[^h7970] chambers[^h3957] were upon the pavement[^h7531].
###### 18
And the pavement[^h7531] by the side[^h3802] of the gates[^h8179] over against[^h5980] the length[^h753] of the gates[^h8179] was the lower[^h8481] pavement[^h7531].
###### 19
Then he measured[^h4058] the breadth[^h7341] from the forefront[^h6440] of the lower[^h8481] gate[^h8179] unto the forefront[^h6440] of the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] without[^h2351], an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] eastward[^h6921] and northward[^h6828]. 
###### 20
And the gate[^h8179] of the outward[^h2435] court[^h2691] that looked[^h6440] toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828], he measured[^h4058] the length[^h753] thereof, and the breadth[^h7341] thereof. 
###### 21
And the little chambers[^h8372] thereof were three[^h7969] on this side and three[^h7969] on that side; and the posts[^h352] thereof and the arches[^h361] thereof were after the measure[^h4060] of the first[^h7223] gate[^h8179]: the length[^h753] thereof was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520]. 
###### 22
And their windows[^h2474], and their arches[^h361], and their palm trees[^h8561], were after the measure[^h4060] of the gate[^h8179] that looketh[^h6440] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921]; and they went up[^h5927] unto it by seven[^h7651] steps[^h4609]; and the arches[^h361] thereof were before[^h6440] them.
###### 23
And the gate[^h8179] of the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] was over against the gate[^h8179] toward the north[^h6828], and toward the east[^h6921]; and he measured[^h4058] from gate[^h8179] to gate[^h8179] an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520].
###### 24
After that he brought[^h3212] me toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864], and behold a gate[^h8179] toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864]: and he measured[^h4058] the posts[^h352] thereof and the arches[^h361] thereof according to these measures[^h4060].
###### 25
And there were windows[^h2474] in it and in the arches[^h361] thereof round about[^h5439], like those windows[^h2474]: the length[^h753] was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520].
###### 26
And there were seven[^h7651] steps[^h4609] to go up[^h5930] to it, and the arches[^h361] thereof were before[^h6440] them: and it had palm trees[^h8561], one[^h259] on this side, and another[^h259] on that side, upon the posts[^h352] thereof.
###### 27
And there was a gate[^h8179] in the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864]: and he measured[^h4058] from gate[^h8179] to gate[^h8179] toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864] an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520].
###### 28
And he brought[^h935] me to the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] by the south[^h1864] gate[^h8179]: and he measured[^h4058] the south[^h1864] gate[^h8179] according to these measures[^h4060];
###### 29
And the little chambers[^h8372] thereof, and the posts[^h352] thereof, and the arches[^h361] thereof, according to these measures[^h4060]: and there were windows[^h2474] in it and in the arches[^h361] thereof round about[^h5439]: it was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520] long[^h753], and five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341].
###### 30
And the arches[^h361] round about[^h5439] were five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] long[^h753], and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341]. 
###### 31
And the arches[^h361] thereof were toward the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691]; and palm trees[^h8561] were upon the posts[^h352] thereof: and the going up[^h4608] to it had eight[^h8083] steps[^h4609].

And he brought[^h935] me into the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921]: and he measured[^h4058] the gate[^h8179] according to these measures[^h4060].
###### 33
And the little chambers[^h8372] thereof, and the posts[^h352] thereof, and the arches[^h361] thereof, were according to these measures[^h4060]: and there were windows[^h2474] therein and in the arches[^h361] thereof round about[^h5439]: it was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520] long[^h753], and five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341].
###### 34
And the arches[^h361] thereof were toward the outward[^h2435] court[^h2691]; and palm trees[^h8561] were upon the posts[^h352] thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up[^h4608] to it had eight[^h8083] steps[^h4609].
###### 35
And he brought[^h935] me to the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179], and measured[^h4058] it according to these measures[^h4060];
###### 36
The little chambers[^h8372] thereof, the posts[^h352] thereof, and the arches[^h361] thereof, and the windows[^h2474] to it round about[^h5439]: the length[^h753] was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] cubits[^h520].

###### 38
And the chambers[^h3957] and the entries[^h6607] thereof were by the posts[^h352] of the gates[^h8179], where they washed[^h1740] the burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 39
And in the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179] were two[^h8147] tables[^h7979] on this side, and two tables[^h7979] on that side, to slay[^h7819] thereon the burnt offering[^h5930] and the sin offering[^h2403] and the trespass offering[^h817].
###### 40
And at the side[^h3802] without[^h2351], as one goeth up[^h5927] to the entry[^h6607] of the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179], were two[^h8147] tables[^h7979]; and on the other[^h312] side[^h3802], which was at the porch[^h197] of the gate[^h8179], were two[^h8147] tables[^h7979]. 
###### 41
Four[^h702] tables[^h7979] were on this side, and four[^h702] tables[^h7979] on that side, by the side[^h3802] of the gate[^h8179]; eight[^h8083] tables[^h7979], whereupon they slew[^h7819] their sacrifices.
###### 42
And the four[^h702] tables[^h7979] were of hewn[^h1496] stone[^h68] for the burnt offering[^h5930], of a cubit[^h520] and an half[^h2677] long[^h753], and a cubit[^h520] and an half[^h2677] broad[^h7341], and one[^h259] cubit[^h520] high[^h1363]: whereupon also they laid[^h3240] the instruments[^h3627] wherewith they slew[^h7819] the burnt offering[^h5930] and the sacrifice[^h2077].
###### 43

###### 44
And without[^h2351] the inner[^h6442] gate[^h8179] were the chambers[^h3957] of the singers[^h7891] in the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], which was at the side[^h3802] of the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179]; and their prospect[^h6440] was toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864]: one[^h259] at the side[^h3802] of the east[^h6921] gate[^h8179] having the prospect[^h6440] toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828].
###### 45
And he said[^h1696] unto me, This[^h2090] chamber[^h3957], whose prospect[^h6440] is toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864], is for the priests[^h3548], the keepers[^h8104] of the charge[^h4931] of the house[^h1004]. 
###### 46
And the chamber[^h3957] whose prospect[^h6440] is toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828] is for the priests[^h3548], the keepers[^h8104] of the charge[^h4931] of the altar[^h4196]: these are the sons[^h1121] of Zadok[^h6659] among the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], which come near[^h7131] to the LORD[^h3068] to minister[^h8334] unto him.
###### 47
So he measured[^h4058] the court[^h2691], an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] long[^h753], and an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] broad[^h7341], foursquare[^h7251]; and the altar[^h4196] that was before[^h6440] the house[^h1004].
###### 48
And he brought[^h935] me to the porch[^h197] of the house[^h1004], and measured[^h4058] each post[^h352] of the porch[^h197], five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] on this side, and five[^h2568] cubits[^h520] on that side: and the breadth[^h7341] of the gate[^h8179] was three[^h7969] cubits[^h520] on this side, and three[^h7969] cubits[^h520] on that side.

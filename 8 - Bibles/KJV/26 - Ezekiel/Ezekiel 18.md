###### 1
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me again, saying[^h559],
###### 2
What mean ye, that ye use[^h4911] this proverb[^h4912] concerning the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], The fathers[^h1] have eaten[^h398] sour grapes[^h1155], and the children's[^h1121] teeth[^h8127] are set on edge[^h6949]?
###### 3
As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], ye shall not have occasion any more to use[^h4911] this proverb[^h4912] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 4
Behold, all souls[^h5315] are mine; as the soul[^h5315] of the father[^h1], so also the soul[^h5315] of the son[^h1121] is mine: the soul[^h5315] that sinneth[^h2398], it shall die[^h4191].
###### 5
But if a man[^h376] be just[^h6662], and do[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666], 
###### 6
And hath not eaten[^h398] upon the mountains[^h2022], neither hath lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869] to the idols[^h1544] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], neither hath defiled[^h2930] his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802], neither hath come near[^h7126] to a menstruous[^h5079] woman[^h802],
###### 7
And hath not oppressed[^h3238] any[^h376], but hath restored[^h7725] to the debtor[^h2326] his pledge[^h2258], hath spoiled[^h1497] none by violence[^h1500], hath given[^h5414] his bread[^h3899] to the hungry[^h7457], and hath covered[^h3680] the naked[^h5903] with a garment[^h899];
###### 8
He that hath not given forth[^h5414] upon usury[^h5392], neither hath taken[^h3947] any increase[^h8636], that hath withdrawn[^h7725] his hand[^h3027] from iniquity[^h5766], hath executed[^h6213] true[^h571] judgment[^h4941] between man[^h376] and man[^h376],
###### 9
Hath walked[^h1980] in my statutes[^h2708], and hath kept[^h8104] my judgments[^h4941], to deal[^h6213] truly[^h571]; he is just[^h6662], he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 10
If he beget[^h3205] a son[^h1121] that is a robber[^h6530], a shedder[^h8210] of blood[^h1818], and that doeth[^h6213] the like[^h251] to any one[^h259] of these things,  
###### 11
And that doeth[^h6213] not any of those duties, but even hath eaten[^h398] upon the mountains[^h2022], and defiled[^h2930] his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802],
###### 12
Hath oppressed[^h3238] the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34], hath spoiled[^h1497] by violence[^h1500], hath not restored[^h7725] the pledge[^h2258], and hath lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869] to the idols[^h1544], hath committed[^h6213] abomination[^h8441],
###### 13
Hath given forth[^h5414] upon usury[^h5392], and hath taken[^h3947] increase[^h8636]: shall he then live[^h2425]? he shall not live[^h2421]: he hath done[^h6213] all these abominations[^h8441]; he shall surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]; his blood[^h1818] shall be upon him. 
###### 14
Now, lo, if he beget[^h3205] a son[^h1121], that seeth[^h7200] all his father's[^h1] sins[^h2403] which he hath done[^h6213], and considereth[^h7200], and doeth[^h6213] not such like[^h2004],
###### 15
That hath not eaten[^h398] upon the mountains[^h2022], neither hath lifted up[^h5375] his eyes[^h5869] to the idols[^h1544] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], hath not defiled[^h2930] his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802],
###### 16
Neither hath oppressed[^h3238] any[^h376], hath not withholden[^h2254] the pledge[^h2258], neither hath spoiled[^h1497] by violence[^h1500], but hath given[^h5414] his bread[^h3899] to the hungry[^h7457], and hath covered[^h3680] the naked[^h5903] with a garment[^h899], 
###### 17
That hath taken off[^h7725] his hand[^h3027] from the poor[^h6041], that hath not received[^h3947] usury[^h5392] nor increase[^h8636], hath executed[^h6213] my judgments[^h4941], hath walked[^h1980] in my statutes[^h2708]; he shall not die[^h4191] for the iniquity[^h5771] of his father[^h1], he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421].
###### 18
As for his father[^h1], because he cruelly[^h6233] oppressed[^h6231], spoiled[^h1497] his brother[^h251] by violence[^h1499], and did[^h6213] that which is not good[^h2896] among[^h8432] his people[^h5971], lo, even he shall die[^h4191] in his iniquity[^h5771].
###### 19
Yet say[^h559] ye, Why? doth not the son[^h1121] bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of the father[^h1]? When the son[^h1121] hath done[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666], and hath kept[^h8104] all my statutes[^h2708], and hath done[^h6213] them, he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421].
###### 20
The soul[^h5315] that sinneth[^h2398], it shall die[^h4191]. The son[^h1121] shall not bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of the father[^h1], neither shall the father[^h1] bear[^h5375] the iniquity[^h5771] of the son[^h1121]: the righteousness[^h6666] of the righteous[^h6662] shall be upon him, and the wickedness[^h7564] of the wicked[^h7563] shall be upon him.
###### 21
But if the wicked[^h7563] will turn[^h7725] from all his sins[^h2403] that he hath committed[^h6213], and keep[^h8104] all my statutes[^h2708], and do[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666], he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421], he shall not die[^h4191].
###### 22
All his transgressions[^h6588] that he hath committed[^h6213], they shall not be mentioned[^h2142] unto him: in his righteousness[^h6666] that he hath done[^h6213] he shall live[^h2421].
###### 23
Have I any pleasure[^h2654] at all[^h2654] that the wicked[^h7563] should die[^h4194]? saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]: and not that he should return[^h7725] from his ways[^h1870], and live[^h2421]?
###### 24
But when the righteous[^h6662] turneth away[^h7725] from his righteousness[^h6666], and committeth[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766], and doeth[^h6213] according to all the abominations[^h8441] that the wicked[^h7563] man doeth[^h6213], shall he live[^h2425]? All his righteousness[^h6666] that he hath done[^h6213] shall not be mentioned[^h2142]: in his trespass[^h4603] that he hath trespassed[^h4604], and in his sin[^h2403] that he hath sinned[^h2398], in them shall he die[^h4191].
###### 25
Yet ye say[^h559], The way[^h1870] of the Lord[^h136] is not equal[^h8505]. Hear[^h8085] now, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; Is not my way[^h1870] equal[^h8505]? are not your ways[^h1870] unequal[^h8505]?
###### 26
When a righteous[^h6662] man turneth away[^h7725] from his righteousness[^h6666], and committeth[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766], and dieth[^h4191] in them; for his iniquity[^h5766] that he hath done[^h6213] shall he die[^h4191].
###### 27
Again, when the wicked[^h7563] man turneth away[^h7725] from his wickedness[^h7564] that he hath committed[^h6213], and doeth[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666], he shall save[^h2421] his soul[^h5315] alive[^h2421].
###### 28
Because he considereth[^h7200], and turneth away[^h7725] from all his transgressions[^h6588] that he hath committed[^h6213], he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421], he shall not die[^h4191].
###### 29
Yet saith[^h559] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], The way[^h1870] of the Lord[^h136] is not equal[^h8505]. O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], are not my ways[^h1870] equal[^h8505]? are not your ways[^h1870] unequal[^h8505]?
###### 30
Therefore I will judge[^h8199] you, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], every one[^h376] according to his ways[^h1870], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]. Repent[^h7725], and turn[^h7725] yourselves from all your transgressions[^h6588]; so iniquity[^h5771] shall not be your ruin[^h4383]. 
###### 31
Cast away[^h7993] from you all your transgressions[^h6588], whereby ye have transgressed[^h6586]; and make[^h6213] you a new[^h2319] heart[^h3820] and a new[^h2319] spirit[^h7307]: for why will ye die[^h4191], O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 32
For I have no pleasure[^h2654] in the death[^h4194] of him that dieth[^h4191], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]: wherefore turn[^h7725] yourselves, and live[^h2421] ye.

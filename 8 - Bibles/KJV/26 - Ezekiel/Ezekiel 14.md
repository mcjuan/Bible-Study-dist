###### 1
Then came[^h935] certain[^h582] of the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] unto me, and sat[^h3427] before[^h6440] me.
###### 2
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 3
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], these men[^h582] have set up[^h5927] their idols[^h1544] in their heart[^h3820], and put[^h5414] the stumblingblock[^h4383] of their iniquity[^h5771] before[^h5227] their face[^h6440]: should I be enquired[^h1875] of at all[^h1875] by them?
###### 4
Therefore speak[^h1696] unto them, and say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Every man[^h376] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] that setteth up[^h5927] his idols[^h1544] in his heart[^h3820], and putteth[^h7760] the stumblingblock[^h4383] of his iniquity[^h5771] before[^h5227] his face[^h6440], and cometh[^h935] to the prophet[^h5030]; I the LORD[^h3068] will answer[^h6030] him that cometh[^h935] according to the multitude[^h7230] of his idols[^h1544];
###### 5
That I may take[^h8610] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] in their own heart[^h3820], because they are all estranged[^h2114] from me through their idols[^h1544].
###### 6
Therefore say[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Repent[^h7725], and turn[^h7725] yourselves from your idols[^h1544]; and turn away[^h7725] your faces[^h6440] from all your abominations[^h8441]. 
###### 7
For every one[^h376] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], or of the stranger[^h1616] that sojourneth[^h1481] in Israel[^h3478], which separateth[^h5144] himself from me[^h310], and setteth up[^h5927] his idols[^h1544] in his heart[^h3820], and putteth[^h7760] the stumblingblock[^h4383] of his iniquity[^h5771] before[^h5227] his face[^h6440], and cometh[^h935] to a prophet[^h5030] to enquire[^h1875] of him concerning me; I the LORD[^h3068] will answer[^h6030] him by myself:
###### 8
And I will set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] against that man[^h376], and will make[^h8074] him a sign[^h226] and a proverb[^h4912], and I will cut him off[^h3772] from the midst[^h8432] of my people[^h5971]; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And if the prophet[^h5030] be deceived[^h6601] when he hath spoken[^h1696] a thing[^h1697], I the LORD[^h3068] have deceived[^h6601] that prophet[^h5030], and I will stretch out[^h5186] my hand[^h3027] upon him, and will destroy[^h8045] him from the midst[^h8432] of my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478].
###### 10
And they shall bear[^h5375] the punishment of their iniquity[^h5771]: the punishment[^h5771] of the prophet[^h5030] shall be even as the punishment[^h5771] of him that seeketh[^h1875] unto him;
###### 11
That the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] may go no more astray[^h8582] from me[^h310], neither be polluted[^h2930] any more with all their transgressions[^h6588]; but that they may be my people[^h5971], and I may be their God[^h430], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 12
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came again to me, saying[^h559],
###### 13
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], when the land[^h776] sinneth[^h2398] against me by trespassing[^h4603] grievously[^h4604], then will I stretch out[^h5186] mine hand[^h3027] upon it, and will break[^h7665] the staff[^h4294] of the bread[^h3899] thereof, and will send[^h7971] famine[^h7458] upon it, and will cut off[^h3772] man[^h120] and beast[^h929] from it:
###### 14
Though these three[^h7969] men[^h582], Noah[^h5146], Daniel[^h1840], and Job[^h347], were in it[^h8432], they should deliver[^h5337] but their own souls[^h5315] by their righteousness[^h6666], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 15
If[^h3863] I cause noisome[^h7451] beasts[^h2416] to pass through[^h5674] the land[^h776], and they spoil[^h7921] it, so that it be desolate[^h8077], that no man may pass through[^h5674] because[^h6440] of the beasts[^h2416]: 
###### 16
Though these three[^h7969] men[^h582] were in it[^h8432], as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], they shall deliver[^h5337] neither sons[^h1121] nor daughters[^h1323]; they only shall be delivered[^h5337], but the land[^h776] shall be desolate[^h8077]. 
###### 17
Or if I bring[^h935] a sword[^h2719] upon that land[^h776], and say[^h559], Sword[^h2719], go through[^h5674] the land[^h776]; so that I cut off[^h3772] man[^h120] and beast[^h929] from it:
###### 18
Though these three[^h7969] men[^h582] were in it[^h8432], as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], they shall deliver[^h5337] neither sons[^h1121] nor daughters[^h1323], but they only shall be delivered[^h5337] themselves.
###### 19
Or if I send[^h7971] a pestilence[^h1698] into that land[^h776], and pour out[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon it in blood[^h1818], to cut off[^h3772] from it man[^h120] and beast[^h929]:
###### 20
Though Noah[^h5146], Daniel[^h1840], and Job[^h347], were in it[^h8432], as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], they shall deliver[^h5337] neither son[^h1121] nor[^h518] daughter[^h1323]; they shall but deliver[^h5337] their own souls[^h5315] by their righteousness[^h6666].
###### 21
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; How much more when I send[^h7971] my four[^h702] sore[^h7451] judgments[^h8201] upon Jerusalem[^h3389], the sword[^h2719], and the famine[^h7458], and the noisome[^h7451] beast[^h2416], and the pestilence[^h1698], to cut off[^h3772] from it man[^h120] and beast[^h929]? 
###### 22
Yet, behold, therein shall be left[^h3498] a remnant[^h6413] that shall be brought forth[^h3318], both sons[^h1121] and daughters[^h1323]: behold, they shall come forth[^h3318] unto you, and ye shall see[^h7200] their way[^h1870] and their doings[^h5949]: and ye shall be comforted[^h5162] concerning the evil[^h7451] that I have brought[^h935] upon Jerusalem[^h3389], even concerning all that I have brought[^h935] upon it.
###### 23
And they shall comfort[^h5162] you, when ye see[^h7200] their ways[^h1870] and their doings[^h5949]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I have not done[^h6213] without cause[^h2600] all that I have done[^h6213] in it, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

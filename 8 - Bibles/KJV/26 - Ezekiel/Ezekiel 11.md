###### 1
Moreover the spirit[^h7307] lifted me up[^h5375], and brought[^h935] me unto the east[^h6931] gate[^h8179] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004], which looketh[^h6437] eastward[^h6921]: and behold at the door[^h6607] of the gate[^h8179] five[^h2568] and twenty[^h6242] men[^h376]; among[^h8432] whom I saw[^h7200] Jaazaniah[^h2970] the son[^h1121] of Azur[^h5809], and Pelatiah[^h6410] the son[^h1121] of Benaiah[^h1141], princes[^h8269] of the people[^h5971].
###### 2
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], these are the men[^h582] that devise[^h2803] mischief[^h205], and give[^h3289] wicked[^h7451] counsel[^h6098] in this city[^h5892]:
###### 3
Which say[^h559], It is not near[^h7138]; let us build[^h1129] houses[^h1004]: this city is the caldron[^h5518], and we be the flesh[^h1320]. 
###### 4
Therefore prophesy[^h5012] against them, prophesy[^h5012], O son[^h1121] of man[^h120].
###### 5
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] fell[^h5307] upon me, and said[^h559] unto me, Speak[^h559]; Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Thus have ye said[^h559], O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]: for I know[^h3045] the things that come[^h4609] into your mind[^h7307], every one of them.
###### 6
Ye have multiplied[^h7235] your slain[^h2491] in this city[^h5892], and ye have filled[^h4390] the streets[^h2351] thereof with the slain[^h2491].
###### 7
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Your slain[^h2491] whom ye have laid[^h7760] in the midst[^h8432] of it, they are the flesh[^h1320], and this city is the caldron[^h5518]: but I will bring you forth[^h3318] out of the midst[^h8432] of it.
###### 8
Ye have feared[^h3372] the sword[^h2719]; and I will bring[^h935] a sword[^h2719] upon you, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 9
And I will bring you out[^h3318] of the midst[^h8432] thereof, and deliver[^h5414] you into the hands[^h3027] of strangers[^h2114], and will execute[^h6213] judgments[^h8201] among you.
###### 10
Ye shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]; I will judge[^h8199] you in the border[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
This city shall not be your caldron[^h5518], neither shall ye be the flesh[^h1320] in the midst[^h8432] thereof; but I will judge[^h8199] you in the border[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 12
And ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]: for ye have not walked[^h1980] in my statutes[^h2706], neither executed[^h6213] my judgments[^h4941], but have done[^h6213] after the manners[^h4941] of the heathen[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] you. 
###### 13
And it came to pass, when I prophesied[^h5012], that Pelatiah[^h6410] the son[^h1121] of Benaiah[^h1141] died[^h4191]. Then fell I down[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440], and cried[^h2199] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], and said[^h559], Ah[^h162] Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]! wilt thou make[^h6213] a full end[^h3617] of the remnant[^h7611] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 14
Again the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 15
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], thy brethren[^h251], even thy brethren[^h251], the men[^h582] of thy kindred[^h1353], and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] have said[^h559], Get you far[^h7368] from the LORD[^h3068]: unto us is this land[^h776] given[^h5414] in possession[^h4181].
###### 16
Therefore say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Although I have cast them far off[^h7368] among the heathen[^h1471], and although I have scattered[^h6327] them among the countries[^h776], yet will I be to them as a little[^h4592] sanctuary[^h4720] in the countries[^h776] where they shall come[^h935].
###### 17
Therefore say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will even gather[^h6908] you from the people[^h5971], and assemble[^h622] you out of the countries[^h776] where ye have been scattered[^h6327], and I will give[^h5414] you the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 18
And they shall come[^h935] thither, and they shall take away[^h5493] all the detestable things[^h8251] thereof and all the abominations[^h8441] thereof from thence.
###### 19
And I will give[^h5414] them one[^h259] heart[^h3820], and I will put[^h5414] a new[^h2319] spirit[^h7307] within[^h7130] you; and I will take[^h5493] the stony[^h68] heart[^h3820] out of their flesh[^h1320], and will give[^h5414] them an heart[^h3820] of flesh[^h1320]:
###### 20
That they may walk[^h3212] in my statutes[^h2708], and keep[^h8104] mine ordinances[^h4941], and do[^h6213] them: and they shall be my people[^h5971], and I will be their God[^h430].
###### 21
But as for them whose heart[^h3820] walketh[^h1980] after the heart[^h3820] of their detestable things[^h8251] and their abominations[^h8441], I will recompense[^h5414] their way[^h1870] upon their own heads[^h7218], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 22
Then did the cherubims[^h3742] lift up[^h5375] their wings[^h3671], and the wheels[^h212] beside[^h5980] them; and the glory[^h3519] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] was over them above[^h4605].
###### 23
And the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] went up[^h5927] from the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892], and stood[^h5975] upon the mountain[^h2022] which is on the east side[^h6924] of the city[^h5892].
###### 24
Afterwards the spirit[^h7307] took me up[^h5375], and brought[^h935] me in a vision[^h4758] by the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] into Chaldea[^h3778], to them of the captivity[^h1473]. So the vision[^h4758] that I had seen[^h7200] went up[^h5927] from me.
###### 25
Then I spake[^h1696] unto them of the captivity[^h1473] all the things[^h1697] that the LORD[^h3068] had shewed[^h7200] me.

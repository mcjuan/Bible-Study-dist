###### 1
And thou, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], take[^h3947] thee a sharp[^h2299] knife[^h2719], take[^h3947] thee a barber's[^h1532] razor[^h8593], and cause it to pass[^h5674] upon thine head[^h7218] and upon thy beard[^h2206]: then take[^h3947] thee balances[^h3976] to weigh[^h4948], and divide[^h2505] the hair.
###### 2
Thou shalt burn[^h1197] with fire[^h217] a third part[^h7992] in the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892], when the days[^h3117] of the siege[^h4692] are fulfilled[^h4390]: and thou shalt take[^h3947] a third part[^h7992], and smite[^h5221] about[^h5439] it with a knife[^h2719]: and a third part[^h7992] thou shalt scatter[^h2219] in the wind[^h7307]; and I will draw out[^h7324] a sword[^h2719] after[^h310] them.
###### 3
Thou shalt also take[^h3947] thereof a few[^h4592] in number[^h4557], and bind[^h6696] them in thy skirts[^h3671]. 
###### 4
Then take of them again[^h3947], and cast[^h7993] them into the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784], and burn[^h8313] them in the fire[^h784]; for thereof shall a fire[^h784] come forth[^h3318] into all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 5
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; This is Jerusalem[^h3389]: I have set[^h7760] it in the midst[^h8432] of the nations[^h1471] and countries[^h776] that are round about[^h5439] her.
###### 6
And she hath changed[^h4784] my judgments[^h4941] into wickedness[^h7564] more than the nations[^h1471], and my statutes[^h2708] more than the countries[^h776] that are round about[^h5439] her: for they have refused[^h3988] my judgments[^h4941] and my statutes[^h2708], they have not walked[^h1980] in them.
###### 7
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because ye multiplied[^h1995] more than the nations[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] you, and have not walked[^h1980] in my statutes[^h2708], neither have kept[^h6213] my judgments[^h4941], neither have done[^h6213] according to the judgments[^h4941] of the nations[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] you;
###### 8
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute[^h6213] judgments[^h4941] in the midst[^h8432] of thee in the sight[^h5869] of the nations[^h1471].
###### 9
And I will do[^h6213] in thee that which I have not done[^h6213], and whereunto I will not do[^h6213] any more the like, because[^h3282] of all thine abominations[^h8441].
###### 10
Therefore the fathers[^h1] shall eat[^h398] the sons[^h1121] in the midst[^h8432] of thee, and the sons[^h1121] shall eat[^h398] their fathers[^h1]; and I will execute[^h6213] judgments[^h8201] in thee, and the whole remnant[^h7611] of thee will I scatter[^h2219] into all the winds[^h7307].
###### 11
Wherefore, as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Surely, because thou hast defiled[^h2930] my sanctuary[^h4720] with all thy detestable things[^h8251], and with all thine abominations[^h8441], therefore will I also diminish[^h1639] thee; neither shall mine eye[^h5869] spare[^h2347], neither will I have any pity[^h2550].
###### 12
A third part[^h7992] of thee shall die[^h4191] with the pestilence[^h1698], and with famine[^h7458] shall they be consumed[^h3615] in the midst[^h8432] of thee: and a third part[^h7992] shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719] round about[^h5439] thee; and I will scatter[^h2219] a third part[^h7992] into all the winds[^h7307], and I will draw out[^h7324] a sword[^h2719] after[^h310] them.
###### 13
Thus shall mine anger[^h639] be accomplished[^h3615], and I will cause my fury[^h2534] to rest[^h5117] upon them, and I will be comforted[^h5162]: and they shall know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it in my zeal[^h7068], when I have accomplished[^h3615] my fury[^h2534] in them.
###### 14
Moreover I will make[^h5414] thee waste[^h2723], and a reproach[^h2781] among the nations[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] thee, in the sight[^h5869] of all that pass by[^h5674].
###### 15
So it shall be a reproach[^h2781] and a taunt[^h1422], an instruction[^h4148] and an astonishment[^h4923] unto the nations[^h1471] that are round about[^h5439] thee, when I shall execute[^h6213] judgments[^h8201] in thee in anger[^h639] and in fury[^h2534] and in furious[^h2534] rebukes[^h8433]. I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 16
When I shall send[^h7971] upon them the evil[^h7451] arrows[^h2671] of famine[^h7458], which shall be for their destruction[^h4889], and which I will send[^h7971] to destroy[^h7843] you: and I will increase[^h3254] the famine[^h7458] upon you, and will break[^h7665] your staff[^h4294] of bread[^h3899]:
###### 17
So will I send[^h7971] upon you famine[^h7458] and evil[^h7451] beasts[^h2416], and they shall bereave[^h7921] thee; and pestilence[^h1698] and blood[^h1818] shall pass through[^h5674] thee; and I will bring[^h935] the sword[^h2719] upon thee. I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it.

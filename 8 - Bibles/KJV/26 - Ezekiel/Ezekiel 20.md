###### 1
And it came to pass in the seventh[^h7637] year[^h8141], in the fifth[^h2549] month, the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], that certain[^h582] of the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] to enquire[^h1875] of the LORD[^h3068], and sat[^h3427] before[^h6440] me.
###### 2
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 3
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], speak[^h1696] unto the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Are ye come[^h935] to enquire[^h1875] of me? As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], I will not be enquired[^h1875] of by you.
###### 4
Wilt thou judge[^h8199] them, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], wilt thou judge[^h8199] them? cause them to know[^h3045] the abominations[^h8441] of their fathers[^h1]: 
###### 5
And say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; In the day[^h3117] when I chose[^h977] Israel[^h3478], and lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] unto the seed[^h2233] of the house[^h1004] of Jacob[^h3290], and made myself known[^h3045] unto them in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], when I lifted[^h5375] up mine hand[^h3027] unto them, saying[^h559], I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; 
###### 6
In the day[^h3117] that I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] unto them, to bring them forth[^h3318] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] into a land[^h776] that I had espied[^h8446] for them, flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], which is the glory[^h6643] of all lands[^h776]:
###### 7
Then said[^h559] I unto them, Cast ye away[^h7993] every man[^h376] the abominations[^h8251] of his eyes[^h5869], and defile[^h2930] not yourselves with the idols[^h1544] of Egypt[^h4714]: I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 8
But they rebelled[^h4784] against me, and would[^h14] not hearken[^h8085] unto me: they did not every man[^h376] cast away[^h7993] the abominations[^h8251] of their eyes[^h5869], neither did they forsake[^h5800] the idols[^h1544] of Egypt[^h4714]: then I said[^h559], I will pour out[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon them, to accomplish[^h3615] my anger[^h639] against them in the midst[^h8432] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 9
But I wrought[^h6213] for my name's[^h8034] sake, that it should not be polluted[^h2490] before[^h5869] the heathen[^h1471], among[^h8432] whom they were, in whose sight[^h5869] I made myself known[^h3045] unto them, in bringing them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 10
Wherefore I caused them to go forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and brought[^h935] them into the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 11
And I gave[^h5414] them my statutes[^h2708], and shewed[^h3045] them my judgments[^h4941], which if a man[^h120] do[^h6213], he shall even live[^h2425] in them. 
###### 12
Moreover also I gave[^h5414] them my sabbaths[^h7676], to be a sign[^h226] between me and them, that they might know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] that sanctify[^h6942] them.
###### 13
But the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] rebelled[^h4784] against me in the wilderness[^h4057]: they walked[^h1980] not in my statutes[^h2708], and they despised[^h3988] my judgments[^h4941], which if a man[^h120] do[^h6213], he shall even live[^h2425] in them; and my sabbaths[^h7676] they greatly[^h3966] polluted[^h2490]: then I said[^h559], I would pour out[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon them in the wilderness[^h4057], to consume[^h3615] them.
###### 14
But I wrought[^h6213] for my name's[^h8034] sake, that it should not be polluted[^h2490] before[^h5869] the heathen[^h1471], in whose sight[^h5869] I brought them out[^h3318].
###### 15
Yet also I lifted up[^h5375] my hand[^h3027] unto them in the wilderness[^h4057], that I would not bring[^h935] them into the land[^h776] which I had given[^h5414] them, flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], which is the glory[^h6643] of all lands[^h776];
###### 16
Because they despised[^h3988] my judgments[^h4941], and walked[^h1980] not in my statutes[^h2708], but polluted[^h2490] my sabbaths[^h7676]: for their heart[^h3820] went[^h1980] after[^h310] their idols[^h1544].
###### 17
Nevertheless mine eye[^h5869] spared[^h2347] them from destroying[^h7843] them, neither did I make[^h6213] an end[^h3617] of them in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 18
But I said[^h559] unto their children[^h1121] in the wilderness[^h4057], Walk[^h3212] ye not in the statutes[^h2706] of your fathers[^h1], neither observe[^h8104] their judgments[^h4941], nor defile[^h2930] yourselves with their idols[^h1544]:
###### 19
I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; walk[^h3212] in my statutes[^h2708], and keep[^h8104] my judgments[^h4941], and do[^h6213] them;
###### 20
And hallow[^h6942] my sabbaths[^h7676]; and they shall be a sign[^h226] between me and you, that ye may know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430].
###### 21
Notwithstanding the children[^h1121] rebelled[^h4784] against me: they walked[^h1980] not in my statutes[^h2708], neither kept[^h8104] my judgments[^h4941] to do[^h6213] them, which if a man[^h120] do[^h6213], he shall even live[^h2425] in them; they polluted[^h2490] my sabbaths[^h7676]: then I said[^h559], I would pour out[^h8210] my fury[^h2534] upon them, to accomplish[^h3615] my anger[^h639] against them in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 22
Nevertheless I withdrew[^h7725] mine hand[^h3027], and wrought[^h6213] for my name's[^h8034] sake, that it should not be polluted[^h2490] in the sight[^h5869] of the heathen[^h1471], in whose sight[^h5869] I brought them forth[^h3318].
###### 23
I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] unto them also in the wilderness[^h4057], that I would scatter[^h6327] them among the heathen[^h1471], and disperse[^h2219] them through the countries[^h776];
###### 24
Because they had not executed[^h6213] my judgments[^h4941], but had despised[^h3988] my statutes[^h2708], and had polluted[^h2490] my sabbaths[^h7676], and their eyes[^h5869] were after[^h310] their fathers'[^h1] idols[^h1544].
###### 25
Wherefore I gave[^h5414] them also statutes[^h2706] that were not good[^h2896], and judgments[^h4941] whereby they should not live[^h2421];
###### 26
And I polluted[^h2930] them in their own gifts[^h4979], in that they caused to pass through[^h5674] the fire all that openeth[^h6363] the womb[^h7356], that I might make them desolate[^h8074], to the end that they might know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 27
Therefore, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], speak[^h1696] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], and say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Yet in this your fathers[^h1] have blasphemed[^h1442] me, in that they have committed[^h4603] a trespass[^h4604] against me. 
###### 28
For when I had brought[^h935] them into the land[^h776], for the which I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] to give[^h5414] it to them, then they saw[^h7200] every high[^h7311] hill[^h1389], and all the thick[^h5687] trees[^h6086], and they offered[^h2076] there their sacrifices[^h2077], and there they presented[^h5414] the provocation[^h3708] of their offering[^h7133]: there also they made[^h7760] their sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381], and poured out[^h5258] there their drink offerings[^h5262].
###### 29
Then I said[^h559] unto them, What is the high place[^h1116] whereunto ye go[^h935]? And the name[^h8034] thereof is called[^h7121] Bamah[^h1117] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 30
Wherefore say[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Are ye polluted[^h2930] after the manner[^h1870] of your fathers[^h1]? and commit ye whoredom[^h2181] after[^h310] their abominations[^h8251]?
###### 31
For when ye offer[^h5375] your gifts[^h4979], when ye make your sons[^h1121] to pass through[^h5674] the fire[^h784], ye pollute[^h2930] yourselves with all your idols[^h1544], even unto this day[^h3117]: and shall I be enquired[^h1875] of by you, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]? As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], I will not be enquired[^h1875] of by you.
###### 32
And that which cometh[^h5927] into your mind[^h7307] shall not be at all, that ye say[^h559], We will be[^h1961] as the heathen[^h1471], as the families[^h4940] of the countries[^h776], to serve[^h8334] wood[^h6086] and stone[^h68].
###### 33
As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], surely with a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and with a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220], and with fury[^h2534] poured out[^h8210], will I rule[^h4427] over you:
###### 34
And I will bring you out[^h3318] from the people[^h5971], and will gather[^h6908] you out of the countries[^h776] wherein ye are scattered[^h6327], with a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and with a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220], and with fury[^h2534] poured out[^h8210].
###### 35
And I will bring[^h935] you into the wilderness[^h4057] of the people[^h5971], and there will I plead[^h8199] with you face[^h6440] to face[^h6440].
###### 36
Like as I pleaded[^h8199] with your fathers[^h1] in the wilderness[^h4057] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], so will I plead[^h8199] with you, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 37
And I will cause you to pass[^h5674] under the rod[^h7626], and I will bring[^h935] you into the bond[^h4562] of the covenant[^h1285]: 
###### 38
And I will purge out[^h1305] from among you the rebels[^h4775], and them that transgress[^h6586] against me: I will bring them forth[^h3318] out of the country[^h776] where they sojourn[^h4033], and they shall not enter[^h935] into the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 39
As for you, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Go[^h3212] ye, serve[^h5647] ye every one[^h376] his idols[^h1544], and hereafter[^h310] also, if ye will not hearken[^h8085] unto me: but pollute[^h2490] ye my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034] no more with your gifts[^h4979], and with your idols[^h1544].
###### 40
For in mine holy[^h6944] mountain[^h2022], in the mountain[^h2022] of the height[^h4791] of Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], there shall all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], all of them in the land[^h776], serve[^h5647] me: there will I accept[^h7521] them, and there will I require[^h1875] your offerings[^h8641], and the firstfruits[^h7225] of your oblations[^h4864], with all your holy things[^h6944]. 
###### 41
I will accept[^h7521] you with your sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381], when I bring you out[^h3318] from the people[^h5971], and gather[^h6908] you out of the countries[^h776] wherein ye have been scattered[^h6327]; and I will be sanctified[^h6942] in you before[^h5869] the heathen[^h1471]. 
###### 42
And ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I shall bring[^h935] you into the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478], into the country[^h776] for the which I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] to give[^h5414] it to your fathers[^h1].
###### 43
And there shall ye remember[^h2142] your ways[^h1870], and all your doings[^h5949], wherein ye have been defiled[^h2930]; and ye shall lothe[^h6962] yourselves in your own sight[^h6440] for all your evils[^h7451] that ye have committed[^h6213].
###### 44
And ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I have wrought[^h6213] with you for my name's[^h8034] sake, not according to your wicked[^h7451] ways[^h1870], nor according to your corrupt[^h7843] doings[^h5949], O ye house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 45
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 46
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], set[^h7760] thy face[^h6440] toward[^h1870] the south[^h8486], and drop[^h5197] thy word toward the south[^h1864], and prophesy[^h5012] against the forest[^h3293] of the south[^h5045] field[^h7704];
###### 47
And say[^h559] to the forest[^h3293] of the south[^h5045], Hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]; Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will kindle[^h3341] a fire[^h784] in thee, and it shall devour[^h398] every green[^h3892] tree[^h6086] in thee, and every dry[^h3002] tree[^h6086]: the flaming[^h3852] flame[^h7957] shall not be quenched[^h3518], and all faces[^h6440] from the south[^h5045] to the north[^h6828] shall be burned[^h6866] therein.
###### 48
And all flesh[^h1320] shall see[^h7200] that I the LORD[^h3068] have kindled[^h1197] it: it shall not be quenched[^h3518].
###### 49
Then said[^h559] I, Ah[^h162] Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]! they say[^h559] of me, Doth he not speak[^h4911] parables[^h4912]?

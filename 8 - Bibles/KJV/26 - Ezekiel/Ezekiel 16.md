###### 1
Again the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], cause Jerusalem[^h3389] to know[^h3045] her abominations[^h8441],
###### 3
And say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] unto Jerusalem[^h3389]; Thy birth[^h4351] and thy nativity[^h4138] is of the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3669]; thy father[^h1] was an Amorite[^h567], and thy mother[^h517] an Hittite[^h2850]. 
###### 4
And as for thy nativity[^h4138], in the day[^h3117] thou wast born[^h3205] thy navel[^h8270] was not cut[^h3772], neither wast thou washed[^h7364] in water[^h4325] to supple[^h4935] thee; thou wast not salted[^h4414] at all[^h4414], nor swaddled[^h2853] at all[^h2853]. 
###### 5
None eye[^h5869] pitied[^h2347] thee, to do[^h6213] any[^h259] of these unto thee, to have compassion[^h2550] upon thee; but thou wast cast out[^h7993] in the open[^h6440] field[^h7704], to the lothing[^h1604] of thy person[^h5315], in the day[^h3117] that thou wast born[^h3205].
###### 6
And when I passed[^h5674] by thee, and saw[^h7200] thee polluted[^h947] in thine own blood[^h1818], I said[^h559] unto thee when thou wast in thy blood[^h1818], Live[^h2421]; yea, I said[^h559] unto thee when thou wast in thy blood[^h1818], Live[^h2421]. 
###### 7
I have caused[^h5414] thee to multiply[^h7233] as the bud[^h6780] of the field[^h7704], and thou hast increased[^h7235] and waxen great[^h1431], and thou art come[^h935] to excellent[^h5716] ornaments[^h5716]: thy breasts[^h7699] are fashioned[^h3559], and thine hair[^h8181] is grown[^h6779], whereas thou wast naked[^h5903] and bare[^h6181].  
###### 8
Now when I passed[^h5674] by thee, and looked[^h7200] upon thee, behold, thy time[^h6256] was the time[^h6256] of love[^h1730]; and I spread[^h6566] my skirt[^h3671] over thee, and covered[^h3680] thy nakedness[^h6172]: yea, I sware[^h7650] unto thee, and entered[^h935] into a covenant[^h1285] with thee, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], and thou becamest mine.
###### 9
Then washed[^h7364] I thee with water[^h4325]; yea, I throughly washed away[^h7857] thy blood[^h1818] from thee, and I anointed[^h5480] thee with oil[^h8081]. 
###### 10
I clothed[^h3847] thee also with broidered work[^h7553], and shod[^h5274] thee with badgers' skin[^h8476], and I girded[^h2280] thee about with fine linen[^h8336], and I covered[^h3680] thee with silk[^h4897].
###### 11
I decked[^h5710] thee also with ornaments[^h5716], and I put[^h5414] bracelets[^h6781] upon thy hands[^h3027], and a chain[^h7242] on thy neck[^h1627].
###### 12
And I put[^h5414] a jewel[^h5141] on thy forehead[^h639], and earrings[^h5694] in thine ears[^h241], and a beautiful[^h8597] crown[^h5850] upon thine head[^h7218]. 
###### 13
Thus wast thou decked[^h5710] with gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701]; and thy raiment[^h4403] was of fine linen[^h8336] [^h8336], and silk[^h4897], and broidered work[^h7553]; thou didst eat[^h398] fine flour[^h5560], and honey[^h1706], and oil[^h8081]: and thou wast exceeding[^h3966] beautiful[^h3302], and thou didst prosper[^h6743] into a kingdom[^h4410].
###### 14
And thy renown[^h8034] went forth[^h3318] among the heathen[^h1471] for thy beauty[^h3308]: for it was perfect[^h3632] through my comeliness[^h1926], which I had put[^h7760] upon thee, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 15
But thou didst trust[^h982] in thine own beauty[^h3308], and playedst the harlot[^h2181] because of thy renown[^h8034], and pouredst out[^h8210] thy fornications[^h8457] on every one that passed by[^h5674]; his it was.
###### 16
And of thy garments[^h899] thou didst take[^h3947], and deckedst[^h6213] thy high places[^h1116] with divers colours[^h2921], and playedst the harlot[^h2181] thereupon: the like things shall not come[^h935], neither shall it be so.
###### 17
Thou hast also taken[^h3947] thy fair[^h8597] jewels[^h3627] of my gold[^h2091] and of my silver[^h3701], which I had given[^h5414] thee, and madest[^h6213] to thyself images[^h6754] of men[^h2145], and didst commit whoredom[^h2181] with them, 
###### 18
And tookest[^h3947] thy broidered[^h7553] garments[^h899], and coveredst[^h3680] them: and thou hast set[^h5414] mine oil[^h8081] and mine incense[^h7004] before[^h6440] them.
###### 19
My meat[^h3899] also which I gave[^h5414] thee, fine flour[^h5560], and oil[^h8081], and honey[^h1706], wherewith I fed[^h398] thee, thou hast even set[^h5414] it before[^h6440] them for a sweet[^h5207] savour[^h7381]: and thus it was, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]. 
###### 20
Moreover thou hast taken[^h3947] thy sons[^h1121] and thy daughters[^h1323], whom thou hast borne[^h3205] unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed[^h2076] unto them to be devoured[^h398]. Is this of thy whoredoms[^h8457] a small matter[^h4592], 
###### 21
That thou hast slain[^h7819] my children[^h1121], and delivered[^h5414] them to cause them to pass through[^h5674] the fire for them?
###### 22
And in all thine abominations[^h8441] and thy whoredoms[^h8457] thou hast not remembered[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of thy youth[^h5271], when thou wast naked[^h5903] and bare[^h6181], and wast polluted[^h947] in thy blood[^h1818].
###### 23
And it came to pass after[^h310] all thy wickedness[^h7451], (woe[^h188], woe[^h188] unto thee! saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069];)
###### 24
That thou hast also built[^h1129] unto thee an eminent place[^h1354], and hast made[^h6213] thee an high place[^h7413] in every street[^h7339]. 
###### 25
Thou hast built[^h1129] thy high place[^h7413] at every head[^h7218] of the way[^h1870], and hast made thy beauty[^h3308] to be abhorred[^h8581], and hast opened[^h6589] thy feet[^h7272] to every one that passed by[^h5674], and multiplied[^h7235] thy whoredoms[^h8457].
###### 26
Thou hast also committed fornication[^h2181] with the Egyptians[^h1121] [^h4714] thy neighbours[^h7934], great[^h1432] of flesh[^h1320]; and hast increased[^h7235] thy whoredoms[^h8457], to provoke me to anger[^h3707].
###### 27
Behold, therefore I have stretched out[^h5186] my hand[^h3027] over thee, and have diminished[^h1639] thine ordinary[^h2706] food, and delivered[^h5414] thee unto the will[^h5315] of them that hate[^h8130] thee, the daughters[^h1323] of the Philistines[^h6430], which are ashamed[^h3637] of thy lewd[^h2154] way[^h1870]. 
###### 28
Thou hast played the whore[^h2181] also with the Assyrians[^h1121] [^h804], because[^h1115] thou wast unsatiable[^h7646]; yea, thou hast played the harlot[^h2181] with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied[^h7654].
###### 29
Thou hast moreover multiplied[^h7235] thy fornication[^h8457] in the land[^h776] of Canaan[^h3667] unto Chaldea[^h3778]; and yet thou wast not satisfied[^h7646] herewith[^h2063].
###### 30
How weak[^h535] is thine heart[^h3826], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], seeing thou doest[^h6213] all these things, the work[^h4639] of an imperious[^h7986] whorish[^h2181] woman[^h802];
###### 31
In that thou buildest[^h1129] thine eminent place[^h1354] in the head[^h7218] of every way[^h1870], and makest[^h6213] thine high place[^h7413] in every street[^h7339]; and hast not been as an harlot[^h2181], in that thou scornest[^h7046] hire[^h868]; 
###### 32
But as a wife[^h802] that committeth adultery[^h5003], which taketh[^h3947] strangers[^h2114] instead of her husband[^h376]!
###### 33
They give[^h5414] gifts[^h5078] to all whores[^h2181]: but thou givest[^h5414] thy gifts[^h5083] to all thy lovers[^h157], and hirest[^h7809] them, that they may come[^h935] unto thee on every side[^h5439] for thy whoredom[^h8457]. 
###### 34
And the contrary[^h2016] is in thee from other women[^h802] in thy whoredoms[^h8457], whereas none followeth[^h310] thee to commit whoredoms[^h2181]: and in that thou givest[^h5414] a reward[^h868], and no reward[^h868] is given[^h5414] unto thee, therefore thou art[^h1961] contrary[^h2016].
###### 35
Wherefore, O harlot[^h2181], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 36
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because thy filthiness[^h5178] was poured out[^h8210], and thy nakedness[^h6172] discovered[^h1540] through thy whoredoms[^h8457] with thy lovers[^h157], and with all the idols[^h1544] of thy abominations[^h8441], and by the blood[^h1818] of thy children[^h1121], which thou didst give[^h5414] unto them;
###### 37
Behold, therefore I will gather[^h6908] all thy lovers[^h157], with whom thou hast taken pleasure[^h6149], and all them that thou hast loved[^h157], with all them that thou hast hated[^h8130]; I will even gather[^h6908] them round about[^h5439] against thee, and will discover[^h1540] thy nakedness[^h6172] unto them, that they may see[^h7200] all thy nakedness[^h6172].
###### 38
And I will judge[^h8199] thee, as women that break wedlock[^h5003] and shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818] are judged[^h4941]; and I will give[^h5414] thee blood[^h1818] in fury[^h2534] and jealousy[^h7068]. 
###### 39
And I will also give[^h5414] thee into their hand[^h3027], and they shall throw down[^h2040] thine eminent place[^h1354], and shall break down[^h5422] thy high places[^h7413]: they shall strip[^h6584] thee also of thy clothes[^h899], and shall take[^h3947] thy fair[^h8597] jewels[^h3627], and leave[^h3240] thee naked[^h5903] and bare[^h6181]. 
###### 40
They shall also bring up[^h5927] a company[^h6951] against thee, and they shall stone[^h7275] thee with stones[^h68], and thrust thee through[^h1333] with their swords[^h2719].
###### 41
And they shall burn[^h8313] thine houses[^h1004] with fire[^h784], and execute[^h6213] judgments[^h8201] upon thee in the sight[^h5869] of many[^h7227] women[^h802]: and I will cause thee to cease[^h7673] from playing the harlot[^h2181], and thou also shalt give[^h5414] no hire[^h868] any more.
###### 42
So will I make my fury[^h2534] toward thee to rest[^h5117], and my jealousy[^h7068] shall depart[^h5493] from thee, and I will be quiet[^h8252], and will be no more angry[^h3707].
###### 43
Because thou hast not remembered[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of thy youth[^h5271], but hast fretted[^h7264] me in all these things; behold[^h1887], therefore I also will recompense[^h5414] thy way[^h1870] upon thine head[^h7218], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]: and thou shalt not commit[^h6213] this lewdness[^h2154] above all thine abominations[^h8441].
###### 44
Behold, every one that useth proverbs[^h4911] shall use this proverb[^h4911] against thee, saying[^h559], As is the mother[^h517], so is her daughter[^h1323].
###### 45
Thou art thy mother's[^h517] daughter[^h1323], that lotheth[^h1602] her husband[^h376] and her children[^h1121]; and thou art the sister[^h269] of thy sisters[^h269], which lothed[^h1602] their husbands[^h582] and their children[^h1121]: your mother[^h517] was an Hittite[^h2850], and your father[^h1] an Amorite[^h567].
###### 46
And thine elder[^h1419] sister[^h269] is Samaria[^h8111], she and her daughters[^h1323] that dwell[^h3427] at thy left hand[^h8040]: and thy younger[^h6996] sister[^h269], that dwelleth[^h3427] at thy right hand[^h3225], is Sodom[^h5467] and her daughters[^h1323]. 
###### 47
Yet hast thou not walked[^h1980] after their ways[^h1870], nor done[^h6213] after their abominations[^h8441]: but, as if that were a very[^h6985] little[^h4592] [^h6962] thing, thou wast corrupted[^h7843] more than they[^h2004] in all thy ways[^h1870]. 
###### 48
As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], Sodom[^h5467] thy sister[^h269] hath not done[^h6213], she nor her daughters[^h1323], as thou hast done[^h6213], thou and thy daughters[^h1323].
###### 49
Behold, this was the iniquity[^h5771] of thy sister[^h269] Sodom[^h5467], pride[^h1347], fulness[^h7653] of bread[^h3899], and abundance[^h7962] of idleness[^h8252] was in her and in her daughters[^h1323], neither did she strengthen[^h2388] the hand[^h3027] of the poor[^h6041] and needy[^h34].
###### 50
And they were haughty[^h1361], and committed[^h6213] abomination[^h8441] before[^h6440] me: therefore I took them away[^h5493] as I saw[^h7200] good.
###### 51
Neither hath Samaria[^h8111] committed[^h2398] half[^h2677] of thy sins[^h2403]; but thou hast multiplied[^h7235] thine abominations[^h8441] more than they[^h2007], and hast justified[^h6663] thy sisters[^h269] in all thine abominations[^h8441] which thou hast done[^h6213].
###### 52
Thou also, which hast judged[^h6419] thy sisters[^h269], bear[^h5375] thine own shame[^h3639] for thy sins[^h2403] that thou hast committed more abominable[^h8581] than they[^h2004]: they are more righteous[^h6663] than thou: yea, be thou confounded[^h954] also, and bear[^h5375] thy shame[^h3639], in that thou hast justified[^h6663] thy sisters[^h269].
###### 53
When I shall bring again[^h7725] their captivity[^h7622] [^h7622], the captivity[^h7622] [^h7622] of Sodom[^h5467] and her daughters[^h1323], and the captivity[^h7622] [^h7622] of Samaria[^h8111] and her daughters[^h1323], then will I bring again the captivity[^h7622] [^h7622] of thy captives[^h7622] in the midst[^h8432] of them:
###### 54
That thou mayest bear[^h5375] thine own shame[^h3639], and mayest be confounded[^h3637] in all that thou hast done[^h6213], in that thou art a comfort[^h5162] unto them.
###### 55
When thy sisters[^h269], Sodom[^h5467] and her daughters[^h1323], shall return[^h7725] to their former estate[^h6927], and Samaria[^h8111] and her daughters[^h1323] shall return[^h7725] to their former estate[^h6927], then thou and thy daughters[^h1323] shall return[^h7725] to your former estate[^h6927].
###### 56
For thy sister[^h269] Sodom[^h5467] was not mentioned[^h8052] by thy mouth[^h6310] in the day[^h3117] of thy pride[^h1347],  
###### 57
Before thy wickedness[^h7451] was discovered[^h1540], as at the time[^h6256] of thy reproach[^h2781] of the daughters[^h1323] of Syria[^h758], and all that are round about[^h5439] her, the daughters[^h1323] of the Philistines[^h6430], which despise[^h7590] thee round about[^h5439].  
###### 58
Thou hast borne[^h5375] thy lewdness[^h2154] and thine abominations[^h8441], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 59
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will even deal[^h6213] with thee as thou hast done[^h6213], which hast despised[^h959] the oath[^h423] in breaking[^h6565] the covenant[^h1285].
###### 60
Nevertheless I will remember[^h2142] my covenant[^h1285] with thee in the days[^h3117] of thy youth[^h5271], and I will establish[^h6965] unto thee an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285].
###### 61
Then thou shalt remember[^h2142] thy ways[^h1870], and be ashamed[^h3637], when thou shalt receive[^h3947] thy sisters[^h269], thine elder[^h1419] and thy younger[^h6996]: and I will give[^h5414] them unto thee for daughters[^h1323], but not by thy covenant[^h1285].
###### 62
And I will establish[^h6965] my covenant[^h1285] with thee; and thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 63
That thou mayest remember[^h2142], and be confounded[^h954], and never open[^h6610] thy mouth[^h6310] any more because[^h6440] of thy shame[^h3639], when I am pacified[^h3722] toward thee for all that thou hast done[^h6213], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

###### 1
Moreover take thou up[^h5375] a lamentation[^h7015] for the princes[^h5387] of Israel[^h3478],
###### 2
And say[^h559], What is thy mother[^h517]? A lioness[^h3833]: she lay down[^h7257] among lions[^h738], she nourished[^h7235] her whelps[^h1482] among[^h8432] young lions[^h3715].
###### 3
And she brought up[^h5927] one[^h259] of her whelps[^h1482]: it became a young lion[^h3715], and it learned[^h3925] to catch[^h2963] the prey[^h2964]; it devoured[^h398] men[^h120].
###### 4
The nations[^h1471] also heard[^h8085] of him; he was taken[^h8610] in their pit[^h7845], and they brought[^h935] him with chains[^h2397] unto the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 5
Now when she saw[^h7200] that she had waited[^h3176], and her hope[^h8615] was lost[^h6], then she took[^h3947] another[^h259] of her whelps[^h1482], and made[^h7760] him a young lion[^h3715].
###### 6
And he went up and down[^h1980] among[^h8432] the lions[^h738], he became a young lion[^h3715], and learned[^h3925] to catch[^h2963] the prey[^h2964], and devoured[^h398] men[^h120].
###### 7
And he knew[^h3045] their desolate palaces[^h490], and he laid waste[^h2717] their cities[^h5892]; and the land[^h776] was desolate[^h3456], and the fulness[^h4393] thereof, by the noise[^h6963] of his roaring[^h7581].  
###### 8
Then the nations[^h1471] set[^h5414] against him on every side[^h5439] from the provinces[^h4082], and spread[^h6566] their net[^h7568] over him: he was taken[^h8610] in their pit[^h7845].
###### 9
And they put[^h5414] him in ward[^h5474] in chains[^h2397], and brought[^h935] him to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]: they brought[^h935] him into holds[^h4685], that his voice[^h6963] should no more be heard[^h8085] upon the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 10
Thy mother[^h517] is like a vine[^h1612] in thy blood[^h1818] [^h1818], planted[^h8362] by the waters[^h4325]: she was fruitful[^h6509] and full of branches[^h6058] by reason of many[^h7227] waters[^h4325]. 
###### 11
And she had strong[^h5797] rods[^h4294] for the sceptres[^h7626] of them that bare rule[^h4910], and her stature[^h6967] was exalted[^h1361] among the thick branches[^h5688], and she appeared[^h7200] in her height[^h1363] with the multitude[^h7230] of her branches[^h1808].
###### 12
But she was plucked up[^h5428] in fury[^h2534], she was cast down[^h7993] to the ground[^h776], and the east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] dried up[^h3001] her fruit[^h6529]: her strong[^h5797] rods[^h4294] were broken[^h6561] and withered[^h3001]; the fire[^h784] consumed[^h398] them.
###### 13
And now she is planted[^h8362] in the wilderness[^h4057], in a dry[^h6723] and thirsty[^h6772] ground[^h776].
###### 14
And fire[^h784] is gone out[^h3318] of a rod[^h4294] of her branches[^h905], which hath devoured[^h398] her fruit[^h6529], so that she hath no strong[^h5797] rod[^h4294] to be a sceptre[^h7626] to rule[^h4910]. This is a lamentation[^h7015], and shall be for a lamentation[^h7015].

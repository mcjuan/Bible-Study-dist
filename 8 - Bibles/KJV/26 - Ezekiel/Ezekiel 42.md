###### 1
Then he brought me forth[^h3318] into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], the way toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828]: and he brought[^h935] me into the chamber[^h3957] that was over against the separate place[^h1508], and which was before the building[^h1146] toward the north[^h6828].
###### 2
Before[^h6440] the length[^h753] of an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520] was the north[^h6828] door[^h6607], and the breadth[^h7341] was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520].
###### 3
Over against the twenty[^h6242] cubits which were for the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691], and over against the pavement[^h7531] which was for the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], was gallery[^h862] against[^h6440] gallery[^h862] in three[^h7992] stories.
###### 4
And before[^h6440] the chambers[^h3957] was a walk[^h4109] of ten[^h6235] cubits[^h520] breadth[^h7341] inward[^h6442], a way[^h1870] of one[^h259] cubit[^h520]; and their doors[^h6607] toward the north[^h6828].
###### 5
Now the upper[^h5945] chambers[^h3957] were shorter[^h7114]: for the galleries[^h862] were higher[^h398] than these[^h2007], than the lower[^h8481], and than the middlemost[^h8484] of the building[^h1146].  
###### 6
For they were in three[^h8027] stories, but had not pillars[^h5982] as the pillars[^h5982] of the courts[^h2691]: therefore the building was straitened[^h680] more than the lowest[^h8481] and the middlemost[^h8484] from the ground[^h776].
###### 7
And the wall[^h1447] that was without[^h2351] over against[^h5980] the chambers[^h3957], toward[^h1870] the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691] on the forepart[^h6440] of the chambers[^h3957], the length[^h753] thereof was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520].
###### 8
For the length[^h753] of the chambers[^h3957] that were in the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691] was fifty[^h2572] cubits[^h520]: and, lo, before[^h6440] the temple[^h1964] were an hundred[^h3967] cubits[^h520].
###### 9
And from under these chambers[^h3957] was the entry[^h3996] [^h935] on the east side[^h6921], as one goeth[^h935] into them[^h2007] from the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691].   
###### 10
The chambers[^h3957] were in the thickness[^h7341] of the wall[^h1444] of the court[^h2691] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921], over against[^h6440] the separate place[^h1508], and over against[^h6440] the building[^h1146].
###### 11
And the way[^h1870] before[^h6440] them was like the appearance[^h4758] of the chambers[^h3957] which were toward[^h1870] the north[^h6828], as long as[^h753] they, and as broad as[^h3651] [^h7341] they: and all their goings out[^h4161] were both according to their fashions[^h4941], and according to their doors[^h6607].
###### 12
And according to the doors[^h6607] of the chambers[^h3957] that were toward[^h1870] the south[^h1864] was a door[^h6607] in the head[^h7218] of the way[^h1870], even the way[^h1870] directly[^h1903] before[^h6440] the wall[^h1448] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921], as one entereth[^h935] into them.
###### 13
Then said[^h559] he unto me, The north[^h6828] chambers[^h3957] and the south[^h1864] chambers[^h3957], which are before[^h6440] the separate place[^h1508], they be holy[^h6944] chambers[^h3957], where the priests[^h3548] that approach[^h7138] unto the LORD[^h3068] shall eat[^h398] the most[^h6944] holy things[^h6944]: there shall they lay[^h3240] the most[^h6944] holy things[^h6944], and the meat offering[^h4503], and the sin offering[^h2403], and the trespass offering[^h817]; for the place[^h4725] is holy[^h6918].
###### 14
When the priests[^h3548] enter[^h935] therein, then shall they not go out[^h3318] of the holy[^h6944] place into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], but there they shall lay[^h3240] their garments[^h899] wherein they minister[^h8334]; for they are holy[^h6944]; and shall put[^h3847] [^h3847] on other[^h312] garments[^h899], and shall approach[^h7126] to those things which are for the people[^h5971].
###### 15
Now when he had made an end[^h3615] of measuring[^h4060] the inner[^h6442] house[^h1004], he brought me forth[^h3318] toward[^h1870] the gate[^h8179] whose prospect[^h6440] is toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921], and measured[^h4058] it round about[^h5439].
###### 16
He measured[^h4058] the east[^h6921] side[^h7307] with the measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070], five[^h2568] [^h520] hundred[^h3967] reeds[^h7070], with the measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070] round about[^h5439]. 
###### 17
He measured[^h4058] the north[^h6828] side[^h7307], five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] reeds[^h7070], with the measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070] round about[^h5439].
###### 18
He measured[^h4058] the south[^h1864] side[^h7307], five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] reeds[^h7070], with the measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070].
###### 19
He turned about[^h5437] to the west[^h3220] side[^h7307], and measured[^h4058] five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] reeds[^h7070] with the measuring[^h4060] reed[^h7070].
###### 20
He measured[^h4058] it by the four[^h702] sides[^h7307]: it had a wall[^h2346] round about[^h5439], five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] reeds long[^h753], and five[^h2568] hundred[^h3967] broad[^h7341], to make a separation[^h914] between the sanctuary[^h6944] and the profane place[^h2455].

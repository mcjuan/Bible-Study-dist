###### 1
Then I looked[^h7200], and, behold, in the firmament[^h7549] that was above the head[^h7218] of the cherubims[^h3742] there appeared[^h7200] over them as it were a sapphire[^h5601] stone[^h68], as the appearance[^h4758] of the likeness[^h1823] of a throne[^h3678].
###### 2
And he spake[^h559] unto the man[^h376] clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906], and said[^h559], Go in[^h935] between[^h996] the wheels[^h1534], even under the cherub[^h3742], and fill[^h4390] thine hand[^h2651] with coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784] from between[^h996] the cherubims[^h3742], and scatter[^h2236] them over the city[^h5892]. And he went in[^h935] in my sight[^h5869]. 
###### 3
Now the cherubims[^h3742] stood[^h5975] on the right side[^h3225] of the house[^h1004], when the man[^h376] went in[^h935]; and the cloud[^h6051] filled[^h4390] the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691].
###### 4
Then the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] went up[^h7311] from the cherub[^h3742], and stood over the threshold[^h4670] of the house[^h1004]; and the house[^h1004] was filled[^h4390] with the cloud[^h6051], and the court[^h2691] was full[^h4390] of the brightness[^h5051] of the LORD'S[^h3068] glory[^h3519]. 
###### 5
And the sound[^h6963] of the cherubims'[^h3742] wings[^h3671] was heard[^h8085] even to the outer[^h2435] court[^h2691], as the voice[^h6963] of the Almighty[^h7706] God[^h410] when he speaketh[^h1696].
###### 6
And it came to pass, that when he had commanded[^h6680] the man[^h376] clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906], saying[^h559], Take[^h3947] fire[^h784] from between the wheels[^h1534], from between the cherubims[^h3742]; then he went in[^h935], and stood[^h5975] beside[^h681] the wheels[^h212].
###### 7
And one cherub[^h3742] stretched forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] from between the cherubims[^h3742] unto the fire[^h784] that was between the cherubims[^h3742], and took[^h5375] thereof, and put[^h5414] it into the hands[^h2651] of him that was clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906]: who took[^h3947] it, and went out[^h3318]. 
###### 8
And there appeared[^h7200] in the cherubims[^h3742] the form[^h8403] of a man's[^h120] hand[^h3027] under their wings[^h3671].
###### 9
And when I looked[^h7200], behold the four[^h702] wheels[^h212] by[^h681] the cherubims[^h3742], one[^h259] wheel[^h212] by[^h681] one[^h259] cherub[^h3742], and another[^h259] wheel[^h212] by[^h681] another[^h259] cherub[^h3742]: and the appearance[^h4758] of the wheels[^h212] was as the colour[^h5869] of a beryl[^h8658] stone[^h68].
###### 10
And as for their appearances[^h4758], they four[^h702] had one[^h259] likeness[^h1823], as if a wheel[^h212] had been in the midst[^h8432] of a wheel[^h212].
###### 11
When they went[^h3212], they went[^h3212] upon their four[^h702] sides[^h7253]; they turned[^h5437] not as they went[^h3212], but to the place[^h4725] whither the head[^h7218] looked[^h6437] they followed[^h3212] [^h310] it; they turned[^h5437] not as they went[^h3212].
###### 12
And their whole body[^h1320], and their backs[^h1354], and their hands[^h3027], and their wings[^h3671], and the wheels[^h212], were full[^h4392] of eyes[^h5869] round about[^h5439], even the wheels[^h212] that they four[^h702] had. 
###### 13
As for the wheels[^h212], it was cried[^h7121] unto them in my hearing[^h241], O wheel[^h1534]. 
###### 14
And every one[^h259] had four[^h702] faces[^h6440]: the first[^h259] face[^h6440] was the face[^h6440] of a cherub[^h3742], and the second[^h8145] face[^h6440] was the face[^h6440] of a man[^h120], and the third[^h7992] the face[^h6440] of a lion[^h738], and the fourth[^h7243] the face[^h6440] of an eagle[^h5404].
###### 15
And the cherubims[^h3742] were lifted up[^h7426]. This is the living creature[^h2416] that I saw[^h7200] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529].
###### 16
And when the cherubims[^h3742] went[^h3212], the wheels[^h212] went[^h3212] by them[^h681]: and when the cherubims[^h3742] lifted up[^h5375] their wings[^h3671] to mount up[^h7311] from the earth[^h776], the same wheels[^h212] also[^h1992] turned[^h5437] not from beside[^h681] them.
###### 17
When they stood[^h5975], these stood[^h5975]; and when they were lifted up[^h7311], these lifted up[^h7426] themselves also: for the spirit[^h7307] of the living creature[^h2416] was in them. 
###### 18
Then the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] departed[^h3318] from off the threshold[^h4670] of the house[^h1004], and stood[^h5975] over the cherubims[^h3742].
###### 19
And the cherubims[^h3742] lifted up[^h5375] their wings[^h3671], and mounted up[^h7426] from the earth[^h776] in my sight[^h5869]: when they went out[^h3318], the wheels[^h212] also were beside[^h5980] them, and every one stood[^h5975] at the door[^h6607] of the east[^h6931] gate[^h8179] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004]; and the glory[^h3519] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] was over them above[^h4605].
###### 20
This is the living creature[^h2416] that I saw[^h7200] under the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529]; and I knew[^h3045] that they were the cherubims[^h3742].
###### 21
Every one[^h259] had four[^h702] faces[^h6440] apiece[^h259], and every one[^h259] four[^h702] wings[^h3671]; and the likeness[^h1823] of the hands[^h3027] of a man[^h120] was under their wings[^h3671].
###### 22
And the likeness[^h1823] of their faces[^h6440] was the same[^h1992] faces[^h6440] which I saw[^h7200] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529], their appearances[^h4758] and themselves: they went[^h3212] every one[^h376] straight[^h5676] forward[^h6440].

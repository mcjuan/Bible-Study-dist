###### 1
Afterward he brought me again[^h7725] unto the door[^h6607] of the house[^h1004]; and, behold, waters[^h4325] issued out[^h3318] from under the threshold[^h4670] of the house[^h1004] eastward[^h6921]: for the forefront[^h6440] of the house[^h1004] stood toward the east[^h6921], and the waters[^h4325] came down[^h3381] from under from the right[^h3233] side[^h3802] of the house[^h1004], at the south[^h5045] side of the altar[^h4196].
###### 2
Then brought he me out[^h3318] of the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] northward[^h6828], and led me about[^h5437] the way[^h1870] without unto the utter[^h2351] gate[^h8179] by the way[^h1870] that looketh[^h6437] eastward[^h6921]; and, behold, there ran out[^h6379] waters[^h4325] on the right[^h3233] side[^h3802].
###### 3
And when the man[^h376] that had the line[^h6957] in his hand[^h3027] went forth[^h3318] eastward[^h6921], he measured[^h4058] a thousand[^h505] cubits[^h520], and he brought me through[^h5674] the waters[^h4325]; the waters[^h4325] were to the ankles[^h657]. 
###### 4
Again he measured[^h4058] a thousand[^h505], and brought me through[^h5674] the waters[^h4325]; the waters[^h4325] were to the knees[^h1290]. Again he measured[^h4058] a thousand[^h505], and brought me through[^h5674]; the waters[^h4325] were to the loins[^h4975].
###### 5
Afterward he measured[^h4058] a thousand[^h505]; and it was a river[^h5158] that I could[^h3201] not pass over[^h5674]: for the waters[^h4325] were risen[^h1342], waters[^h4325] to swim in[^h7813], a river[^h5158] that could not be passed over[^h5674]. 
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], hast thou seen[^h7200] this? Then he brought[^h3212] me, and caused me to return[^h7725] to the brink[^h8193] of the river[^h5158].
###### 7
Now when I had returned[^h7725], behold, at the bank[^h8193] of the river[^h5158] were very[^h3966] many[^h7227] trees[^h6086] on the one side and on the other. 
###### 8
Then said[^h559] he unto me, These waters[^h4325] issue out[^h3318] toward the east[^h6930] country[^h1552], and go down[^h3381] into the desert[^h6160], and go[^h935] into the sea[^h3220]: which being brought forth[^h3318] into the sea[^h3220], the waters[^h4325] shall be healed[^h7495]. 
###### 9
And it shall come to pass, that every thing[^h5315] that liveth[^h2416], which moveth[^h8317], whithersoever the rivers[^h5158] shall come[^h935], shall live[^h2421]: and there shall be a very[^h3966] great[^h7227] multitude of fish[^h1710], because these waters[^h4325] shall come[^h935] thither: for they shall be healed[^h7495]; and every thing shall live[^h2425] whither the river[^h5158] cometh[^h935]. 
###### 10
And it shall come to pass, that the fishers[^h1728] shall stand[^h5975] [^h5975] upon it from Engedi[^h5872] even unto Eneglaim[^h5882]; they shall be a place to spread forth[^h4894] nets[^h2764]; their fish[^h1710] shall be according to their kinds[^h4327], as the fish[^h1710] of the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220], exceeding[^h3966] many[^h7227].
###### 11
But the miry places[^h1207] thereof and the marishes[^h1360] thereof shall not be healed[^h7495]; they shall be given[^h5414] to salt[^h4417]. 
###### 12
And by the river[^h5158] upon the bank[^h8193] thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow[^h5927] all trees[^h6086] for meat[^h3978], whose leaf[^h5929] shall not fade[^h5034], neither shall the fruit[^h6529] thereof be consumed[^h8552]: it shall bring forth new fruit[^h1069] according to his months[^h2320], because their waters[^h4325] they issued out[^h3318] of the sanctuary[^h4720]: and the fruit[^h6529] thereof shall be for meat[^h3978], and the leaf[^h5929] thereof for medicine[^h8644].   
###### 13
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; This[^h1454] shall be the border[^h1366], whereby ye shall inherit[^h5157] the land[^h776] according to the twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478]: Joseph[^h3130] shall have two portions[^h2256].
###### 14
And ye shall inherit[^h5157] it, one[^h376] as well as another[^h251]: concerning the which I lifted up[^h5375] mine hand[^h3027] to give[^h5414] it unto your fathers[^h1]: and this land[^h776] shall fall[^h5307] unto you for inheritance[^h5159]. 
###### 15
And this shall be the border[^h1366] of the land[^h776] toward the north[^h6828] side[^h6285], from the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220], the way[^h1870] of Hethlon[^h2855], as men go[^h935] to Zedad[^h6657];
###### 16
Hamath[^h2574], Berothah[^h1268], Sibraim[^h5453], which is between the border[^h1366] of Damascus[^h1834] and the border[^h1366] of Hamath[^h2574]; Hazarhatticon[^h2694], which is by the coast[^h1366] of Hauran[^h2362]. 
###### 17
And the border[^h1366] from the sea[^h3220] shall be Hazarenan[^h2703], the border[^h1366] of Damascus[^h1834], and the north[^h6828] northward[^h6828], and the border[^h1366] of Hamath[^h2574]. And this is the north[^h6828] side[^h6285].
###### 18
And the east[^h6921] side[^h6285] ye shall measure[^h4058] from[^h996] Hauran[^h2362], and from[^h996] Damascus[^h1834], and from[^h996] Gilead[^h1568], and from[^h996] the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478] by Jordan[^h3383], from the border[^h1366] unto the east[^h6931] sea[^h3220]. And this is the east[^h6921] side[^h6285]. 
###### 19
And the south[^h5045] side[^h6285] southward[^h8486], from Tamar[^h8559] even to the waters[^h4325] of strife[^h4808] [^h4809] in Kadesh[^h6946], the river[^h5158] to the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220]. And this is the south[^h8486] side[^h6285] southward[^h5045].   
###### 20
The west[^h3220] side[^h6285] also shall be the great[^h1419] sea[^h3220] from the border[^h1366], till a man come[^h935] over against[^h5227] Hamath[^h2574]. This is the west[^h3220] side[^h6285].
###### 21
So shall ye divide[^h2505] this land[^h776] unto you according to the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 22
And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide[^h5307] it by lot for an inheritance[^h5159] unto you, and to the strangers[^h1616] that sojourn[^h1481] among[^h8432] you, which shall beget[^h3205] children[^h1121] among[^h8432] you: and they shall be unto you as born[^h249] in the country[^h249] among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]; they shall have[^h5307] inheritance[^h5159] with you among[^h8432] the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 23
And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe[^h7626] the stranger[^h1616] sojourneth[^h1481], there shall ye give[^h5414] him his inheritance[^h5159], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

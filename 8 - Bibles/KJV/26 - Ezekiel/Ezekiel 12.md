###### 1
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] also came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], thou dwellest[^h3427] in the midst[^h8432] of a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004], which have eyes[^h5869] to see[^h7200], and see[^h7200] not; they have ears[^h241] to hear[^h8085], and hear[^h8085] not: for they are a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004].
###### 3
Therefore, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], prepare[^h6213] thee stuff[^h3627] for removing[^h1473], and remove[^h1540] by day[^h3119] in their sight[^h5869]; and thou shalt remove[^h1540] from thy place[^h4725] to another[^h312] place[^h4725] in their sight[^h5869]: it may be they will consider[^h7200], though they be a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004]. 
###### 4
Then shalt thou bring forth[^h3318] thy stuff[^h3627] by day[^h3119] in their sight[^h5869], as stuff[^h3627] for removing[^h1473]: and thou shalt go forth[^h3318] at even[^h6153] in their sight[^h5869], as they that go forth[^h4161] into captivity[^h1473]. 
###### 5
Dig[^h2864] thou through the wall[^h7023] in their sight[^h5869], and carry out[^h3318] thereby. 
###### 6
In their sight[^h5869] shalt thou bear[^h5375] it upon thy shoulders[^h3802], and carry it forth[^h3318] in the twilight[^h5939]: thou shalt cover[^h3680] thy face[^h6440], that thou see[^h7200] not the ground[^h776]: for I have set[^h5414] thee for a sign[^h4159] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
And I did[^h6213] so as I was commanded[^h6680]: I brought forth[^h3318] my stuff[^h3627] by day[^h3119], as stuff[^h3627] for captivity[^h1473], and in the even[^h6153] I digged[^h2864] through the wall[^h7023] with mine hand[^h3027]; I brought it forth[^h3318] in the twilight[^h5939], and I bare[^h5375] it upon my shoulder[^h3802] in their sight[^h5869]. 
###### 8
And in the morning[^h1242] came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 9
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], hath not the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], the rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004], said[^h559] unto thee, What doest[^h6213] thou?
###### 10
Say[^h559] thou unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; This burden[^h4853] concerneth the prince[^h5387] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] that are among[^h8432] them.
###### 11
Say[^h559], I am your sign[^h4159]: like as I have done[^h6213], so shall it be done[^h6213] unto them: they shall remove[^h1473] and go[^h3212] into captivity[^h7628]. 
###### 12
And the prince[^h5387] that is among[^h8432] them shall bear[^h5375] upon his shoulder[^h3802] in the twilight[^h5939], and shall go forth[^h3318]: they shall dig[^h2864] through the wall[^h7023] to carry out[^h3318] thereby: he shall cover[^h3680] his face[^h6440], that[^h3282] he see[^h7200] not the ground[^h776] with his eyes[^h5869].
###### 13
My net[^h7568] also will I spread[^h6566] upon him, and he shall be taken[^h8610] in my snare[^h4686]: and I will bring[^h935] him to Babylon[^h894] to the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]; yet shall he not see[^h7200] it, though he shall die[^h4191] there.
###### 14
And I will scatter[^h2219] toward every wind[^h7307] all that are about[^h5439] him to help[^h5828] him, and all his bands[^h102]; and I will draw out[^h7324] the sword[^h2719] after[^h310] them.
###### 15
And they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I shall scatter[^h6327] them among the nations[^h1471], and disperse[^h2219] them in the countries[^h776].
###### 16
But I will leave[^h3498] a few[^h4557] men[^h582] of them from the sword[^h2719], from the famine[^h7458], and from the pestilence[^h1698]; that they may declare[^h5608] all their abominations[^h8441] among the heathen[^h1471] whither they come[^h935]; and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 17
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to me, saying[^h559],
###### 18
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], eat[^h398] thy bread[^h3899] with quaking[^h7494], and drink[^h8354] thy water[^h4325] with trembling[^h7269] and with carefulness[^h1674];
###### 19
And say[^h559] unto the people[^h5971] of the land[^h127], Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and of the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478]; They shall eat[^h398] their bread[^h3899] with carefulness[^h1674], and drink[^h8354] their water[^h4325] with astonishment[^h8078], that her land[^h776] may be desolate[^h3456] from all that is therein[^h4393], because of the violence[^h2555] of all them that dwell[^h3427] therein. 
###### 20
And the cities[^h5892] that are inhabited[^h3427] shall be laid waste[^h2717], and the land[^h776] shall be desolate[^h8077]; and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 21
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 22
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], what is that proverb[^h4912] that ye have in the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], The days[^h3117] are prolonged[^h748], and every vision[^h2377] faileth[^h6]?
###### 23
Tell[^h559] them therefore, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will make this proverb[^h4912] to cease[^h7673], and they shall no more use it as a proverb[^h4911] in Israel[^h3478]; but say[^h1696] unto them, The days[^h3117] are at hand[^h7126], and the effect[^h1697] of every vision[^h2377].
###### 24
For there shall be no more any vain[^h7723] vision[^h2377] nor flattering[^h2509] divination[^h4738] within[^h8432] the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 25
For I am the LORD[^h3068]: I will speak[^h1696], and the word[^h1697] that I shall speak[^h1696] shall come to pass[^h6213]; it shall be no more prolonged[^h4900]: for in your days[^h3117], O rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004], will I say[^h1696] the word[^h1697], and will perform[^h6213] it, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 26
Again the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to me, saying[^h559],
###### 27
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], behold, they of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] say[^h559], The vision[^h2377] that he seeth[^h2372] is for many[^h7227] days[^h3117] to come, and he prophesieth[^h5012] of the times[^h6256] that are far[^h7350] off.
###### 28
Therefore say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; There shall none of my words[^h1697] be prolonged[^h4900] any more, but the word[^h1697] which I have spoken[^h1696] shall be done[^h6213], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

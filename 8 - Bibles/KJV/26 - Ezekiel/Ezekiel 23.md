###### 1
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came again unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], there were two[^h8147] women[^h802], the daughters[^h1323] of one[^h259] mother[^h517]:
###### 3
And they committed whoredoms[^h2181] in Egypt[^h4714]; they committed whoredoms[^h2181] in their youth[^h5271]: there were their breasts[^h7699] pressed[^h4600], and there they bruised[^h6213] the teats[^h1717] of their virginity[^h1331].
###### 4
And the names[^h8034] of them were Aholah[^h170] the elder[^h1419], and Aholibah[^h172] her sister[^h269]: and they were mine, and they bare[^h3205] sons[^h1121] and daughters[^h1323]. Thus were their names[^h8034]; Samaria[^h8111] is Aholah[^h170], and Jerusalem[^h3389] Aholibah[^h172].  
###### 5
And Aholah[^h170] played the harlot[^h2181] when she was mine[^h8478]; and she doted[^h5689] on her lovers[^h157], on the Assyrians[^h804] her neighbours[^h7138],
###### 6
Which were clothed[^h3847] with blue[^h8504], captains[^h6346] and rulers[^h5461], all of them desirable[^h2531] young men[^h970], horsemen[^h6571] riding[^h7392] upon horses[^h5483].
###### 7
Thus she committed[^h5414] her whoredoms[^h8457] with them, with all them that were the chosen[^h4005] men[^h1121] of Assyria[^h804], and with all on whom she doted[^h5689]: with all their idols[^h1544] she defiled[^h2930] herself.  
###### 8
Neither left[^h5800] she her whoredoms[^h8457] brought from Egypt[^h4714]: for in her youth[^h5271] they lay[^h7901] with her, and they bruised[^h6213] the breasts[^h1717] of her virginity[^h1331], and poured[^h8210] their whoredom[^h8457] upon her.
###### 9
Wherefore I have delivered[^h5414] her into the hand[^h3027] of her lovers[^h157], into the hand[^h3027] of the Assyrians[^h1121] [^h804], upon whom she doted[^h5689].
###### 10
These discovered[^h1540] her nakedness[^h6172]: they took[^h3947] her sons[^h1121] and her daughters[^h1323], and slew[^h2026] her with the sword[^h2719]: and she became famous[^h8034] among women[^h802]; for they had executed[^h6213] judgment[^h8196] upon her. 
###### 11
And when her sister[^h269] Aholibah[^h172] saw[^h7200] this, she was more corrupt[^h7843] in her inordinate love[^h5691] than she, and in her whoredoms[^h8457] more than her sister[^h269] in her whoredoms[^h2183].  
###### 12
She doted[^h5689] upon the Assyrians[^h1121] [^h804] her neighbours[^h7138], captains[^h6346] and rulers[^h5461] clothed[^h3847] most gorgeously[^h4358], horsemen[^h6571] riding[^h7392] upon horses[^h5483], all of them desirable[^h2531] young men[^h970].
###### 13
Then I saw[^h7200] that she was defiled[^h2930], that they took both[^h8147] one[^h259] way[^h1870],
###### 14
And that she increased[^h3254] her whoredoms[^h8457]: for when she saw[^h7200] men[^h582] pourtrayed[^h2707] upon the wall[^h7023], the images[^h6754] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] pourtrayed[^h2710] with vermilion[^h8350],
###### 15
Girded[^h2289] with girdles[^h232] upon their loins[^h4975], exceeding[^h5628] in dyed attire[^h2871] upon their heads[^h7218], all of them princes[^h7991] to look to[^h4758], after the manner[^h1823] of the Babylonians[^h1121] [^h894] of Chaldea[^h3778], the land[^h776] of their nativity[^h4138]:
###### 16
And as soon as she saw[^h4758] them with her eyes[^h5869], she doted[^h5689] upon them, and sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto them into Chaldea[^h3778]. 
###### 17
And the Babylonians[^h1121] [^h894] came[^h935] to her into the bed[^h4904] of love[^h1730], and they defiled[^h2930] her with their whoredom[^h8457], and she was polluted[^h2930] with them, and her mind[^h5315] was alienated[^h3363] from them.  
###### 18
So she discovered[^h1540] her whoredoms[^h8457], and discovered[^h1540] her nakedness[^h6172]: then my mind[^h5315] was alienated[^h3363] from her, like as my mind[^h5315] was alienated[^h5361] from her sister[^h269].
###### 19
Yet she multiplied[^h7235] her whoredoms[^h8457], in calling to remembrance[^h2142] the days[^h3117] of her youth[^h5271], wherein she had played the harlot[^h2181] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714].
###### 20
For she doted[^h5689] upon their paramours[^h6370], whose flesh[^h1320] is as the flesh[^h1320] of asses[^h2543], and whose issue[^h2231] is like the issue[^h2231] of horses[^h5483].
###### 21
Thus thou calledst to remembrance[^h6485] the lewdness[^h2154] of thy youth[^h5271], in bruising[^h6213] thy teats[^h1717] by the Egyptians[^h4714] for the paps[^h7699] of thy youth[^h5271].
###### 22
Therefore, O Aholibah[^h172], thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will raise up[^h5782] thy lovers[^h157] against thee, from whom thy mind[^h5315] is alienated[^h5361], and I will bring[^h935] them against thee on every side[^h5439];
###### 23
The Babylonians[^h1121] [^h894], and all the Chaldeans[^h3778], Pekod[^h6489], and Shoa[^h7772], and Koa[^h6970], and all the Assyrians[^h1121] [^h804] with them: all of them desirable[^h2531] young men[^h970], captains[^h6346] and rulers[^h5461], great lords[^h7991] and renowned[^h7121], all of them riding[^h7392] upon horses[^h5483].
###### 24
And they shall come[^h935] against thee with chariots[^h2021], wagons[^h7393], and wheels[^h1534], and with an assembly[^h6951] of people[^h5971], which shall set[^h7760] against thee buckler[^h6793] and shield[^h4043] and helmet[^h6959] round about[^h5439]: and I will set[^h5414] judgment[^h4941] before[^h6440] them, and they shall judge[^h8199] thee according to their judgments[^h4941].
###### 25
And I will set[^h5414] my jealousy[^h7068] against thee, and they shall deal[^h6213] furiously[^h2534] with thee: they shall take away[^h5493] thy nose[^h639] and thine ears[^h241]; and thy remnant[^h319] shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719]: they shall take[^h3947] thy sons[^h1121] and thy daughters[^h1323]; and thy residue[^h319] shall be devoured[^h398] by the fire[^h784].
###### 26
They shall also strip[^h6584] thee out of thy clothes[^h899], and take away[^h3947] thy fair[^h8597] jewels[^h3627]. 
###### 27
Thus will I make thy lewdness[^h2154] to cease[^h7673] from thee, and thy whoredom[^h2184] brought from the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: so that thou shalt not lift up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] unto them, nor remember[^h2142] Egypt[^h4714] any more.
###### 28
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I will deliver[^h5414] thee into the hand[^h3027] of them whom thou hatest[^h8130], into the hand[^h3027] of them from whom thy mind[^h5315] is alienated[^h5361]:
###### 29
And they shall deal[^h6213] with thee hatefully[^h8135], and shall take away[^h3947] all thy labour[^h3018], and shall leave[^h5800] thee naked[^h5903] and bare[^h6181]: and the nakedness[^h6172] of thy whoredoms[^h2183] shall be discovered[^h1540], both thy lewdness[^h2154] and thy whoredoms[^h8457].
###### 30
I will do[^h6213] these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring[^h2181] after[^h310] the heathen[^h1471], and because thou art polluted[^h2930] with their idols[^h1544].
###### 31
Thou hast walked[^h1980] in the way[^h1870] of thy sister[^h269]; therefore will I give[^h5414] her cup[^h3563] into thine hand[^h3027].
###### 32
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Thou shalt drink[^h8354] of thy sister's[^h269] cup[^h3563] deep[^h6013] and large[^h7342]: thou shalt be laughed to scorn[^h6712] and had in derision[^h3933]; it containeth[^h3557] much[^h4767].
###### 33
Thou shalt be filled[^h4390] with drunkenness[^h7943] and sorrow[^h3015], with the cup[^h3563] of astonishment[^h8047] and desolation[^h8077], with the cup[^h3563] of thy sister[^h269] Samaria[^h8111].
###### 34
Thou shalt even drink[^h8354] it and suck it out[^h4680], and thou shalt break[^h1633] the sherds[^h2789] thereof, and pluck off[^h5423] thine own breasts[^h7699]: for I have spoken[^h1696] it, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 35
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Because thou hast forgotten[^h7911] me, and cast[^h7993] me behind[^h310] thy back[^h1458], therefore bear[^h5375] thou also thy lewdness[^h2154] and thy whoredoms[^h8457].
###### 36
The LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] moreover unto me; Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], wilt thou judge[^h8199] Aholah[^h170] and Aholibah[^h172]? yea, declare[^h5046] unto them their abominations[^h8441]; 
###### 37
That they have committed adultery[^h5003], and blood[^h1818] is in their hands[^h3027], and with their idols[^h1544] have they committed adultery[^h5003], and have also caused their sons[^h1121], whom they bare[^h3205] unto me, to pass for them through[^h5674] the fire, to devour[^h402] them.
###### 38
Moreover this they have done[^h6213] unto me: they have defiled[^h2930] my sanctuary[^h4720] in the same day[^h3117], and have profaned[^h2490] my sabbaths[^h7676].
###### 39
For when they had slain[^h7819] their children[^h1121] to their idols[^h1544], then they came[^h935] the same day[^h3117] into my sanctuary[^h4720] to profane[^h2490] it; and, lo, thus have they done[^h6213] in the midst[^h8432] of mine house[^h1004].
###### 40
And furthermore[^h637], that ye have sent[^h7971] for men[^h582] to come[^h935] from far[^h4801], unto whom a messenger[^h4397] was sent[^h7971]; and, lo, they came[^h935]: for whom thou didst wash[^h7364] thyself, paintedst[^h3583] thy eyes[^h5869], and deckedst[^h5710] thyself with ornaments[^h5716], 
###### 41
And satest[^h3427] upon a stately[^h3520] bed[^h4296], and a table[^h7979] prepared[^h6186] before[^h6440] it, whereupon thou hast set[^h7760] mine incense[^h7004] and mine oil[^h8081]. 
###### 42
And a voice[^h6963] of a multitude[^h1995] being at ease[^h7961] was with her: and with the men[^h582] of the common sort[^h7230] [^h120] were brought[^h935] Sabeans[^h5436] [^h5433] from the wilderness[^h4057], which put[^h5414] bracelets[^h6781] upon their hands[^h3027], and beautiful[^h8597] crowns[^h5850] upon their heads[^h7218].  
###### 43
Then said[^h559] I unto her that was old[^h1087] in adulteries[^h5004], Will they now commit[^h2181] whoredoms[^h8457] with her, and she with them? 
###### 44
Yet they went in[^h935] unto her, as they go in[^h935] unto a woman[^h802] that playeth the harlot[^h2181]: so went they in[^h935] unto Aholah[^h170] and unto Aholibah[^h172], the lewd[^h2154] women[^h802].
###### 45
And the righteous[^h6662] men[^h582], they shall judge[^h8199] them after the manner[^h4941] of adulteresses[^h5003], and after the manner[^h4941] of women that shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]; because they are adulteresses[^h5003], and blood[^h1818] is in their hands[^h3027].
###### 46
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; I will bring up[^h5927] a company[^h6951] upon them, and will give[^h5414] them to be removed[^h2189] and spoiled[^h957]. 
###### 47
And the company[^h6951] shall stone[^h7275] them with stones[^h68], and dispatch[^h1254] them with their swords[^h2719]; they shall slay[^h2026] their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323], and burn up[^h8313] their houses[^h1004] with fire[^h784]. 
###### 48
Thus will I cause lewdness[^h2154] to cease[^h7673] out of the land[^h776], that all women[^h802] may be taught[^h3256] not to do[^h6213] after your lewdness[^h2154].
###### 49
And they shall recompense[^h5414] your lewdness[^h2154] upon you, and ye shall bear[^h5375] the sins[^h2399] of your idols[^h1544]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

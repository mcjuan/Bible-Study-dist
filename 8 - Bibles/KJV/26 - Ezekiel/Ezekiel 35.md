###### 1
Moreover the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], set[^h7760] thy face[^h6440] against mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], and prophesy[^h5012] against it,
###### 3
And say[^h559] unto it, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, O mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], I am against thee, and I will stretch out[^h5186] mine hand[^h3027] against thee, and I will make[^h5414] thee most[^h4923] desolate[^h8077]. 
###### 4
I will lay[^h7760] thy cities[^h5892] waste[^h2723], and thou shalt be desolate[^h8077], and thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
Because thou hast had a perpetual[^h5769] hatred[^h342], and hast shed[^h5064] the blood of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] by the force[^h3027] of the sword[^h2719] in the time[^h6256] of their calamity[^h343], in the time[^h6256] that their iniquity[^h5771] had an end[^h7093]:   
###### 6
Therefore, as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], I will prepare[^h6213] thee unto blood[^h1818], and blood[^h1818] shall pursue[^h7291] thee: sith[^h518] thou hast not hated[^h8130] blood[^h1818], even blood[^h1818] shall pursue[^h7291] thee.
###### 7
Thus will I make[^h5414] mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165] most[^h8077] desolate[^h8077], and cut off[^h3772] from it him that passeth out[^h5674] and him that returneth[^h7725]. 
###### 8
And I will fill[^h4390] his mountains[^h2022] with his slain[^h2491] men: in thy hills[^h1389], and in thy valleys[^h1516], and in all thy rivers[^h650], shall they fall[^h5307] that are slain[^h2491] with the sword[^h2719].
###### 9
I will make[^h5414] thee perpetual[^h5769] desolations[^h8077], and thy cities[^h5892] shall not return[^h7725] [^h3427]: and ye shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
Because thou hast said[^h559], These two[^h8147] nations[^h1471] and these two[^h8147] countries[^h776] shall be mine, and we will possess[^h3423] it; whereas the LORD[^h3068] was there: 
###### 11
Therefore, as I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], I will even do[^h6213] according to thine anger[^h639], and according to thine envy[^h7068] which thou hast used[^h6213] out of thy hatred[^h8135] against them; and I will make myself known[^h3045] among them, when I have judged[^h8199] thee.
###### 12
And thou shalt know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], and that I have heard[^h8085] all thy blasphemies[^h5007] which thou hast spoken[^h559] against the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], They are laid desolate[^h8074] [^h8077], they are given[^h5414] us to consume[^h402]. 
###### 13
Thus with your mouth[^h6310] ye have boasted[^h1431] against me, and have multiplied[^h6280] your words[^h1697] against me: I have heard[^h8085] them. 
###### 14
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; When the whole earth[^h776] rejoiceth[^h8055], I will make[^h6213] thee desolate[^h8077].
###### 15
As thou didst rejoice[^h8057] at the inheritance[^h5159] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], because it was desolate[^h8074], so will I do[^h6213] unto thee: thou shalt be desolate[^h8077], O mount[^h2022] Seir[^h8165], and all Idumea[^h123], even all of it: and they shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068].

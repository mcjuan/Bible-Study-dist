###### 1
He cried[^h7121] also in mine ears[^h241] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963], saying[^h559], Cause them that have charge[^h6486] over the city[^h5892] to draw near[^h7126], even every man[^h376] with his destroying[^h4892] weapon[^h3627] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 2
And, behold, six[^h8337] men[^h582] came[^h935] from the way[^h1870] of the higher[^h5945] gate[^h8179], which lieth[^h6437] toward the north[^h6828], and every man[^h376] a slaughter[^h4660] weapon[^h3627] in his hand[^h3027]; and one[^h259] man[^h376] among[^h8432] them was clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906], with a writer's[^h5608] inkhorn[^h7083] by his side[^h4975]: and they went in[^h935], and stood[^h5975] beside[^h681] the brasen[^h5178] altar[^h4196].   
###### 3
And the glory[^h3519] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] was gone up[^h5927] from the cherub[^h3742], whereupon he was, to the threshold[^h4670] of the house[^h1004]. And he called[^h7121] to the man[^h376] clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906], which had the writer's[^h5608] inkhorn[^h7083] by his side[^h4975];
###### 4
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto him, Go through[^h5674] the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892], through the midst[^h8432] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and set[^h8427] a mark[^h8420] upon the foreheads[^h4696] of the men[^h582] that sigh[^h584] and that cry[^h602] for all the abominations[^h8441] that be done[^h6213] in the midst[^h8432] thereof. 
###### 5
And to the others[^h428] he said[^h559] in mine hearing[^h241], Go[^h5674] ye after[^h310] him through the city[^h5892], and smite[^h5221]: let not your eye[^h5869] spare[^h2347], neither have ye pity[^h2550]: 
###### 6
Slay[^h2026] utterly[^h4889] old[^h2205] and young[^h970], both maids[^h1330], and little children[^h2945], and women[^h802]: but come not near[^h5066] any man[^h376] upon whom is the mark[^h8420]; and begin[^h2490] at my sanctuary[^h4720]. Then they began[^h2490] at the ancient[^h2205] men[^h582] which were before[^h6440] the house[^h1004]. 
###### 7
And he said[^h559] unto them, Defile[^h2930] the house[^h1004], and fill[^h4390] the courts[^h2691] with the slain[^h2491]: go ye forth[^h3318]. And they went forth[^h3318], and slew[^h5221] in the city[^h5892].
###### 8
And it came to pass, while they were slaying[^h5221] them, and I was left[^h7604], that I fell[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440], and cried[^h2199], and said[^h559], Ah[^h162] Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]! wilt thou destroy[^h7843] all the residue[^h7611] of Israel[^h3478] in thy pouring out[^h8210] of thy fury[^h2534] upon Jerusalem[^h3389]?
###### 9
Then said[^h559] he unto me, The iniquity[^h5771] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063] is exceeding[^h3966] [^h3966] great[^h1419], and the land[^h776] is full[^h4390] of blood[^h1818], and the city[^h5892] full[^h4390] of perverseness[^h4297]: for they say[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] hath forsaken[^h5800] the earth[^h776], and the LORD[^h3068] seeth[^h7200] not.  
###### 10
And as for me also, mine eye[^h5869] shall not spare[^h2347], neither will I have pity[^h2550], but I will recompense[^h5414] their way[^h1870] upon their head[^h7218].
###### 11
And, behold, the man[^h376] clothed[^h3847] with linen[^h906], which had the inkhorn[^h7083] by his side[^h4975], reported[^h7725] the matter[^h1697], saying[^h559], I have done[^h6213] as thou hast commanded[^h6680] me.

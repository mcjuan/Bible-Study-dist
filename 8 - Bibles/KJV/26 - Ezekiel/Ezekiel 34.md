###### 1
And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], prophesy[^h5012] against the shepherds[^h7462] of Israel[^h3478], prophesy[^h5012], and say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] unto the shepherds[^h7462]; Woe[^h1945] be to the shepherds[^h7462] of Israel[^h3478] that do feed[^h7462] themselves! should not the shepherds[^h7462] feed[^h7462] the flocks[^h6629]?
###### 3
Ye eat[^h398] the fat[^h2459], and ye clothe[^h3847] you with the wool[^h6785], ye kill[^h2076] them that are fed[^h1277]: but ye feed[^h7462] not the flock[^h6629].
###### 4
The diseased[^h2470] have ye not strengthened[^h2388], neither have ye healed[^h7495] that which was sick[^h2470], neither have ye bound up[^h2280] that which was broken[^h7665], neither have ye brought again[^h7725] that which was driven away[^h5080], neither have ye sought[^h1245] that which was lost[^h6]; but with force[^h2394] and with cruelty[^h6531] have ye ruled[^h7287] them.
###### 5
And they were scattered[^h6327], because there is no shepherd[^h7462]: and they became meat[^h402] to all the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], when they were scattered[^h6327]. 
###### 6
My sheep[^h6629] wandered[^h7686] through all the mountains[^h2022], and upon every high[^h7311] hill[^h1389]: yea, my flock[^h6629] was scattered[^h6327] upon all the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h776], and none did search[^h1875] or seek[^h1245] after them.
###### 7
Therefore, ye shepherds[^h7462], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068];
###### 8
As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], surely because my flock[^h6629] became a prey[^h957], and my flock[^h6629] became meat[^h402] to every beast[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], because there was no shepherd[^h7462], neither did my shepherds[^h7462] search[^h1875] for my flock[^h6629], but the shepherds[^h7462] fed[^h7462] themselves, and fed[^h7462] not my flock[^h6629];
###### 9
Therefore, O ye shepherds[^h7462], hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068];
###### 10
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I am against the shepherds[^h7462]; and I will require[^h1875] my flock[^h6629] at their hand[^h3027], and cause them to cease[^h7673] from feeding[^h7462] the flock[^h6629]; neither shall the shepherds[^h7462] feed[^h7462] themselves any more; for I will deliver[^h5337] my flock[^h6629] from their mouth[^h6310], that they may not be meat[^h402] for them.
###### 11
For thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I, even I, will both search[^h1875] my sheep[^h6629], and seek them out[^h1239].
###### 12
As a shepherd[^h7462] seeketh out[^h1243] his flock[^h5739] in the day[^h3117] that he is among[^h8432] his sheep[^h6629] that are scattered[^h6567]; so will I seek out[^h1239] my sheep[^h6629], and will deliver[^h5337] them out of all places[^h4725] where they have been scattered[^h6327] in the cloudy[^h6051] and dark[^h6205] day[^h3117]. 
###### 13
And I will bring them out[^h3318] from the people[^h5971], and gather[^h6908] them from the countries[^h776], and will bring[^h935] them to their own land[^h127], and feed[^h7462] them upon the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478] by the rivers[^h650], and in all the inhabited places[^h4186] of the country[^h776].
###### 14
I will feed[^h7462] them in a good[^h2896] pasture[^h4829], and upon the high[^h4791] mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478] shall their fold[^h5116] be: there shall they lie[^h7257] in a good[^h2896] fold[^h5116], and in a fat[^h8082] pasture[^h4829] shall they feed[^h7462] upon the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 15
I will feed[^h7462] my flock[^h6629], and I will cause them to lie down[^h7257], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 16
I will seek[^h1245] that which was lost[^h6], and bring again[^h7725] that which was driven away[^h5080], and will bind up[^h2280] that which was broken[^h7665], and will strengthen[^h2388] that which was sick[^h2470]: but I will destroy[^h8045] the fat[^h8082] and the strong[^h2389]; I will feed[^h7462] them with judgment[^h4941].
###### 17
And as for you[^h859], O my flock[^h6629], thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Behold, I judge[^h8199] between cattle[^h7716] and cattle[^h7716], between the rams[^h352] and the he goats[^h6260].  
###### 18
Seemeth it a small thing[^h4592] unto you to have eaten up[^h7462] the good[^h2896] pasture[^h4829], but ye must tread down[^h7429] with your feet[^h7272] the residue[^h3499] of your pastures[^h4829]? and to have drunk[^h8354] of the deep[^h4950] waters[^h4325], but ye must foul[^h7515] the residue[^h3498] with your feet[^h7272]?
###### 19
And as for my flock[^h6629], they eat[^h7462] that which ye have trodden[^h4823] with your feet[^h7272]; and they drink[^h8354] that which ye have fouled[^h4833] with your feet[^h7272].
###### 20
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge[^h8199] between the fat[^h1274] cattle[^h7716] and between the lean[^h7330] cattle[^h7716].
###### 21
Because ye have thrust[^h1920] with side[^h6654] and with shoulder[^h3802], and pushed[^h5055] all the diseased[^h2470] with your horns[^h7161], till ye have scattered[^h6327] them abroad[^h2351];
###### 22
Therefore will I save[^h3467] my flock[^h6629], and they shall no more be a prey[^h957]; and I will judge[^h8199] between cattle[^h7716] and cattle[^h7716].
###### 23
And I will set up[^h6965] one[^h259] shepherd[^h7462] over them, and he shall feed[^h7462] them, even my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732]; he shall feed[^h7462] them, and he shall be their shepherd[^h7462].
###### 24
And I the LORD[^h3068] will be their God[^h430], and my servant[^h5650] David[^h1732] a prince[^h5387] among[^h8432] them; I the LORD[^h3068] have spoken[^h1696] it.
###### 25
And I will make[^h3772] with them a covenant[^h1285] of peace[^h7965], and will cause the evil[^h7451] beasts[^h2416] to cease[^h7673] out of the land[^h776]: and they shall dwell[^h3427] safely[^h983] in the wilderness[^h4057], and sleep[^h3462] in the woods[^h3293] [^h3264].
###### 26
And I will make[^h5414] them and the places round about[^h5439] my hill[^h1389] a blessing[^h1293]; and I will cause the shower[^h1653] to come down[^h3381] in his season[^h6256]; there shall be showers[^h1653] of blessing[^h1293].
###### 27
And the tree[^h6086] of the field[^h7704] shall yield[^h5414] her fruit[^h6529], and the earth[^h776] shall yield[^h5414] her increase[^h2981], and they shall be safe[^h983] in their land[^h127], and shall know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I have broken[^h7665] the bands[^h4133] of their yoke[^h5923], and delivered[^h5337] them out of the hand[^h3027] of those that served[^h5647] themselves of them.
###### 28
And they shall no more be a prey[^h957] to the heathen[^h1471], neither shall the beast[^h2416] of the land[^h776] devour[^h398] them; but they shall dwell[^h3427] safely[^h983], and none shall make them afraid[^h2729].
###### 29
And I will raise up[^h6965] for them a plant[^h4302] of renown[^h8034], and they shall be no more consumed[^h622] with hunger[^h7458] in the land[^h776], neither bear[^h5375] the shame[^h3639] of the heathen[^h1471] any more.  
###### 30
Thus shall they know[^h3045] that I the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430] am with them, and that they, even the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], are my people[^h5971], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].
###### 31
And ye[^h859] my flock[^h6629], the flock[^h6629] of my pasture[^h4830], are men[^h120], and I am your God[^h430], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

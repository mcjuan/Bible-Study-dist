###### 1
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141], in the fourth[^h7243] month, in the fifth[^h2568] day of the month[^h2320], as I was among[^h8432] the captives[^h1473] by the river[^h5104] of Chebar[^h3529], that the heavens[^h8064] were opened[^h6605], and I saw[^h7200] visions[^h4759] of God[^h430]. 
###### 2
In the fifth[^h2568] day of the month[^h2320], which was the fifth[^h2549] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Jehoiachin's[^h3112] captivity[^h1546],
###### 3
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came expressly unto Ezekiel[^h3168] the priest[^h3548], the son[^h1121] of Buzi[^h941], in the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] by the river[^h5104] Chebar[^h3529]; and the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was there upon him. 
###### 4
And I looked[^h7200], and, behold, a whirlwind[^h7307] [^h5591] came[^h935] out of the north[^h6828], a great[^h1419] cloud[^h6051], and a fire[^h784] infolding[^h3947] itself, and a brightness[^h5051] was about[^h5439] it, and out of the midst[^h8432] thereof as the colour[^h5869] of amber[^h2830], out of the midst[^h8432] of the fire[^h784]. 
###### 5
Also out of the midst[^h8432] thereof came the likeness[^h1823] of four[^h702] living creatures[^h2416]. And this was their appearance[^h4758]; they[^h2007] had the likeness[^h1823] of a man[^h120].
###### 6
And every one[^h259] had four[^h702] faces[^h6440], and every one[^h259] had four[^h702] wings[^h3671].
###### 7
And their feet[^h7272] were straight[^h3477] feet[^h7272]; and the sole[^h3709] of their feet[^h7272] was like the sole[^h3709] of a calf's[^h5695] foot[^h7272]: and they sparkled[^h5340] like the colour[^h5869] of burnished[^h7044] brass[^h5178]. 
###### 8
And they had the hands[^h3027] of a man[^h120] under their wings[^h3671] on their four[^h702] sides[^h7253]; and they four[^h702] had their faces[^h6440] and their wings[^h3671].
###### 9
Their wings[^h3671] were joined[^h2266] one[^h802] to another[^h269]; they turned[^h5437] not when they went[^h3212]; they went[^h3212] every one[^h376] straight[^h5676] forward[^h6440].
###### 10
As for the likeness[^h1823] of their faces[^h6440], they four[^h702] had the face[^h6440] of a man[^h120], and the face[^h6440] of a lion[^h738], on the right side[^h3225]: and they four[^h702] had the face[^h6440] of an ox[^h7794] on the left side[^h8040]; they four[^h702] also had the face[^h6440] of an eagle[^h5404].
###### 11
Thus were their faces[^h6440]: and their wings[^h3671] were stretched[^h6504] upward[^h4605]; two[^h8147] wings of every one[^h376] were joined[^h2266] one[^h376] to another[^h376], and two[^h8147] covered[^h3680] their bodies[^h1472]. 
###### 12
And they went[^h3212] every one[^h376] straight[^h5676] forward[^h6440]: whither the spirit[^h7307] was to go[^h3212], they went[^h3212]; and they turned[^h5437] not when they went[^h3212].
###### 13
As for the likeness[^h1823] of the living creatures[^h2416], their appearance[^h4758] was like burning[^h1197] coals[^h1513] of fire[^h784], and like the appearance[^h4758] of lamps[^h3940]: it went up and down[^h1980] among the living creatures[^h2416]; and the fire[^h784] was bright[^h5051], and out of the fire[^h784] went forth[^h3318] lightning[^h1300].
###### 14
And the living creatures[^h2416] ran[^h7519] and returned[^h7725] as the appearance[^h4758] of a flash of lightning[^h965].
###### 15
Now as I beheld[^h7200] the living creatures[^h2416], behold one[^h259] wheel[^h212] upon the earth[^h776] by[^h681] the living creatures[^h2416], with his four[^h702] faces[^h6440].
###### 16
The appearance[^h4758] of the wheels[^h212] and their work[^h4639] was like unto the colour[^h5869] of a beryl[^h8658]: and they four[^h702] had one[^h259] likeness[^h1823]: and their appearance[^h4758] and their work[^h4639] was as it were a wheel[^h212] in the middle[^h8432] of a wheel[^h212].
###### 17
When they went[^h3212], they went[^h3212] upon their four[^h702] sides[^h7253]: and they turned[^h5437] not when they went[^h3212].
###### 18
As for their rings[^h1354], they were so high[^h1363] that they were dreadful[^h3374]; and their rings[^h1354] were full[^h4392] of eyes[^h5869] round about[^h5439] them four[^h702]. 
###### 19
And when the living creatures[^h2416] went[^h3212], the wheels[^h212] went[^h3212] by them[^h681]: and when the living creatures[^h2416] were lifted up[^h5375] from the earth[^h776], the wheels[^h212] were lifted up[^h5375].
###### 20
Whithersoever the spirit[^h7307] was to go[^h3212], they went[^h3212], thither was their spirit[^h7307] to go[^h3212]; and the wheels[^h212] were lifted up[^h5375] over against[^h5980] them: for the spirit[^h7307] of the living creature[^h2416] was in the wheels[^h212]. 
###### 21
When those went[^h3212], these went[^h3212]; and when those stood[^h5975], these stood[^h5975]; and when those were lifted up[^h5375] from the earth[^h776], the wheels[^h212] were lifted up[^h5375] over against[^h5980] them: for the spirit[^h7307] of the living creature[^h2416] was in the wheels[^h212]. 
###### 22
And the likeness[^h1823] of the firmament[^h7549] upon the heads[^h7218] of the living creature[^h2416] was as the colour[^h5869] of the terrible[^h3372] crystal[^h7140], stretched forth[^h5186] over their heads[^h7218] above[^h4605].
###### 23
And under the firmament[^h7549] were their wings[^h3671] straight[^h3477], the one[^h802] toward the other[^h269]: every one[^h376] had two[^h8147], which covered[^h3680] on this side[^h2007], and every one[^h376] had two[^h8147], which covered[^h3680] on that side[^h2007], their bodies[^h1472].
###### 24
And when they went[^h3212], I heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of their wings[^h3671], like the noise[^h6963] of great[^h7227] waters[^h4325], as the voice[^h6963] of the Almighty[^h7706], the voice[^h6963] of speech[^h1999], as the noise[^h6963] of an host[^h4264]: when they stood[^h5975], they let down[^h7503] their wings[^h3671].
###### 25
And there was a voice[^h6963] from the firmament[^h7549] that was over their heads[^h7218], when they stood[^h5975], and had let down[^h7503] their wings[^h3671].
###### 26
And above[^h4605] the firmament[^h7549] that was over their heads[^h7218] was the likeness[^h1823] of a throne[^h3678], as the appearance[^h4758] of a sapphire[^h5601] stone[^h68]: and upon the likeness[^h1823] of the throne[^h3678] was the likeness[^h1823] as the appearance[^h4758] of a man[^h120] above[^h4605] upon it.
###### 27
And I saw[^h7200] as the colour[^h5869] of amber[^h2830], as the appearance[^h4758] of fire[^h784] round about[^h5439] within[^h1004] it, from the appearance[^h4758] of his loins[^h4975] even upward[^h4605], and from the appearance[^h4758] of his loins[^h4975] even downward[^h4295], I saw[^h7200] as it were the appearance[^h4758] of fire[^h784], and it had brightness[^h5051] round about[^h5439].
###### 28
As the appearance[^h4758] of the bow[^h7198] that is in the cloud[^h6051] in the day[^h3117] of rain[^h1653], so was the appearance[^h4758] of the brightness[^h5051] round about[^h5439]. This was the appearance[^h4758] of the likeness[^h1823] of the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068]. And when I saw[^h7200] it, I fell[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440], and I heard[^h8085] a voice[^h6963] of one that spake[^h1696].

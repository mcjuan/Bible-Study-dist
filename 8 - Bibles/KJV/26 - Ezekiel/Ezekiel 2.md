###### 1
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], stand[^h5975] upon thy feet[^h7272], and I will speak[^h1696] unto thee.
###### 2
And the spirit[^h7307] entered[^h935] into me when he spake[^h1696] unto me, and set[^h5975] me upon my feet[^h7272], that I heard[^h8085] him that spake[^h1696] unto me.
###### 3
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], I send[^h7971] thee to the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], to a rebellious[^h4775] nation[^h1471] that hath rebelled[^h4775] against me: they and their fathers[^h1] have transgressed[^h6586] against me, even unto this very[^h6106] day[^h3117]. 
###### 4
For they are impudent[^h7186] [^h6440] children[^h1121] and stiffhearted[^h2389] [^h3820]. I do send[^h7971] thee unto them; and thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]. 
###### 5
And they, whether they will hear[^h8085], or whether they will forbear[^h2308], (for they are a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004],) yet shall know[^h3045] that there hath been a prophet[^h5030] among[^h8432] them.
###### 6
And thou, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], be not afraid[^h3372] of them, neither be afraid[^h3372] of their words[^h1697], though briers[^h5621] and thorns[^h5544] be with thee, and thou dost dwell[^h3427] among scorpions[^h6137]: be not afraid[^h3372] of their words[^h1697], nor be dismayed[^h2865] at their looks[^h6440], though they be a rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004]. 
###### 7
And thou shalt speak[^h1696] my words[^h1697] unto them, whether they will hear[^h8085], or whether they will forbear[^h2308]: for they are most rebellious[^h4805]. 
###### 8
But thou, son[^h1121] of man[^h120], hear[^h8085] what I say[^h1696] unto thee; Be not[^h1961] thou rebellious[^h4805] like that rebellious[^h4805] house[^h1004]: open[^h6475] thy mouth[^h6310], and eat[^h398] that I give[^h5414] thee.
###### 9
And when I looked[^h7200], behold, an hand[^h3027] was sent[^h7971] unto me; and, lo, a roll[^h4039] of a book[^h5612] was therein;
###### 10
And he spread[^h6566] it before[^h6440] me; and it was written[^h3789] within[^h6440] and without[^h268]: and there was written[^h3789] therein lamentations[^h7015], and mourning[^h1899], and woe[^h1958].

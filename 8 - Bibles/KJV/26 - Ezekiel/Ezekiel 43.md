###### 1
Afterward he brought[^h3212] me to the gate[^h8179], even the gate[^h8179] that looketh[^h6437] toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921]:
###### 2
And, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] came[^h935] from the way[^h1870] of the east[^h6921]: and his voice[^h6963] was like a noise[^h6963] of many[^h7227] waters[^h4325]: and the earth[^h776] shined[^h215] with his glory[^h3519].
###### 3
And it was according to the appearance[^h4758] of the vision[^h4758] which I saw[^h7200], even according to the vision[^h4758] that I saw[^h7200] when I came[^h935] to destroy[^h7843] the city[^h5892]: and the visions[^h4759] were like the vision[^h4758] that I saw[^h7200] by the river[^h5104] Chebar[^h3529]; and I fell[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440]. 
###### 4
And the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h935] into the house[^h1004] by the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] whose prospect[^h6440] is toward[^h1870] the east[^h6921].
###### 5
So the spirit[^h7307] took me up[^h5375], and brought[^h935] me into the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691]; and, behold, the glory[^h3519] of the LORD[^h3068] filled[^h4390] the house[^h1004].
###### 6
And I heard[^h8085] him speaking[^h1696] unto me out of the house[^h1004]; and the man[^h376] stood[^h5975] by me[^h681].
###### 7
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], the place[^h4725] of my throne[^h3678], and the place[^h4725] of the soles[^h3709] of my feet[^h7272], where I will dwell[^h7931] in the midst[^h8432] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] for ever[^h5769], and my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034], shall the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] no more defile[^h2930], neither they, nor their kings[^h4428], by their whoredom[^h2184], nor by the carcases[^h6297] of their kings[^h4428] in their high places[^h1116].
###### 8
In their setting[^h5414] of their threshold[^h5592] by my thresholds[^h5592], and their post[^h4201] by[^h681] my posts[^h4201], and the wall[^h7023] between me and them, they have even defiled[^h2930] my holy[^h6944] name[^h8034] by their abominations[^h8441] that they have committed[^h6213]: wherefore I have consumed[^h3615] them in mine anger[^h639]. 
###### 9
Now let them put away[^h7368] their whoredom[^h2184], and the carcases[^h6297] of their kings[^h4428], far[^h7368] from me, and I will dwell[^h7931] in the midst[^h8432] of them for ever[^h5769].
###### 10
Thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], shew[^h5046] the house[^h1004] to the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], that they may be ashamed[^h3637] of their iniquities[^h5771]: and let them measure[^h4058] the pattern[^h8508]. 
###### 11
And if they be ashamed[^h3637] of all that they have done[^h6213], shew[^h3045] them the form[^h6699] of the house[^h1004], and the fashion[^h8498] thereof, and the goings out[^h4161] thereof, and the comings[^h4126] in thereof, and all the forms[^h6699] thereof, and all the ordinances[^h2708] thereof, and all the forms[^h6699] thereof, and all the laws[^h8451] thereof: and write[^h3789] it in their sight[^h5869], that they may keep[^h8104] the whole form[^h6699] thereof, and all the ordinances[^h2708] thereof, and do[^h6213] them.
###### 12
This is the law[^h8451] of the house[^h1004]; Upon the top[^h7218] of the mountain[^h2022] the whole limit[^h1366] thereof round about[^h5439] shall be most[^h6944] holy[^h6944]. Behold, this is the law[^h8451] of the house[^h1004].
###### 13
And these are the measures[^h4060] of the altar[^h4196] after the cubits[^h520]: The cubit[^h520] is a cubit[^h520] and an hand breadth[^h2948]; even the bottom[^h2436] shall be a cubit[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] a cubit[^h520], and the border[^h1366] thereof by the edge[^h8193] thereof round about[^h5439] shall be a[^h259] span[^h2239]: and this shall be the higher place[^h1354] of the altar[^h4196].  
###### 14
And from the bottom[^h2436] upon the ground[^h776] even to the lower[^h8481] settle[^h5835] shall be two[^h8147] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] one[^h259] cubit[^h520]; and from the lesser[^h6996] settle[^h5835] even to the greater[^h1419] settle[^h5835] shall be four[^h702] cubits[^h520], and the breadth[^h7341] one cubit[^h520].
###### 15
So the altar[^h741] [^h2025] shall be four[^h702] cubits[^h520]; and from the altar[^h741] and upward[^h4605] shall be four[^h702] horns[^h7161].  
###### 16
And the altar[^h741] shall be twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] cubits long[^h753], twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] broad[^h7341], square[^h7251] in the four[^h702] squares[^h7253] thereof.
###### 17
And the settle[^h5835] shall be fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] cubits long[^h753] and fourteen[^h702] [^h6240] broad[^h7341] in the four[^h702] squares[^h7253] thereof; and the border[^h1366] about[^h5439] it shall be half[^h2677] a cubit[^h520]; and the bottom[^h2436] thereof shall be a cubit[^h520] about[^h5439]; and his stairs[^h4609] shall look[^h6437] toward the east[^h6921].
###### 18
And he said[^h559] unto me, Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; These are the ordinances[^h2708] of the altar[^h4196] in the day[^h3117] when they shall make[^h6213] it, to offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] thereon, and to sprinkle[^h2236] blood[^h1818] thereon.
###### 19
And thou shalt give[^h5414] to the priests[^h3548] the Levites[^h3881] that be of the seed[^h2233] of Zadok[^h6659], which approach[^h7138] unto me, to minister[^h8334] unto me, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] for a sin offering[^h2403].
###### 20
And thou shalt take[^h3947] of the blood[^h1818] thereof, and put[^h5414] it on the four[^h702] horns[^h7161] of it, and on the four[^h702] corners[^h6438] of the settle[^h5835], and upon the border[^h1366] round about[^h5439]: thus shalt thou cleanse[^h2398] and purge[^h3722] it.
###### 21
Thou shalt take[^h3947] the bullock[^h6499] also of the sin offering[^h2403], and he shall burn[^h8313] it in the appointed place[^h4662] of the house[^h1004], without[^h2351] the sanctuary[^h4720].
###### 22
And on the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] thou shalt offer[^h7126] a kid[^h8163] of the goats[^h5795] without blemish[^h8549] for a sin offering[^h2403]; and they shall cleanse[^h2398] the altar[^h4196], as they did cleanse[^h2398] it with the bullock[^h6499].
###### 23
When thou hast made an end[^h3615] of cleansing[^h2398] it, thou shalt offer[^h7126] a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] without blemish[^h8549], and a ram[^h352] out of the flock[^h6629] without blemish[^h8549].
###### 24
And thou shalt offer[^h7126] them before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and the priests[^h3548] shall cast[^h7993] salt[^h4417] upon them, and they shall offer them up[^h5927] for a burnt offering[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shalt thou prepare[^h6213] every day[^h3117] a goat[^h8163] for a sin offering[^h2403]: they shall also prepare[^h6213] a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499], and a ram[^h352] out of the flock[^h6629], without blemish[^h8549].
###### 26
Seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shall they purge[^h3722] the altar[^h4196] and purify[^h2891] it; and they shall consecrate themselves[^h4390] [^h3027]. 
###### 27
And when these days[^h3117] are expired[^h3615], it shall be, that upon the eighth[^h8066] day[^h3117], and so forward[^h1973], the priests[^h3548] shall make[^h6213] your burnt offerings[^h5930] upon the altar[^h4196], and your peace offerings[^h8002]; and I will accept[^h7521] you, saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069].

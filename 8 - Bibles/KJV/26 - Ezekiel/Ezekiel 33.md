###### 1
Again the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], speak[^h1696] to the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971], and say[^h559] unto them, When I bring[^h935] the sword[^h2719] upon a land[^h776], if the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] take[^h3947] a[^h259] man[^h376] of their coasts[^h7097], and set[^h5414] him for their watchman[^h6822]: 
###### 3
If when he seeth[^h7200] the sword[^h2719] come[^h935] upon the land[^h776], he blow[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782], and warn[^h2094] the people[^h5971];
###### 4
Then whosoever[^h8085] heareth[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], and taketh not warning[^h2094]; if the sword[^h2719] come[^h935], and take him away[^h3947], his blood[^h1818] shall be upon his own head[^h7218]. 
###### 5
He heard[^h8085] the sound[^h6963] of the trumpet[^h7782], and took not warning[^h2094]; his blood[^h1818] shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning[^h2094] shall deliver[^h4422] his soul[^h5315].
###### 6
But if the watchman[^h6822] see[^h7200] the sword[^h2719] come[^h935], and blow[^h8628] not the trumpet[^h7782], and the people[^h5971] be not warned[^h2094]; if the sword[^h2719] come[^h935], and take[^h3947] any person[^h5315] from among them, he is taken away[^h3947] in his iniquity[^h5771]; but his blood[^h1818] will I require[^h1875] at the watchman's[^h6822] hand[^h3027].
###### 7
So thou, O son[^h1121] of man[^h120], I have set[^h5414] thee a watchman[^h6822] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; therefore thou shalt hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] at my mouth[^h6310], and warn[^h2094] them from me.
###### 8
When I say[^h559] unto the wicked[^h7563], O wicked[^h7563] man, thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]; if thou dost not speak[^h1696] to warn[^h2094] the wicked[^h7563] from his way[^h1870], that wicked[^h7563] man shall die[^h4191] in his iniquity[^h5771]; but his blood[^h1818] will I require[^h1245] at thine hand[^h3027].
###### 9
Nevertheless, if thou warn[^h2094] the wicked[^h7563] of his way[^h1870] to turn[^h7725] from it; if he do not turn[^h7725] from his way[^h1870], he shall die[^h4191] in his iniquity[^h5771]; but thou hast delivered[^h5337] thy soul[^h5315].
###### 10
Therefore, O thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], speak[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]; Thus ye speak[^h559], saying[^h559], If our transgressions[^h6588] and our sins[^h2403] be upon us, and we pine away[^h4743] in them, how should we then live[^h2421]?
###### 11
Say[^h559] unto them, As I live[^h2416], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], I have no pleasure[^h2654] in the death[^h4194] of the wicked[^h7563]; but that the wicked[^h7563] turn[^h7725] from his way[^h1870] and live[^h2421]: turn[^h7725] ye, turn[^h7725] ye from your evil[^h7451] ways[^h1870]; for why will ye die[^h4191], O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 12
Therefore, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], say[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971], The righteousness[^h6666] of the righteous[^h6662] shall not deliver[^h5337] him in the day[^h3117] of his transgression[^h6588]: as for the wickedness[^h7564] of the wicked[^h7563], he shall not fall[^h3782] thereby in the day[^h3117] that he turneth[^h7725] from his wickedness[^h7562]; neither shall the righteous[^h6662] be able[^h3201] to live[^h2421] for his righteousness in the day[^h3117] that he sinneth[^h2398].
###### 13
When I shall say[^h559] to the righteous[^h6662], that he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421]; if he trust[^h982] to his own righteousness[^h6666], and commit[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766], all his righteousnesses[^h6666] shall not be remembered[^h2142]; but for his iniquity[^h5766] that he hath committed[^h6213], he shall die[^h4191] for it.
###### 14
Again, when I say[^h559] unto the wicked[^h7563], Thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]; if he turn[^h7725] from his sin[^h2403], and do[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666]; 
###### 15
If the wicked[^h7563] restore[^h7725] the pledge[^h2258], give again[^h7999] that he had robbed[^h1500], walk[^h1980] in the statutes[^h2708] of life[^h2416], without committing[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766]; he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421], he shall not die[^h4191].
###### 16
None of his sins[^h2403] that he hath committed[^h2398] shall be mentioned[^h2142] unto him: he hath done[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666]; he shall surely[^h2421] live[^h2421].
###### 17
Yet the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971] say[^h559], The way[^h1870] of the Lord[^h136] is not equal[^h8505]: but as for them, their way[^h1870] is not equal[^h8505].
###### 18
When the righteous[^h6662] turneth[^h7725] from his righteousness[^h6666], and committeth[^h6213] iniquity[^h5766], he shall even die[^h4191] thereby.
###### 19
But if the wicked[^h7563] turn[^h7725] from his wickedness[^h7564], and do[^h6213] that which is lawful[^h4941] and right[^h6666], he shall live[^h2421] thereby.
###### 20
Yet ye say[^h559], The way[^h1870] of the Lord[^h136] is not equal[^h8505]. O ye house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], I will judge[^h8199] you every one[^h376] after his ways[^h1870].
###### 21
And it came to pass in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of our captivity[^h1546], in the tenth[^h6224] month, in the fifth[^h2568] day of the month[^h2320], that one that had escaped[^h6412] out of Jerusalem[^h3389] came[^h935] unto me, saying[^h559], The city[^h5892] is smitten[^h5221].
###### 22
Now the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was upon me in the evening[^h6153], afore[^h6440] he that was escaped[^h6412] came[^h935]; and had opened[^h6605] my mouth[^h6310], until he came[^h935] to me in the morning[^h1242]; and my mouth[^h6310] was opened[^h6605], and I was no more dumb[^h481].
###### 23
Then the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 24
Son[^h1121] of man[^h120], they that inhabit[^h3427] those wastes[^h2723] of the land[^h127] of Israel[^h3478] speak[^h559], saying[^h559], Abraham[^h85] was one[^h259], and he inherited[^h3423] the land[^h776]: but we are many[^h7227]; the land[^h776] is given[^h5414] us for inheritance[^h4181].
###### 25
Wherefore say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; Ye eat[^h398] with the blood[^h1818], and lift up[^h5375] your eyes[^h5869] toward your idols[^h1544], and shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818]: and shall ye possess[^h3423] the land[^h776]?
###### 26
Ye stand[^h5975] upon your sword[^h2719], ye work[^h6213] abomination[^h8441], and ye defile[^h2930] every one[^h376] his neighbour's[^h7453] wife[^h802]: and shall ye possess[^h3423] the land[^h776]?
###### 27
Say[^h559] thou thus unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; As I live[^h2416], surely they that are in the wastes[^h2723] shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719], and him that is in the open[^h6440] field[^h7704] will I give[^h5414] to the beasts[^h2416] to be devoured[^h398], and they that be in the forts[^h4679] and in the caves[^h4631] shall die[^h4191] of the pestilence[^h1698]. 
###### 28
For I will lay[^h5414] the land[^h776] most[^h4923] desolate[^h8077], and the pomp[^h1347] of her strength[^h5797] shall cease[^h7673]; and the mountains[^h2022] of Israel[^h3478] shall be desolate[^h8074], that none shall pass through[^h5674]. 
###### 29
Then shall they know[^h3045] that I am the LORD[^h3068], when I have laid[^h5414] the land[^h776] most[^h4923] desolate[^h8077] because of all their abominations[^h8441] which they have committed[^h6213].
###### 30
Also, thou son[^h1121] of man[^h120], the children[^h1121] of thy people[^h5971] still are talking[^h1696] against[^h681] thee by the walls[^h7023] and in the doors[^h6607] of the houses[^h1004], and speak[^h1696] one[^h2297] to another[^h259], every one[^h376] to his brother[^h251], saying[^h559], Come[^h935], I pray you, and hear[^h8085] what is the word[^h1697] that cometh forth[^h3318] from the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 31
And they come[^h935] unto thee as the people[^h5971] cometh[^h3996], and they sit[^h3427] before[^h6440] thee as my people[^h5971], and they hear[^h8085] thy words[^h1697], but they will not do[^h6213] them: for with their mouth[^h6310] they shew[^h6213] much love[^h5690], but their heart[^h3820] goeth[^h1980] after[^h310] their covetousness[^h1215].   
###### 32
And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely[^h5690] song[^h7892] of one that hath a pleasant[^h3303] voice[^h6963], and can play well[^h2895] on an instrument[^h5059]: for they hear[^h8085] thy words[^h1697], but they do[^h6213] them not. 
###### 33
And when this cometh to pass[^h935], (lo, it will come[^h935],) then shall they know[^h3045] that a prophet[^h5030] hath been among[^h8432] them.

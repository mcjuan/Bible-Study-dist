###### 1
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; The gate[^h8179] of the inner[^h6442] court[^h2691] that looketh[^h6437] toward the east[^h6921] shall be shut[^h5462] the six[^h8337] working[^h4639] days[^h3117]; but on the sabbath[^h7676] [^h3117] it shall be opened[^h6605], and in the day[^h3117] of the new moon[^h2320] it shall be opened[^h6605].
###### 2
And the prince[^h5387] shall enter[^h935] by the way[^h1870] of the porch[^h197] of that gate[^h8179] without[^h2351], and shall stand[^h5975] by the post[^h4201] of the gate[^h8179], and the priests[^h3548] shall prepare[^h6213] his burnt offering[^h5930] and his peace offerings[^h8002], and he shall worship[^h7812] at the threshold[^h4670] of the gate[^h8179]: then he shall go forth[^h3318]; but the gate[^h8179] shall not be shut[^h5462] until the evening[^h6153].
###### 3
Likewise the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] shall worship[^h7812] at the door[^h6607] of this gate[^h8179] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] in the sabbaths[^h7676] and in the new moons[^h2320].
###### 4
And the burnt offering[^h5930] that the prince[^h5387] shall offer[^h7126] unto the LORD[^h3068] in the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117] shall be six[^h8337] lambs[^h3532] without blemish[^h8549], and a ram[^h352] without blemish[^h8549].
###### 5
And the meat offering[^h4503] shall be an ephah[^h374] for a ram[^h352], and the meat offering[^h4503] for the lambs[^h3532] as he shall be able[^h3027] to give[^h4991], and an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081] to an ephah[^h374]. 
###### 6
And in the day[^h3117] of the new moon[^h2320] it shall be a young[^h1121] [^h1241] bullock[^h6499] without blemish[^h8549], and six[^h8337] lambs[^h3532], and a ram[^h352]: they shall be without blemish[^h8549].
###### 7
And he shall prepare[^h6213] a meat offering[^h4503], an ephah[^h374] for a bullock[^h6499], and an ephah[^h374] for a ram[^h352], and for the lambs[^h3532] according as his hand[^h3027] shall attain[^h5381] unto, and an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081] to an ephah[^h374].
###### 8
And when the prince[^h5387] shall enter[^h935], he shall go[^h935] in by the way[^h1870] of the porch[^h197] of that gate[^h8179], and he shall go forth[^h3318] by the way[^h1870] thereof.
###### 9
But when the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776] shall come[^h935] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] in the solemn feasts[^h4150], he that entereth[^h935] in by the way[^h1870] of the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179] to worship[^h7812] shall go out[^h3318] by the way[^h1870] of the south[^h5045] gate[^h8179]; and he that entereth[^h935] by the way[^h1870] of the south[^h5045] gate[^h8179] shall go forth[^h3318] by the way[^h1870] of the north[^h6828] gate[^h8179]: he shall not return[^h7725] by the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] whereby he came in[^h935], but shall go forth[^h3318] over against[^h5226] it.
###### 10
And the prince[^h5387] in the midst[^h8432] of them, when they go in[^h935], shall go in[^h935]; and when they go forth[^h3318], shall go forth[^h3318].
###### 11
And in the feasts[^h2282] and in the solemnities[^h4150] the meat offering[^h4503] shall be an ephah[^h374] to a bullock[^h6499], and an ephah[^h374] to a ram[^h352], and to the lambs[^h3532] as he is able[^h3027] to give[^h4991], and an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081] to an ephah[^h374].
###### 12
Now when the prince[^h5387] shall prepare[^h6213] a voluntary[^h5071] burnt offering[^h5930] or peace offerings[^h8002] voluntarily[^h5071] unto the LORD[^h3068], one shall then open[^h6605] him the gate[^h8179] that looketh[^h6437] toward the east[^h6921], and he shall prepare[^h6213] his burnt offering[^h5930] and his peace offerings[^h8002], as he did[^h6213] on the sabbath[^h7676] day[^h3117]: then he shall go forth[^h3318]; and after[^h310] his going forth[^h3318] one shall shut[^h5462] the gate[^h8179].
###### 13
Thou shalt daily[^h3117] prepare[^h6213] a burnt offering[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068] of a lamb[^h3532] of the first[^h1121] year[^h8141] without blemish[^h8549]: thou shalt prepare[^h6213] it every[^h1242] morning[^h1242].  
###### 14
And thou shalt prepare[^h6213] a meat offering[^h4503] for it every morning[^h1242], the sixth part[^h8345] of an ephah[^h374], and the third part[^h7992] of an hin[^h1969] of oil[^h8081], to temper with[^h7450] the fine flour[^h5560]; a meat offering[^h4503] continually[^h8548] by a perpetual[^h5769] ordinance[^h2708] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
Thus shall they prepare[^h6213] [^h6213] the lamb[^h3532], and the meat offering[^h4503], and the oil[^h8081], every morning[^h1242] for a continual[^h8548] burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 16
Thus saith[^h559] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]; If the prince[^h5387] give[^h5414] a gift[^h4979] unto any[^h376] of his sons[^h1121], the inheritance[^h5159] thereof shall be his sons'[^h1121]; it shall be their possession[^h272] by inheritance[^h5159].
###### 17
But if he give[^h5414] a gift[^h4979] of his inheritance[^h5159] to one[^h259] of his servants[^h5650], then it shall be his to the year[^h8141] of liberty[^h1865]; after it shall return[^h7725] to the prince[^h5387]: but his inheritance[^h5159] shall be his sons'[^h1121] for them.
###### 18
Moreover the prince[^h5387] shall not take[^h3947] of the people's[^h5971] inheritance[^h5159] by oppression[^h3238], to thrust[^h3238] them out of their possession[^h272]; but he shall give his sons[^h1121] inheritance[^h5157] out of his own possession[^h272]: that my people[^h5971] be not scattered[^h6327] every man[^h376] from his possession[^h272].
###### 19
After he brought[^h935] me through the entry[^h3996], which was at the side[^h3802] of the gate[^h8179], into the holy[^h6944] chambers[^h3957] of the priests[^h3548], which looked[^h6437] toward the north[^h6828]: and, behold, there was a place[^h4725] on the two sides[^h3411] westward[^h3220].
###### 20
Then said[^h559] he unto me, This is the place[^h4725] where the priests[^h3548] shall boil[^h1310] the trespass offering[^h817] and the sin offering[^h2403], where they shall bake[^h644] the meat offering[^h4503]; that they bear[^h3318] them not out into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], to sanctify[^h6942] the people[^h5971].
###### 21
Then he brought me forth[^h3318] into the utter[^h2435] court[^h2691], and caused me to pass by[^h5674] the four[^h702] corners[^h4740] of the court[^h2691]; and, behold, in every[^h4740] corner[^h4740] of the court[^h2691] [^h2691] there was a court[^h2691]. 
###### 22
In the four[^h702] corners[^h4740] of the court[^h2691] there were courts[^h2691] joined[^h7000] of forty[^h705] cubits long[^h753] and thirty[^h7970] broad[^h7341]: these four[^h702] corners[^h7106] were of one[^h259] measure[^h4060].  
###### 23
And there was a row[^h2905] of building round about[^h5439] in them, round about[^h5439] them four[^h702], and it was made[^h6213] with boiling places[^h4018] under the rows[^h2918] round about[^h5439].
###### 24
Then said[^h559] he unto me, These are the places[^h1004] of them that boil[^h1310], where the ministers[^h8334] of the house[^h1004] shall boil[^h1310] the sacrifice[^h2077] of the people[^h5971].

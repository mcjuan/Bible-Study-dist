###### 1
Oh that[^h5414] my head[^h7218] were waters[^h4325], and mine eyes[^h5869] a fountain[^h4726] of tears[^h1832], that I might weep[^h1058] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915] for the slain[^h2491] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971]! 
###### 2
Oh that[^h5414] I had in the wilderness[^h4057] a lodging place[^h4411] of wayfaring men[^h732]; that I might leave[^h5800] my people[^h5971], and go[^h3212] from them! for they be all adulterers[^h5003], an assembly[^h6116] of treacherous men[^h898].
###### 3
And they bend[^h1869] their tongues[^h3956] like their bow[^h7198] for lies[^h8267]: but they are not valiant[^h1396] for the truth[^h530] upon the earth[^h776]; for they proceed[^h3318] from evil[^h7451] to evil[^h7451], and they know[^h3045] not me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 4
Take ye heed[^h8104] every one[^h376] of his neighbour[^h7453], and trust[^h982] ye not in any brother[^h251]: for every brother[^h251] will utterly[^h6117] supplant[^h6117], and every neighbour[^h7453] will walk[^h1980] with slanders[^h7400]. 
###### 5
And they will deceive[^h2048] every one[^h376] his neighbour[^h7453], and will not speak[^h1696] the truth[^h571]: they have taught[^h3925] their tongue[^h3956] to speak[^h1696] lies[^h8267], and weary[^h3811] themselves to commit iniquity[^h5753]. 
###### 6
Thine habitation[^h3427] is in the midst[^h8432] of deceit[^h4820]; through deceit[^h4820] they refuse[^h3985] to know[^h3045] me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], Behold, I will melt[^h6884] them, and try[^h974] them; for how shall I do[^h6213] for[^h6440] the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971]?
###### 8
Their tongue[^h3956] is as an arrow[^h2671] shot out[^h7819]; it speaketh[^h1696] deceit[^h4820]: one speaketh[^h1696] peaceably[^h7965] to his neighbour[^h7453] with his mouth[^h6310], but in heart[^h7130] he layeth[^h7760] his wait[^h696].  
###### 9
Shall I not visit[^h6485] them for these things? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: shall not my soul[^h5315] be avenged[^h5358] on such a nation[^h1471] as this?
###### 10
For the mountains[^h2022] will I take up[^h5375] a weeping[^h1065] and wailing[^h5092], and for the habitations[^h4999] of the wilderness[^h4057] a lamentation[^h7015], because they are burned up[^h3341], so that none[^h376] can pass[^h5674] through them; neither can men hear[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the cattle[^h4735]; both the fowl[^h5775] of the heavens[^h8064] and the beast[^h929] are fled[^h5074]; they are gone[^h1980].   
###### 11
And I will make[^h5414] Jerusalem[^h3389] heaps[^h1530], and a den[^h4583] of dragons[^h8577]; and I will make[^h5414] the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] desolate[^h8077], without an inhabitant[^h3427]. 
###### 12
Who is the wise[^h2450] man[^h376], that may understand[^h995] this? and who is he to whom the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696], that he may declare[^h5046] it, for what the land[^h776] perisheth[^h6] and is burned up[^h3341] like a wilderness[^h4057], that none passeth through[^h5674]?
###### 13
And the LORD[^h3068] saith[^h559], Because they have forsaken[^h5800] my law[^h8451] which I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] them, and have not obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], neither walked[^h1980] therein;
###### 14
But have walked[^h3212] after[^h310] the imagination[^h8307] of their own heart[^h3820], and after[^h310] Baalim[^h1168], which their fathers[^h1] taught[^h3925] them: 
###### 15
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will feed[^h398] them, even this people[^h5971], with wormwood[^h3939], and give them water[^h4325] of gall[^h7219] to drink[^h8248].
###### 16
I will scatter[^h6327] them also among the heathen[^h1471], whom neither they nor their fathers[^h1] have known[^h3045]: and I will send[^h7971] a sword[^h2719] after[^h310] them, till I have consumed[^h3615] them.
###### 17
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], Consider[^h995] ye, and call[^h7121] for the mourning women[^h6969], that they may come[^h935]; and send[^h7971] for cunning[^h2450] women, that they may come[^h935]:
###### 18
And let them make haste[^h4116], and take up[^h5375] a wailing[^h5092] for us, that our eyes[^h5869] may run down[^h3381] with tears[^h1832], and our eyelids[^h6079] gush out[^h5140] with waters[^h4325].
###### 19
For a voice[^h6963] of wailing[^h5092] is heard[^h8085] out of Zion[^h6726], How are we spoiled[^h7703]! we are greatly[^h3966] confounded[^h954], because we have forsaken[^h5800] the land[^h776], because our dwellings[^h4908] have cast us out[^h7993].
###### 20
Yet hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], O ye women[^h802], and let your ear[^h241] receive[^h3947] the word[^h1697] of his mouth[^h6310], and teach[^h3925] your daughters[^h1323] wailing[^h5092], and every one[^h802] her neighbour[^h7468] lamentation[^h7015].
###### 21
For death[^h4194] is come up[^h5927] into our windows[^h2474], and is entered[^h935] into our palaces[^h759], to cut off[^h3772] the children[^h5768] from without[^h2351], and the young men[^h970] from the streets[^h7339].
###### 22
Speak[^h1696], Thus saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], Even the carcases[^h5038] of men[^h120] shall fall[^h5307] as dung[^h1828] upon the open[^h6440] field[^h7704], and as the handful[^h5995] after[^h310] the harvestman[^h7114], and none shall gather[^h622] them.
###### 23
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Let not the wise[^h2450] man glory[^h1984] in his wisdom[^h2451], neither let the mighty[^h1368] man glory[^h1984] in his might[^h1369], let not the rich[^h6223] man glory[^h1984] in his riches[^h6239]:
###### 24
But let him that glorieth[^h1984] glory[^h1984] in this, that he understandeth[^h7919] and knoweth[^h3045] me, that I am the LORD[^h3068] which exercise[^h6213] lovingkindness[^h2617], judgment[^h4941], and righteousness[^h6666], in the earth[^h776]: for in these things I delight[^h2654], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that I will punish[^h6485] all them which are circumcised[^h4135] with the uncircumcised[^h6190]; 
###### 26
Egypt[^h4714], and Judah[^h3063], and Edom[^h123], and the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and Moab[^h4124], and all that are in the utmost[^h7112] corners[^h6285], that dwell[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057]: for all these nations[^h1471] are uncircumcised[^h6189], and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] are uncircumcised[^h6189] in the heart[^h3820].

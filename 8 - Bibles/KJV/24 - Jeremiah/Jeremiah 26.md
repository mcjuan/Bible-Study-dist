###### 1
In the beginning[^h7225] of the reign[^h4468] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] came this word[^h1697] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Stand[^h5975] in the court[^h2691] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004], and speak[^h1696] unto all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], which come[^h935] to worship[^h7812] in the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004], all the words[^h1697] that I command[^h6680] thee to speak[^h1696] unto them; diminish[^h1639] not a word[^h1697]:
###### 3
If so be they will hearken[^h8085], and turn[^h7725] every man[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], that I may repent[^h5162] me of the evil[^h7451], which I purpose[^h2803] to do[^h6213] unto them because[^h6440] of the evil[^h7455] of their doings[^h4611].
###### 4
And thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; If ye will not hearken[^h8085] to me, to walk[^h3212] in my law[^h8451], which I have set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you,
###### 5
To hearken[^h8085] to the words[^h1697] of my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], whom I sent[^h7971] unto you, both rising up early[^h7925], and sending[^h7971] them, but ye have not hearkened[^h8085];
###### 6
Then will I make[^h5414] this house[^h1004] like Shiloh[^h7887], and will make[^h5414] this city[^h5892] a curse[^h7045] to all the nations[^h1471] of the earth[^h776].
###### 7
So the priests[^h3548] and the prophets[^h5030] and all the people[^h5971] heard[^h8085] Jeremiah[^h3414] speaking[^h1696] these words[^h1697] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah[^h3414] had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] all that the LORD[^h3068] had commanded[^h6680] him to speak[^h1696] unto all the people[^h5971], that the priests[^h3548] and the prophets[^h5030] and all the people[^h5971] took[^h8610] him, saying[^h559], Thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191].
###### 9
Why hast thou prophesied[^h5012] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], This house[^h1004] shall be like Shiloh[^h7887], and this city[^h5892] shall be desolate[^h2717] without an inhabitant[^h3427]? And all the people[^h5971] were gathered[^h6950] against Jeremiah[^h3414] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
When the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063] heard[^h8085] these things[^h1697], then they came up[^h5927] from the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004] unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and sat down[^h3427] in the entry[^h6607] of the new[^h2319] gate[^h8179] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house. 
###### 11
Then spake[^h559] the priests[^h3548] and the prophets[^h5030] unto the princes[^h8269] and to all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], This man[^h376] is worthy[^h4941] to die[^h4194]; for he hath prophesied[^h5012] against this city[^h5892], as ye have heard[^h8085] with your ears[^h241]. 
###### 12
Then spake[^h559] Jeremiah[^h3414] unto all the princes[^h8269] and to all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] me to prophesy[^h5012] against this house[^h1004] and against this city[^h5892] all the words[^h1697] that ye have heard[^h8085].
###### 13
Therefore now amend[^h3190] your ways[^h1870] and your doings[^h4611], and obey[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]; and the LORD[^h3068] will repent[^h5162] him of the evil[^h7451] that he hath pronounced[^h1696] against you.
###### 14
As for me, behold, I am in your hand[^h3027]: do[^h6213] with me as seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] and meet[^h3477] unto you. 
###### 15
But know[^h3045] ye for certain[^h3045], that if ye put me to death[^h4191], ye shall surely bring[^h5414] innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818] upon yourselves, and upon this city[^h5892], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof: for of a truth[^h571] the LORD[^h3068] hath sent[^h7971] me unto you to speak[^h1696] all these words[^h1697] in your ears[^h241].
###### 16
Then said[^h559] the princes[^h8269] and all the people[^h5971] unto the priests[^h3548] and to the prophets[^h5030]; This man[^h376] is not worthy[^h4941] to die[^h4194]: for he hath spoken[^h1696] to us in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].
###### 17
Then rose up[^h6965] certain[^h582] of the elders[^h2205] of the land[^h776], and spake[^h559] to all the assembly[^h6951] of the people[^h5971], saying[^h559],
###### 18
Micah[^h4320] the Morasthite[^h4183] prophesied[^h5012] in the days[^h3117] of Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and spake[^h559] to all the people[^h5971] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; Zion[^h6726] shall be plowed[^h2790] like a field[^h7704], and Jerusalem[^h3389] shall become heaps[^h5856], and the mountain[^h2022] of the house[^h1004] as the high places[^h1116] of a forest[^h3293].
###### 19
Did Hezekiah[^h2396] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and all Judah[^h3063] put him at all[^h4191] to death[^h4191]? did he not fear[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], and besought[^h2470] the LORD[^h3068] [^h6440], and the LORD[^h3068] repented[^h5162] him of the evil[^h7451] which he had pronounced[^h1696] against them? Thus[^h587] might we procure[^h6213] great[^h1419] evil[^h7451] against our souls[^h5315]. 
###### 20
And there was also a man[^h376] that prophesied[^h5012] in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], Urijah[^h223] the son[^h1121] of Shemaiah[^h8098] of Kirjathjearim[^h7157], who prophesied[^h5012] against this city[^h5892] and against this land[^h776] according to all the words[^h1697] of Jeremiah[^h3414]:
###### 21
And when Jehoiakim[^h3079] the king[^h4428], with all his mighty men[^h1368], and all the princes[^h8269], heard[^h8085] his words[^h1697], the king[^h4428] sought[^h1245] to put him to death[^h4191]: but when Urijah[^h223] heard[^h8085] it, he was afraid[^h3372], and fled[^h1272], and went[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714];
###### 22
And Jehoiakim[^h3079] the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] men[^h582] into Egypt[^h4714], namely, Elnathan[^h494] the son[^h1121] of Achbor[^h5907], and certain men[^h582] with him into Egypt[^h4714].
###### 23
And they fetched forth[^h3318] Urijah[^h223] out of Egypt[^h4714], and brought[^h935] him unto Jehoiakim[^h3079] the king[^h4428]; who slew[^h5221] him with the sword[^h2719], and cast[^h7993] his dead body[^h5038] into the graves[^h6913] of the common[^h1121] people[^h5971]. 
###### 24
Nevertheless the hand[^h3027] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227] was with Jeremiah[^h3414], that they should not give[^h5414] him into the hand[^h3027] of the people[^h5971] to put him to death[^h4191].

###### 1
The word[^h1697] that the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696] against Babylon[^h894] and against the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] by[^h3027] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030]. 
###### 2
Declare[^h5046] ye among the nations[^h1471], and publish[^h8085], and set up[^h5375] a standard[^h5251]; publish[^h8085], and conceal[^h3582] not: say[^h559], Babylon[^h894] is taken[^h3920], Bel[^h1078] is confounded[^h3001], Merodach[^h4781] is broken in pieces[^h2865]; her idols[^h6091] are confounded[^h3001], her images[^h1544] are broken in pieces[^h2865]. 
###### 3
For out of the north[^h6828] there cometh up[^h5927] a nation[^h1471] against her, which shall make[^h7896] her land[^h776] desolate[^h8047], and none shall dwell[^h3427] therein: they shall remove[^h5110], they shall depart[^h1980], both man[^h120] and beast[^h929].
###### 4
In those days[^h3117], and in that time[^h6256], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] shall come[^h935], they and the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] together[^h3162], going[^h1980] and weeping[^h1058]: they shall go[^h3212], and seek[^h1245] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].
###### 5
They shall ask[^h7592] the way[^h1870] to Zion[^h6726] with their faces[^h6440] thitherward[^h2008], saying, Come[^h935], and let us join[^h3867] ourselves to the LORD[^h3068] in a perpetual[^h5769] covenant[^h1285] that shall not be forgotten[^h7911].
###### 6
My people[^h5971] hath been lost[^h6] sheep[^h6629]: their shepherds[^h7462] have caused them to go astray[^h8582], they have turned them away[^h7725] [^h7726] on the mountains[^h2022]: they have gone[^h1980] from mountain[^h2022] to hill[^h1389], they have forgotten[^h7911] their restingplace[^h7258]. 
###### 7
All that found[^h4672] them have devoured[^h398] them: and their adversaries[^h6862] said[^h559], We offend[^h816] not, because they have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], the habitation[^h5116] of justice[^h6664], even the LORD[^h3068], the hope[^h4723] of their fathers[^h1].
###### 8
Remove[^h5110] out of the midst[^h8432] of Babylon[^h894], and go forth[^h3318] [^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], and be as the he goats[^h6260] before[^h6440] the flocks[^h6629].
###### 9
For, lo, I will raise[^h5782] and cause to come up[^h5927] against Babylon[^h894] an assembly[^h6951] of great[^h1419] nations[^h1471] from the north[^h6828] country[^h776]: and they shall set themselves in array[^h6186] against her; from thence she shall be taken[^h3920]: their arrows[^h2671] shall be as of a mighty[^h1368] expert man[^h7919] [^h7921]; none shall return[^h7725] in vain[^h7387]. 
###### 10
And Chaldea[^h3778] shall be a spoil[^h7998]: all that spoil[^h7997] her shall be satisfied[^h7646], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 11
Because ye were glad[^h8055], because ye rejoiced[^h5937], O ye destroyers[^h8154] of mine heritage[^h5159], because ye are grown fat[^h6335] as the heifer[^h5697] at grass[^h1877] [^h1758], and bellow[^h6670] as bulls[^h47];  
###### 12
Your mother[^h517] shall be sore[^h3966] confounded[^h954]; she that bare[^h3205] you shall be ashamed[^h2659]: behold, the hindermost[^h319] of the nations[^h1471] shall be a wilderness[^h4057], a dry land[^h6723], and a desert[^h6160].
###### 13
Because of the wrath[^h7110] of the LORD[^h3068] it shall not be inhabited[^h3427], but it shall be wholly desolate[^h8077]: every one that goeth[^h5674] by Babylon[^h894] shall be astonished[^h8074], and hiss[^h8319] at all her plagues[^h4347].
###### 14
Put yourselves in array[^h6186] against Babylon[^h894] round about[^h5439]: all ye that bend[^h1869] the bow[^h7198], shoot[^h3034] at her, spare[^h2550] no arrows[^h2671]: for she hath sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
Shout[^h7321] against her round about[^h5439]: she hath given[^h5414] her hand[^h3027]: her foundations[^h803] are fallen[^h5307], her walls[^h2346] are thrown down[^h2040]: for it is the vengeance[^h5360] of the LORD[^h3068]: take vengeance[^h5358] upon her; as she hath done[^h6213], do[^h6213] unto her.
###### 16
Cut off[^h3772] the sower[^h2232] from Babylon[^h894], and him that handleth[^h8610] the sickle[^h4038] in the time[^h6256] of harvest[^h7105]: for fear[^h6440] of the oppressing[^h3238] sword[^h2719] they shall turn[^h6437] every one[^h376] to his people[^h5971], and they shall flee[^h5127] every one[^h376] to his own land[^h776]. 
###### 17
Israel[^h3478] is a scattered[^h6340] sheep[^h7716]; the lions[^h738] have driven him away[^h5080]: first[^h7223] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804] hath devoured[^h398] him; and last[^h314] this Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] hath broken his bones[^h6105].
###### 18
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will punish[^h6485] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] and his land[^h776], as I have punished[^h6485] the king[^h4428] of Assyria[^h804].
###### 19
And I will bring[^h7725] Israel[^h3478] again[^h7725] to his habitation[^h5116], and he shall feed[^h7462] on Carmel[^h3760] and Bashan[^h1316], and his soul[^h5315] shall be satisfied[^h7646] upon mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669] and Gilead[^h1568].
###### 20
In those days[^h3117], and in that time[^h6256], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], the iniquity[^h5771] of Israel[^h3478] shall be sought for[^h1245], and there shall be none; and the sins[^h2403] of Judah[^h3063], and they shall not be found[^h4672]: for I will pardon[^h5545] them whom I reserve[^h7604].
###### 21
Go up[^h5927] against the land[^h776] of Merathaim[^h4850], even against it, and against the inhabitants[^h3427] of Pekod[^h6489]: waste[^h2717] and utterly destroy[^h2763] after[^h310] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and do[^h6213] according to all that I have commanded[^h6680] thee.  
###### 22
A sound[^h6963] of battle[^h4421] is in the land[^h776], and of great[^h1419] destruction[^h7667].
###### 23
How is the hammer[^h6360] of the whole earth[^h776] cut asunder[^h1438] and broken[^h7665]! how is Babylon[^h894] become a desolation[^h8047] among the nations[^h1471]!
###### 24
I have laid a snare[^h3369] for thee, and thou art also taken[^h3920], O Babylon[^h894], and thou wast not aware[^h3045]: thou art found[^h4672], and also caught[^h8610], because thou hast striven[^h1624] against the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
The LORD[^h3068] hath opened[^h6605] his armoury[^h214], and hath brought forth[^h3318] the weapons[^h3627] of his indignation[^h2195]: for this is the work[^h4399] of the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of hosts[^h6635] in the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778].
###### 26
Come[^h935] against her from the utmost border[^h7093], open[^h6605] her storehouses[^h3965]: cast her up[^h5549] as heaps[^h6194], and destroy her utterly[^h2763]: let nothing of her be left[^h7611].  
###### 27
Slay[^h2717] all her bullocks[^h6499]; let them go down[^h3381] to the slaughter[^h2874]: woe[^h1945] unto them! for their day[^h3117] is come[^h935], the time[^h6256] of their visitation[^h6486].
###### 28
The voice[^h6963] of them that flee[^h5127] and escape out[^h6405] of the land[^h776] of Babylon[^h894], to declare[^h5046] in Zion[^h6726] the vengeance[^h5360] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], the vengeance[^h5360] of his temple[^h1964].
###### 29
Call together[^h8085] the archers[^h7228] against Babylon[^h894]: all ye that bend[^h1869] the bow[^h7198], camp[^h2583] against it round about[^h5439]; let none thereof escape[^h6413]: recompense[^h7999] her according to her work[^h6467]; according to all that she hath done[^h6213], do[^h6213] unto her: for she hath been proud[^h2102] against the LORD[^h3068], against the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 30
Therefore shall her young men[^h970] fall[^h5307] in the streets[^h7339], and all her men[^h582] of war[^h4421] shall be cut off[^h1826] in that day[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 31
Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud[^h2087], saith[^h5002] the Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] of hosts[^h6635]: for thy day[^h3117] is come[^h935], the time[^h6256] that I will visit[^h6485] thee. 
###### 32
And the most proud[^h2087] shall stumble[^h3782] and fall[^h5307], and none shall raise him up[^h6965]: and I will kindle[^h3341] a fire[^h784] in his cities[^h5892], and it shall devour[^h398] all round about[^h5439] him. 
###### 33
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; The children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] were oppressed[^h6231] together[^h3162]: and all that took them captives[^h7617] held them fast[^h2388]; they refused[^h3985] to let them go[^h7971].
###### 34
Their Redeemer[^h1350] is strong[^h2389]; the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is his name[^h8034]: he shall throughly[^h7378] plead[^h7378] their cause[^h7379], that he may give rest[^h7280] to the land[^h776], and disquiet[^h7264] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 35
A sword[^h2719] is upon the Chaldeans[^h3778], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] of Babylon[^h894], and upon her princes[^h8269], and upon her wise[^h2450] men.
###### 36
A sword[^h2719] is upon the liars[^h907]; and they shall dote[^h2973]: a sword[^h2719] is upon her mighty men[^h1368]; and they shall be dismayed[^h2865]. 
###### 37
A sword[^h2719] is upon their horses[^h5483], and upon their chariots[^h7393], and upon all the mingled people[^h6153] that are in the midst[^h8432] of her; and they shall become as women[^h802]: a sword[^h2719] is upon her treasures[^h214]; and they shall be robbed[^h962].
###### 38
A drought[^h2721] is upon her waters[^h4325]; and they shall be dried up[^h3001]: for it is the land[^h776] of graven images[^h6456], and they are mad[^h1984] upon their idols[^h367].
###### 39
Therefore the wild beasts of the desert[^h6728] with the wild beasts of the islands[^h338] shall dwell[^h3427] there, and the owls[^h1323] [^h3284] shall dwell[^h3427] therein: and it shall be no more inhabited[^h3427] for ever[^h5331]; neither shall it be dwelt[^h7931] in from generation[^h1755] to generation[^h1755].
###### 40
As God[^h430] overthrew[^h4114] Sodom[^h5467] and Gomorrah[^h6017] and the neighbour[^h7934] cities thereof, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; so shall no man[^h376] abide[^h3427] there, neither shall any son[^h1121] of man[^h120] dwell[^h1481] therein.
###### 41
Behold, a people[^h5971] shall come[^h935] from the north[^h6828], and a great[^h1419] nation[^h1471], and many[^h7227] kings[^h4428] shall be raised up[^h5782] from the coasts[^h3411] of the earth[^h776].
###### 42
They shall hold[^h2388] the bow[^h7198] and the lance[^h3591]: they are cruel[^h394], and will not shew mercy[^h7355]: their voice[^h6963] shall roar[^h1993] like the sea[^h3220], and they shall ride[^h7392] upon horses[^h5483], every one put in array[^h6186], like a man[^h376] to the battle[^h4421], against thee, O daughter[^h1323] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 43
The king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] hath heard[^h8085] the report[^h8088] of them, and his hands[^h3027] waxed feeble[^h7503]: anguish[^h6869] took hold[^h2388] of him, and pangs[^h2427] as of a woman in travail[^h3205].
###### 44
Behold, he shall come up[^h5927] like a lion[^h738] from the swelling[^h1347] of Jordan[^h3383] unto the habitation[^h5116] of the strong[^h386]: but I will make[^h7323] them suddenly[^h7280] run away[^h7323] [^h7323] from her: and who is a chosen[^h977] man, that I may appoint[^h6485] over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time[^h3259]? and who is that shepherd[^h7462] that will stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] me? 
###### 45
Therefore hear[^h8085] ye the counsel[^h6098] of the LORD[^h3068], that he hath taken[^h3289] against Babylon[^h894]; and his purposes[^h4284], that he hath purposed[^h2803] against the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]: Surely the least[^h6810] of the flock[^h6629] shall draw them out[^h5498]: surely he shall make their habitation[^h5116] desolate[^h8074] with them.
###### 46
At the noise[^h6963] of the taking[^h8610] of Babylon[^h894] the earth[^h776] is moved[^h7493], and the cry[^h2201] is heard[^h8085] among the nations[^h1471].

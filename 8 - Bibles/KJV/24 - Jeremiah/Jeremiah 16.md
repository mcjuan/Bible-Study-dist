###### 1
The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came also unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 2
Thou shalt not take[^h3947] thee a wife[^h802], neither shalt thou have sons[^h1121] or daughters[^h1323] in this place[^h4725].
###### 3
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] concerning the sons[^h1121] and concerning the daughters[^h1323] that are born[^h3205] in this place[^h4725], and concerning their mothers[^h517] that bare[^h3205] them, and concerning their fathers[^h1] that begat[^h3209] them in this land[^h776];
###### 4
They shall die[^h4191] of grievous[^h8463] deaths[^h4463]; they shall not be lamented[^h5594]; neither shall they be buried[^h6912]; but they shall be as dung[^h1828] upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127]: and they shall be consumed[^h3615] by the sword[^h2719], and by famine[^h7458]; and their carcases[^h5038] shall be meat[^h3978] for the fowls[^h5775] of heaven[^h8064], and for the beasts[^h929] of the earth[^h776].
###### 5
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Enter[^h935] not into the house[^h1004] of mourning[^h4798], neither go[^h3212] to lament[^h5594] nor bemoan[^h5110] them: for I have taken away[^h622] my peace[^h7965] from this people[^h5971], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], even lovingkindness[^h2617] and mercies[^h7356]. 
###### 6
Both the great[^h1419] and the small[^h6996] shall die[^h4191] in this land[^h776]: they shall not be buried[^h6912], neither shall men lament[^h5594] for them, nor cut[^h1413] themselves, nor make themselves bald[^h7139] for them:
###### 7
Neither shall men tear[^h6536] themselves for them in mourning[^h60], to comfort[^h5162] them for the dead[^h4191]; neither shall men give them the cup[^h3563] of consolation[^h8575] to drink[^h8248] for their father[^h1] or for their mother[^h517]. 
###### 8
Thou shalt not also go[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of feasting[^h4960], to sit[^h3427] with them to eat[^h398] and to drink[^h8354].
###### 9
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will cause to cease[^h7673] out of this place[^h4725] in your eyes[^h5869], and in your days[^h3117], the voice[^h6963] of mirth[^h8342], and the voice[^h6963] of gladness[^h8057], the voice[^h6963] of the bridegroom[^h2860], and the voice[^h6963] of the bride[^h3618].
###### 10
And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew[^h5046] this people[^h5971] all these words[^h1697], and they shall say[^h559] unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD[^h3068] pronounced[^h1696] all this great[^h1419] evil[^h7451] against us? or what is our iniquity[^h5771]? or what is our sin[^h2403] that we have committed[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430]?
###### 11
Then shalt thou say[^h559] unto them, Because your fathers[^h1] have forsaken[^h5800] me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and have walked[^h3212] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430], and have served[^h5647] them, and have worshipped[^h7812] them, and have forsaken[^h5800] me, and have not kept[^h8104] my law[^h8451];
###### 12
And ye have done[^h6213] worse[^h7489] than your fathers[^h1]; for, behold[^h2009], ye walk[^h1980] every one[^h376] after[^h310] the imagination[^h8307] of his evil[^h7451] heart[^h3820], that they may not hearken[^h8085] unto me: 
###### 13
Therefore will I cast[^h2904] you out of this land[^h776] into a land[^h776] that ye know[^h3045] not, neither ye nor your fathers[^h1]; and there shall ye serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430] day[^h3119] and night[^h3915]; where I will not shew[^h5414] you favour[^h2594].
###### 14
Therefore, behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that it shall no more be said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], that brought up[^h5927] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714];
###### 15
But, The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], that brought up[^h5927] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] from the land[^h776] of the north[^h6828], and from all the lands[^h776] whither he had driven[^h5080] them: and I will bring them again[^h7725] into their land[^h127] that I gave[^h5414] unto their fathers[^h1].
###### 16
Behold, I will send[^h7971] for many[^h7227] fishers[^h1771] [^h1728], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and they shall fish[^h1770] them; and after[^h310] will I send[^h7971] for many[^h7227] hunters[^h6719], and they shall hunt[^h6679] them from every mountain[^h2022], and from every hill[^h1389], and out of the holes[^h5357] of the rocks[^h5553].
###### 17
For mine eyes[^h5869] are upon all their ways[^h1870]: they are not hid[^h5641] from my face[^h6440], neither is their iniquity[^h5771] hid[^h6845] from[^h5048] mine eyes[^h5869].
###### 18
And first[^h7223] I will recompense[^h7999] their iniquity[^h5771] and their sin[^h2403] double[^h4932]; because they have defiled[^h2490] my land[^h776], they have filled[^h4390] mine inheritance[^h5159] with the carcases[^h5038] of their detestable[^h8251] and abominable things[^h8441].
###### 19
O LORD[^h3068], my strength[^h5797], and my fortress[^h4581], and my refuge[^h4498] in the day[^h3117] of affliction[^h6869], the Gentiles[^h1471] shall come[^h935] unto thee from the ends[^h657] of the earth[^h776], and shall say[^h559], Surely our fathers[^h1] have inherited[^h5157] lies[^h8267], vanity[^h1892], and things wherein there is no profit[^h3276].
###### 20
Shall a man[^h120] make[^h6213] gods[^h430] unto himself, and they are no gods[^h430]?
###### 21
Therefore, behold, I will this once[^h6471] cause them to know[^h3045], I will cause them to know[^h3045] mine hand[^h3027] and my might[^h1369]; and they shall know[^h3045] that my name[^h8034] is The LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
The word[^h1697] that came to Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068] in the tenth[^h6224] year[^h8141] of Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], which was the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019].
###### 2
For then the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] army[^h2428] besieged[^h6696] Jerusalem[^h3389]: and Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] was shut up[^h3607] in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307], which was in the king[^h4428] of Judah's[^h3063] house[^h1004].
###### 3
For Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had shut him up[^h3607], saying[^h559], Wherefore dost thou prophesy[^h5012], and say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will give[^h5414] this city[^h5892] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall take[^h3920] it;
###### 4
And Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] shall not escape[^h4422] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], but shall surely[^h5414] be delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and shall speak[^h1696] with him mouth[^h6310] to mouth[^h6310], and his eyes[^h5869] shall behold[^h7200] his eyes[^h5869];
###### 5
And he shall lead[^h3212] Zedekiah[^h6667] to Babylon[^h894], and there shall he be until I visit[^h6485] him, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: though ye fight[^h3898] with the Chaldeans[^h3778], ye shall not prosper[^h6743].
###### 6
And Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559], The word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 7
Behold, Hanameel[^h2601] the son[^h1121] of Shallum[^h7967] thine uncle[^h1730] shall come[^h935] unto thee, saying[^h559], Buy[^h7069] thee my field[^h7704] that is in Anathoth[^h6068]: for the right[^h4941] of redemption[^h1353] is thine to buy[^h7069] it.
###### 8
So Hanameel[^h2601] mine uncle's[^h1730] son[^h1121] came[^h935] to me in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307] according to the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559] unto me, Buy[^h7069] my field[^h7704], I pray thee, that is in Anathoth[^h6068], which is in the country[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144]: for the right[^h4941] of inheritance[^h3425] is thine, and the redemption[^h1353] is thine; buy[^h7069] it for thyself. Then I knew[^h3045] that this was the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 9
And I bought[^h7069] the field[^h7704] of Hanameel[^h2601] my uncle's[^h1730] son[^h1121], that was in Anathoth[^h6068], and weighed[^h8254] him the money[^h3701], even seventeen[^h7651] [^h6235] shekels[^h8255] of silver[^h3701]. 
###### 10
And I subscribed[^h3789] the evidence[^h5612], and sealed[^h2856] it, and took[^h5749] witnesses[^h5707], and weighed[^h8254] him the money[^h3701] in the balances[^h3976]. 
###### 11
So I took[^h3947] the evidence[^h5612] of the purchase[^h4736], both that which was sealed[^h2856] according to the law[^h4687] and custom[^h2706], and that which was open[^h1540]:
###### 12
And I gave[^h5414] the evidence[^h5612] of the purchase[^h4736] unto Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374], the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4271], in the sight[^h5869] of Hanameel[^h2601] mine uncle's[^h1730] son, and in the presence[^h5869] of the witnesses[^h5707] that subscribed[^h3789] the book[^h5612] of the purchase[^h4736], before[^h5869] all the Jews[^h3064] that sat[^h3427] in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307].
###### 13
And I charged[^h6680] Baruch[^h1263] before[^h5869] them, saying[^h559],
###### 14
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Take[^h3947] these evidences[^h5612], this evidence[^h5612] of the purchase[^h4736], both which is sealed[^h2856], and this evidence[^h5612] which is open[^h1540]; and put[^h5414] them in an earthen[^h2789] vessel[^h3627], that they may continue[^h5975] many[^h7227] days[^h3117].
###### 15
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Houses[^h1004] and fields[^h7704] and vineyards[^h3754] shall be possessed again[^h7069] in this land[^h776].
###### 16
Now when[^h310] I had delivered[^h5414] the evidence[^h5612] of the purchase[^h4736] unto Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374], I prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 17
Ah[^h162] Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069]! behold, thou hast made[^h6213] the heaven[^h8064] and the earth[^h776] by thy great[^h1419] power[^h3581] and stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h2220], and there is nothing[^h1697] too hard[^h6381] for thee: 
###### 18
Thou shewest[^h6213] lovingkindness[^h2617] unto thousands[^h505], and recompensest[^h7999] the iniquity[^h5771] of the fathers[^h1] into the bosom[^h2436] of their children[^h1121] after[^h310] them: the Great[^h1419], the Mighty[^h1368] God[^h410], the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], is his name[^h8034],
###### 19
Great[^h1419] in counsel[^h6098], and mighty[^h7227] in work[^h5950]: for thine eyes[^h5869] are open[^h6491] upon all the ways[^h1870] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120]: to give[^h5414] every one[^h376] according to his ways[^h1870], and according to the fruit[^h6529] of his doings[^h4611]: 
###### 20
Which hast set[^h7760] signs[^h226] and wonders[^h4159] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], even unto this day[^h3117], and in Israel[^h3478], and among other men[^h120]; and hast made[^h6213] thee a name[^h8034], as at this day[^h3117];
###### 21
And hast brought forth[^h3318] thy people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] with signs[^h226], and with wonders[^h4159], and with a strong[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and with a stretched out[^h5186] arm[^h248], and with great[^h1419] terror[^h4172];
###### 22
And hast given[^h5414] them this land[^h776], which thou didst swear[^h7650] to their fathers[^h1] to give[^h5414] them, a land[^h776] flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706];
###### 23
And they came in[^h935], and possessed[^h3423] it; but they obeyed[^h8085] not thy voice[^h6963], neither walked[^h1980] in thy law[^h8451]; they have done[^h6213] nothing of all that thou commandedst[^h6680] them to do[^h6213]: therefore thou hast caused all this evil[^h7451] to come[^h7122] upon them:
###### 24
Behold the mounts[^h5550], they are come[^h935] unto the city[^h5892] to take[^h3920] it; and the city[^h5892] is given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], that fight[^h3898] against it, because[^h6440] of the sword[^h2719], and of the famine[^h7458], and of the pestilence[^h1698]: and what thou hast spoken[^h1696] is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest[^h7200] it. 
###### 25
And thou hast said[^h559] unto me, O Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069], Buy[^h7069] thee the field[^h7704] for money[^h3701], and take[^h5749] witnesses[^h5707]; for the city[^h5892] is given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]. 
###### 26
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 27
Behold, I am the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of all flesh[^h1320]: is there any thing[^h1697] too hard[^h6381] for me?
###### 28
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will give[^h5414] this city[^h5892] into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], and into the hand[^h3027] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall take[^h3920] it:
###### 29
And the Chaldeans[^h3778], that fight[^h3898] against this city[^h5892], shall come[^h935] and set[^h3341] fire[^h784] on this city[^h5892], and burn[^h8313] it with the houses[^h1004], upon whose roofs[^h1406] they have offered incense[^h6999] unto Baal[^h1168], and poured out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], to provoke me to anger[^h3707].
###### 30
For the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063] have only done[^h6213] evil[^h7451] before[^h5869] me from their youth[^h5271]: for the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] have only provoked me to anger[^h3707] with the work[^h4639] of their hands[^h3027], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 31
For this city[^h5892] hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger[^h639] and of my fury[^h2534] from the day[^h3117] that they built[^h1129] it even unto this day[^h3117]; that I should remove[^h5493] it from before my face[^h6440], 
###### 32
Because of all the evil[^h7451] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] and of the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063], which they have done[^h6213] to provoke me to anger[^h3707], they, their kings[^h4428], their princes[^h8269], their priests[^h3548], and their prophets[^h5030], and the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 33
And they have turned[^h6437] unto me the back[^h6203], and not the face[^h6440]: though I taught[^h3925] them, rising up early[^h7925] and teaching[^h3925] them, yet they have not hearkened[^h8085] to receive[^h3947] instruction[^h4148]. 
###### 34
But they set[^h7760] their abominations[^h8251] in the house[^h1004], which is called[^h7121] by my name[^h8034], to defile[^h2930] it.
###### 35
And they built[^h1129] the high places[^h1116] of Baal[^h1168], which are in the valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], to cause their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323] to pass[^h5674] through the fire unto Molech[^h4432]; which I commanded[^h6680] them not, neither came[^h5927] it into my mind[^h3820], that they should do[^h6213] this abomination[^h8441], to cause Judah[^h3063] to sin[^h2398].
###### 36
And now therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], concerning this city[^h5892], whereof ye say[^h559], It shall be delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] by the sword[^h2719], and by the famine[^h7458], and by the pestilence[^h1698];
###### 37
Behold, I will gather them out[^h6908] of all countries[^h776], whither I have driven[^h5080] them in mine anger[^h639], and in my fury[^h2534], and in great[^h1419] wrath[^h7110]; and I will bring them again[^h7725] unto this place[^h4725], and I will cause them to dwell[^h3427] safely[^h983]:
###### 38
And they shall be my people[^h5971], and I will be their God[^h430]:
###### 39
And I will give[^h5414] them one[^h259] heart[^h3820], and one[^h259] way[^h1870], that they may fear[^h3372] me for ever[^h3117], for the good[^h2896] of them, and of their children[^h1121] after[^h310] them: 
###### 40
And I will make[^h3772] an everlasting[^h5769] covenant[^h1285] with them, that I will not turn away[^h7725] from them[^h310], to do them good[^h3190]; but I will put[^h5414] my fear[^h3374] in their hearts[^h3824], that they shall not depart[^h5493] from me. 
###### 41
Yea, I will rejoice[^h7797] over them to do them good[^h2895], and I will plant[^h5193] them in this land[^h776] assuredly[^h571] with my whole heart[^h3820] and with my whole soul[^h5315]. 
###### 42
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Like as I have brought[^h935] all this great[^h1419] evil[^h7451] upon this people[^h5971], so will I bring[^h935] upon them all the good[^h2896] that I have promised[^h1696] them.
###### 43
And fields[^h7704] shall be bought[^h7069] in this land[^h776], whereof ye say[^h559], It is desolate[^h8077] without man[^h120] or beast[^h929]; it is given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778].
###### 44
Men shall buy[^h7069] fields[^h7704] for money[^h3701], and subscribe[^h3789] evidences[^h5612], and seal[^h2856] them, and take[^h5749] witnesses[^h5707] in the land[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144], and in the places about[^h5439] Jerusalem[^h3389], and in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and in the cities[^h5892] of the mountains[^h2022], and in the cities[^h5892] of the valley[^h8219], and in the cities[^h5892] of the south[^h5045]: for I will cause their captivity[^h7622] to return[^h7725], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].

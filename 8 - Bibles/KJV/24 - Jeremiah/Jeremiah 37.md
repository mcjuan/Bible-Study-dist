###### 1
And king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] reigned[^h4427] instead of Coniah[^h3659] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiakim[^h3079], whom Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] made king[^h4427] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 2
But neither he, nor his servants[^h5650], nor the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], did hearken[^h8085] unto the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he spake[^h1696] by[^h3027] the prophet[^h5030] Jeremiah[^h3414]. 
###### 3
And Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] Jehucal[^h3081] the son[^h1121] of Shelemiah[^h8018] and Zephaniah[^h6846] the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4641] the priest[^h3548] to the prophet[^h5030] Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559], Pray[^h6419] now unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] for us.
###### 4
Now Jeremiah[^h3414] came in[^h935] and went out[^h3318] among[^h8432] the people[^h5971]: for they had not put[^h5414] him into prison[^h1004] [^h3628].
###### 5
Then Pharaoh's[^h6547] army[^h2428] was come forth[^h3318] out of Egypt[^h4714]: and when the Chaldeans[^h3778] that besieged[^h6696] Jerusalem[^h3389] heard[^h8085] tidings[^h8088] of them, they departed[^h5927] from Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 6
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto the prophet[^h5030] Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 7
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Thus shall ye say[^h559] to the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], that sent[^h7971] you unto me to enquire[^h1875] of me; Behold, Pharaoh's[^h6547] army[^h2428], which is come forth[^h3318] to help[^h5833] you, shall return[^h7725] to Egypt[^h4714] into their own land[^h776].
###### 8
And the Chaldeans[^h3778] shall come again[^h7725], and fight[^h3898] against this city[^h5892], and take[^h3920] it, and burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784].
###### 9
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Deceive[^h5377] not yourselves[^h5315], saying[^h559], The Chaldeans[^h3778] shall surely[^h1980] depart[^h3212] from us: for they shall not depart[^h3212]. 
###### 10
For though ye had smitten[^h5221] the whole army[^h2428] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] that fight[^h3898] against you, and there remained[^h7604] but wounded[^h1856] men[^h582] among them, yet should they rise up[^h6965] every man[^h376] in his tent[^h168], and burn[^h8313] this city[^h5892] with fire[^h784]. 
###### 11
And it came to pass, that when the army[^h2428] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] was broken up[^h5927] from Jerusalem[^h3389] for fear[^h6440] of Pharaoh's[^h6547] army[^h2428], 
###### 12
Then Jeremiah[^h3414] went forth[^h3318] out of Jerusalem[^h3389] to go[^h3212] into the land[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144], to separate[^h2505] himself thence in the midst[^h8432] of the people[^h5971]. 
###### 13
And when he was in the gate[^h8179] of Benjamin[^h1144], a captain[^h1167] of the ward[^h6488] was there, whose name[^h8034] was Irijah[^h3376], the son[^h1121] of Shelemiah[^h8018], the son[^h1121] of Hananiah[^h2608]; and he took[^h8610] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030], saying[^h559], Thou fallest away[^h5307] to the Chaldeans[^h3778].
###### 14
Then said[^h559] Jeremiah[^h3414], It is false[^h8267]; I fall not away[^h5307] to the Chaldeans[^h3778]. But he hearkened[^h8085] not to him: so Irijah[^h3376] took[^h8610] Jeremiah[^h3414], and brought[^h935] him to the princes[^h8269]. 
###### 15
Wherefore the princes[^h8269] were wroth[^h7107] with Jeremiah[^h3414], and smote[^h5221] him, and put[^h5414] him in prison[^h612] in the house[^h1004] of Jonathan[^h3083] the scribe[^h5608]: for they had made[^h6213] that the prison[^h3608].
###### 16
When Jeremiah[^h3414] was entered[^h935] into the dungeon[^h1004] [^h953], and into the cabins[^h2588], and Jeremiah[^h3414] had remained[^h3427] there many[^h7227] days[^h3117]; 
###### 17
Then Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971], and took him out[^h3947]: and the king[^h4428] asked[^h7592] him secretly[^h5643] in his house[^h1004], and said[^h559], Is there any word[^h1697] from the LORD[^h3068]? And Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559], There is[^h3426]: for, said[^h559] he, thou shalt be delivered[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 18
Moreover Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] unto king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667], What have I offended[^h2398] against thee, or against thy servants[^h5650], or against this people[^h5971], that ye have put[^h5414] me in prison[^h1004] [^h3608]?
###### 19
Where are now[^h346] your prophets[^h5030] which prophesied[^h5012] unto you, saying[^h559], The king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] shall not come[^h935] against you, nor against this land[^h776]?
###### 20
Therefore hear[^h8085] now, I pray thee, O my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]: let my supplication[^h8467], I pray thee, be accepted[^h5307] before[^h6440] thee; that thou cause me not to return[^h7725] to the house[^h1004] of Jonathan[^h3083] the scribe[^h5608], lest I die[^h4191] there. 
###### 21
Then Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] that they should commit[^h6485] Jeremiah[^h3414] into the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307], and that they should give[^h5414] him daily[^h3117] a piece[^h3603] of bread[^h3899] out of the bakers'[^h644] street[^h2351], until all the bread[^h3899] in the city[^h5892] were spent[^h8552]. Thus Jeremiah[^h3414] remained[^h3427] in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307].

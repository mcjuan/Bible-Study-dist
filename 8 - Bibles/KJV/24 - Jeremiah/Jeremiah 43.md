###### 1
And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah[^h3414] had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] unto all the people[^h5971] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], for which the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430] had sent[^h7971] him to them, even all these words[^h1697],
###### 2
Then spake[^h559] Azariah[^h5838] the son[^h1121] of Hoshaiah[^h1955], and Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the proud[^h2086] men[^h582], saying[^h559] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], Thou speakest[^h1696] falsely[^h8267]: the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] hath not sent[^h7971] thee to say[^h559], Go[^h935] not into Egypt[^h4714] to sojourn[^h1481] there:
###### 3
But Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374] setteth thee on[^h5496] against us, for to[^h4616] deliver[^h5414] us into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], that they might put us to death[^h4191], and carry us away captives[^h1540] into Babylon[^h894].
###### 4
So Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428], and all the people[^h5971], obeyed[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], to dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 5
But Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428], took[^h3947] all the remnant[^h7611] of Judah[^h3063], that were returned[^h7725] from all nations[^h1471], whither they had been driven[^h5080], to dwell[^h1481] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063];
###### 6
Even men[^h1397], and women[^h802], and children[^h2945], and the king's[^h4428] daughters[^h1323], and every person[^h5315] that Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] had left[^h3240] with Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], and Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030], and Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374].
###### 7
So they came[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]: for they obeyed[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068]: thus came[^h935] they even to Tahpanhes[^h8471].
###### 8
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Jeremiah[^h3414] in Tahpanhes[^h8471], saying[^h559],
###### 9
Take[^h3947] great[^h1419] stones[^h68] in thine hand[^h3027], and hide[^h2934] them in the clay[^h4423] in the brickkiln[^h4404], which is at the entry[^h6607] of Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004] in Tahpanhes[^h8471], in the sight[^h5869] of the men[^h582] of Judah[^h3064];
###### 10
And say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will send[^h7971] and take[^h3947] Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], my servant[^h5650], and will set[^h7760] his throne[^h3678] upon[^h4605] these stones[^h68] that I have hid[^h2934]; and he shall spread[^h5186] his royal pavilion[^h8237] over them.
###### 11
And when he cometh[^h935], he shall smite[^h5221] the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], and deliver such as are for death[^h4194] to death[^h4194]; and such as are for captivity[^h7628] to captivity[^h7628]; and such as are for the sword[^h2719] to the sword[^h2719].
###### 12
And I will kindle[^h3341] a fire[^h784] in the houses[^h1004] of the gods[^h430] of Egypt[^h4714]; and he shall burn[^h8313] them, and carry them away captives[^h7617]: and he shall array[^h5844] himself with the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], as a shepherd[^h7462] putteth on[^h5844] his garment[^h899]; and he shall go forth[^h3318] from thence in peace[^h7965].
###### 13
He shall break[^h7665] also the images[^h4676] of Bethshemesh[^h1053], that is in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; and the houses[^h1004] of the gods[^h430] of the Egyptians[^h4714] shall he burn[^h8313] with fire[^h784].

###### 1
Righteous[^h6662] art thou, O LORD[^h3068], when I plead[^h7378] with thee: yet let me talk[^h1696] with thee of thy judgments[^h4941]: Wherefore doth the way[^h1870] of the wicked[^h7563] prosper[^h6743]? wherefore are all they happy[^h7951] that deal very[^h899] treacherously[^h898]? 
###### 2
Thou hast planted[^h5193] them, yea, they have taken root[^h8327]: they grow[^h3212], yea, they bring forth[^h6213] fruit[^h6529]: thou art near[^h7138] in their mouth[^h6310], and far from[^h7350] their reins[^h3629]. 
###### 3
But thou, O LORD[^h3068], knowest[^h3045] me: thou hast seen[^h7200] me, and tried[^h974] mine heart[^h3820] toward thee: pull them out[^h5423] like sheep[^h6629] for the slaughter[^h2878], and prepare[^h6942] them for the day[^h3117] of slaughter[^h2028]. 
###### 4
How long shall the land[^h776] mourn[^h56], and the herbs[^h6212] of every field[^h7704] wither[^h3001], for the wickedness[^h7451] of them that dwell[^h3427] therein? the beasts[^h929] are consumed[^h5595], and the birds[^h5775]; because they said[^h559], He shall not see[^h7200] our last end[^h319].
###### 5
If thou hast run[^h7323] with the footmen[^h7273], and they have wearied[^h3811] thee, then how canst thou contend[^h8474] with horses[^h5483]? and if in the land[^h776] of peace[^h7965], wherein thou trustedst[^h982], they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do[^h6213] in the swelling[^h1347] of Jordan[^h3383]?
###### 6
For even thy brethren[^h251], and the house[^h1004] of thy father[^h1], even they have dealt treacherously[^h898] with thee; yea, they have called[^h7121] a multitude[^h4392] after[^h310] thee: believe[^h539] them not, though they speak[^h1696] fair words[^h2896] unto thee.  
###### 7
I have forsaken[^h5800] mine house[^h1004], I have left[^h5203] mine heritage[^h5159]; I have given[^h5414] the dearly beloved[^h3033] of my soul[^h5315] into the hand[^h3709] of her enemies[^h341]. 
###### 8
Mine heritage[^h5159] is unto me as a lion[^h738] in the forest[^h3293]; it crieth out[^h5414] [^h6963] against me: therefore have I hated[^h8130] it. 
###### 9
Mine heritage[^h5159] is unto me as a speckled[^h6641] bird[^h5861], the birds[^h5861] round about[^h5439] are against her; come[^h3212] ye, assemble[^h622] all the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704], come[^h857] to devour[^h402].  
###### 10
Many[^h7227] pastors[^h7462] have destroyed[^h7843] my vineyard[^h3754], they have trodden[^h947] my portion[^h2513] under foot[^h947], they have made[^h5414] my pleasant[^h2532] portion[^h2513] a desolate[^h8077] wilderness[^h4057]. 
###### 11
They have made[^h7760] it desolate[^h8076], and being desolate[^h8077] it mourneth[^h56] unto me; the whole land[^h776] is made desolate[^h8074], because no man[^h376] layeth[^h7760] it to heart[^h3820].
###### 12
The spoilers[^h7703] are come[^h935] upon all high places[^h8205] through the wilderness[^h4057]: for the sword[^h2719] of the LORD[^h3068] shall devour[^h398] from the one end[^h7097] of the land[^h776] even to the other end[^h7097] of the land[^h776]: no flesh[^h1320] shall have peace[^h7965].
###### 13
They have sown[^h2232] wheat[^h2406], but shall reap[^h7114] thorns[^h6975]: they have put themselves to pain[^h2470], but shall not profit[^h3276]: and they shall be ashamed[^h954] of your revenues[^h8393] because of the fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 14
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] against all mine evil[^h7451] neighbours[^h7934], that touch[^h5060] the inheritance[^h5159] which I have caused my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] to inherit[^h5157]; Behold, I will pluck them out[^h5428] of their land[^h127], and pluck out[^h5428] the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] from among[^h8432] them.
###### 15
And it shall come to pass, after[^h310] that I have plucked them out[^h5428] I will return[^h7725], and have compassion[^h7355] on them, and will bring them again[^h7725], every man[^h376] to his heritage[^h5159], and every man[^h376] to his land[^h776].
###### 16
And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently[^h3925] learn[^h3925] the ways[^h1870] of my people[^h5971], to swear[^h7650] by my name[^h8034], The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416]; as they taught[^h3925] my people[^h5971] to swear[^h7650] by Baal[^h1168]; then shall they be built[^h1129] in the midst[^h8432] of my people[^h5971].
###### 17
But if they will not obey[^h8085], I will utterly[^h5428] pluck up[^h5428] and destroy[^h6] that nation[^h1471], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].

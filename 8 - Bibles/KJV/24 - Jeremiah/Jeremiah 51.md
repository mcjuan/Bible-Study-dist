###### 1
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will raise up[^h5782] against Babylon[^h894], and against them that dwell[^h3427] in the midst[^h3820] of them that rise up[^h6965] against me, a destroying[^h7843] wind[^h7307]; 
###### 2
And will send[^h7971] unto Babylon[^h894] fanners[^h2114], that shall fan[^h2219] her, and shall empty[^h1238] her land[^h776]: for in the day[^h3117] of trouble[^h7451] they shall be against her round about[^h5439].
###### 3
Against him that bendeth[^h1869] let the archer[^h1869] bend[^h1869] his bow[^h7198], and against him that lifteth himself up[^h5927] in his brigandine[^h5630]: and spare[^h2550] ye not her young men[^h970]; destroy ye utterly[^h2763] all her host[^h6635].
###### 4
Thus the slain[^h2491] shall fall[^h5307] in the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], and they that are thrust through[^h1856] in her streets[^h2351].
###### 5
For Israel[^h3478] hath not been forsaken[^h488], nor Judah[^h3063] of his God[^h430], of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; though their land[^h776] was filled[^h4390] with sin[^h817] against the Holy One[^h6918] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 6
Flee out[^h5127] of the midst[^h8432] of Babylon[^h894], and deliver[^h4422] every man[^h376] his soul[^h5315]: be not cut off[^h1826] in her iniquity[^h5771]; for this is the time[^h6256] of the LORD'S[^h3068] vengeance[^h5360]; he will render[^h7999] unto her a recompence[^h1576].
###### 7
Babylon[^h894] hath been a golden[^h2091] cup[^h3563] in the LORD'S[^h3068] hand[^h3027], that made all the earth[^h776] drunken[^h7937]: the nations[^h1471] have drunken[^h8354] of her wine[^h3196]; therefore the nations[^h1471] are mad[^h1984].
###### 8
Babylon[^h894] is suddenly[^h6597] fallen[^h5307] and destroyed[^h7665]: howl[^h3213] for her; take[^h3947] balm[^h6875] for her pain[^h4341], if so be she may be healed[^h7495].
###### 9
We would have healed[^h7495] Babylon[^h894], but she is not healed[^h7495]: forsake[^h5800] her, and let us go[^h3212] every one[^h376] into his own country[^h776]: for her judgment[^h4941] reacheth[^h5060] unto heaven[^h8064], and is lifted up[^h5375] even to the skies[^h7834].
###### 10
The LORD[^h3068] hath brought forth[^h3318] our righteousness[^h6666]: come[^h935], and let us declare[^h5608] in Zion[^h6726] the work[^h4639] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].
###### 11
Make bright[^h1305] the arrows[^h2671]; gather[^h4390] the shields[^h7982]: the LORD[^h3068] hath raised up[^h5782] the spirit[^h7307] of the kings[^h4428] of the Medes[^h4074]: for his device[^h4209] is against Babylon[^h894], to destroy[^h7843] it; because it is the vengeance[^h5360] of the LORD[^h3068], the vengeance[^h5360] of his temple[^h1964]. 
###### 12
Set up[^h5375] the standard[^h5251] upon the walls[^h2346] of Babylon[^h894], make the watch[^h4929] strong[^h2388], set up[^h6965] the watchmen[^h8104], prepare[^h3559] the ambushes[^h693]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath both devised[^h2161] and done[^h6213] that which he spake[^h1696] against the inhabitants[^h3427] of Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 13
O thou that dwellest[^h7931] [^h7931] upon many[^h7227] waters[^h4325], abundant[^h7227] in treasures[^h214], thine end[^h7093] is come[^h935], and the measure[^h520] of thy covetousness[^h1215].
###### 14
The LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] hath sworn[^h7650] by himself[^h5315], saying, Surely I will fill[^h4390] thee with men[^h120], as with caterpillers[^h3218]; and they shall lift up[^h6030] a shout[^h1959] against thee.  
###### 15
He hath made[^h6213] the earth[^h776] by his power[^h3581], he hath established[^h3559] the world[^h8398] by his wisdom[^h2451], and hath stretched out[^h5186] the heaven[^h8064] by his understanding[^h8394].
###### 16
When he uttereth[^h5414] his voice[^h6963], there is a multitude[^h1995] of waters[^h4325] in the heavens[^h8064]; and he causeth the vapours[^h5387] to ascend[^h5927] from the ends[^h7097] of the earth[^h776]: he maketh[^h6213] lightnings[^h1300] with rain[^h4306], and bringeth forth[^h3318] the wind[^h7307] out of his treasures[^h214]. 
###### 17
Every man[^h120] is brutish[^h1197] by his knowledge[^h1847]; every founder[^h6884] is confounded[^h3001] by the graven image[^h6459]: for his molten image[^h5262] is falsehood[^h8267], and there is no breath[^h7307] in them. 
###### 18
They are vanity[^h1892], the work[^h4639] of errors[^h8595]: in the time[^h6256] of their visitation[^h6486] they shall perish[^h6].
###### 19
The portion[^h2506] of Jacob[^h3290] is not like them; for he is the former[^h3335] of all things: and Israel is the rod[^h7626] of his inheritance[^h5159]: the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is his name[^h8034].
###### 20
Thou art my battle axe[^h4661] and weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421]: for with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] the nations[^h1471], and with thee will I destroy[^h7843] kingdoms[^h4467]; 
###### 21
And with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] the horse[^h5483] and his rider[^h7392]; and with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] the chariot[^h7393] and his rider[^h7392];
###### 22
With thee also will I break in pieces[^h5310] man[^h376] and woman[^h802]; and with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] old[^h2205] and young[^h5288]; and with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] the young man[^h970] and the maid[^h1330];
###### 23
I will also break in pieces[^h5310] with thee the shepherd[^h7462] and his flock[^h5739]; and with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] the husbandman[^h406] and his yoke of oxen[^h6776]; and with thee will I break in pieces[^h5310] captains[^h6346] and rulers[^h5461].
###### 24
And I will render[^h7999] unto Babylon[^h894] and to all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Chaldea[^h3778] all their evil[^h7451] that they have done[^h6213] in Zion[^h6726] in your sight[^h5869], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
Behold, I am against thee, O destroying[^h4889] mountain[^h2022], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], which destroyest[^h7843] all the earth[^h776]: and I will stretch out[^h5186] mine hand[^h3027] upon thee, and roll thee down[^h1556] from the rocks[^h5553], and will make[^h5414] thee a burnt[^h8316] mountain[^h2022].
###### 26
And they shall not take[^h3947] of thee a stone[^h68] for a corner[^h6438], nor a stone[^h68] for foundations[^h4146]; but thou shalt be desolate[^h8077] for ever[^h5769], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 27
Set ye up[^h5375] a standard[^h5251] in the land[^h776], blow[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782] among the nations[^h1471], prepare[^h6942] the nations[^h1471] against her, call together[^h8085] against her the kingdoms[^h4467] of Ararat[^h780], Minni[^h4508], and Ashchenaz[^h813]; appoint[^h6485] a captain[^h2951] against her; cause the horses[^h5483] to come up[^h5927] as the rough[^h5569] caterpillers[^h3218].
###### 28
Prepare[^h6942] against her the nations[^h1471] with the kings[^h4428] of the Medes[^h4074], the captains[^h6346] thereof, and all the rulers[^h5461] thereof, and all the land[^h776] of his dominion[^h4475].
###### 29
And the land[^h776] shall tremble[^h7493] and sorrow[^h2342]: for every purpose[^h4284] of the LORD[^h3068] shall be performed[^h6965] against Babylon[^h894], to make[^h7760] the land[^h776] of Babylon[^h894] a desolation[^h8047] without an inhabitant[^h3427].
###### 30
The mighty men[^h1368] of Babylon[^h894] have forborn[^h2308] to fight[^h3898], they have remained[^h3427] in their holds[^h4679]: their might[^h1369] hath failed[^h5405]; they became as women[^h802]: they have burned[^h3341] her dwellingplaces[^h4908]; her bars[^h1280] are broken[^h7665].
###### 31
One post[^h7323] shall run[^h7323] to meet[^h7125] another[^h7323], and one messenger[^h5046] to meet[^h7125] another[^h5046], to shew[^h5046] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] that his city[^h5892] is taken[^h3920] at one end[^h7097],
###### 32
And that the passages[^h4569] are stopped[^h8610], and the reeds[^h98] they have burned[^h8313] with fire[^h784], and the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] are affrighted[^h926].
###### 33
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; The daughter[^h1323] of Babylon[^h894] is like a threshingfloor[^h1637], it is time[^h6256] to thresh[^h1869] her: yet a little while[^h4592], and the time[^h6256] of her harvest[^h7105] shall come[^h935]. 
###### 34
Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] hath devoured[^h398] me, he hath crushed[^h2000] me, he hath made[^h3322] me an empty[^h7385] vessel[^h3627], he hath swallowed me up[^h1104] like a dragon[^h8577], he hath filled[^h4390] his belly[^h3770] with my delicates[^h5730], he hath cast me out[^h1740].
###### 35
The violence[^h2555] done to me and to my flesh[^h7607] be upon Babylon[^h894], shall the inhabitant[^h3427] of Zion[^h6726] say[^h559]; and my blood[^h1818] upon the inhabitants[^h3427] of Chaldea[^h3778], shall Jerusalem[^h3389] say[^h559].   
###### 36
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will plead[^h7378] thy cause[^h7379], and take vengeance[^h5358] for thee[^h5360]; and I will dry up[^h2717] her sea[^h3220], and make her springs[^h4726] dry[^h3001].
###### 37
And Babylon[^h894] shall become heaps[^h1530], a dwellingplace[^h4583] for dragons[^h8577], an astonishment[^h8047], and an hissing[^h8322], without an inhabitant[^h3427].
###### 38
They shall roar[^h7580] together[^h3162] like lions[^h3715]: they shall yell[^h5286] as lions'[^h738] whelps[^h1484]. 
###### 39
In their heat[^h2527] I will make[^h7896] their feasts[^h4960], and I will make them drunken[^h7937], that they may rejoice[^h5937], and sleep[^h3462] a perpetual[^h5769] sleep[^h8142], and not wake[^h6974], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 40
I will bring them down[^h3381] like lambs[^h3733] to the slaughter[^h2873], like rams[^h352] with he goats[^h6260].
###### 41
How is Sheshach[^h8347] taken[^h3920]! and how is the praise[^h8416] of the whole earth[^h776] surprised[^h8610]! how is Babylon[^h894] become an astonishment[^h8047] among the nations[^h1471]!
###### 42
The sea[^h3220] is come up[^h5927] upon Babylon[^h894]: she is covered[^h3680] with the multitude[^h1995] of the waves[^h1530] thereof.
###### 43
Her cities[^h5892] are a desolation[^h8047], a dry[^h6723] land[^h776], and a wilderness[^h6160], a land[^h776] wherein no man[^h376] dwelleth[^h3427], neither doth any son[^h1121] of man[^h120] pass[^h5674] thereby[^h2004].
###### 44
And I will punish[^h6485] Bel[^h1078] in Babylon[^h894], and I will bring forth[^h3318] out of his mouth[^h6310] that which he hath swallowed up[^h1105]: and the nations[^h1471] shall not flow together[^h5102] any more unto him: yea, the wall[^h2346] of Babylon[^h894] shall fall[^h5307].
###### 45
My people[^h5971], go ye out[^h3318] of the midst[^h8432] of her, and deliver[^h4422] ye every man[^h376] his soul[^h5315] from the fierce[^h2740] anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 46
And lest your heart[^h3824] faint[^h7401], and ye fear[^h3372] for the rumour[^h8052] that shall be heard[^h8085] in the land[^h776]; a rumour[^h8052] shall both come[^h935] one year[^h8141], and after[^h310] that in another year[^h8141] shall come a rumour[^h8052], and violence[^h2555] in the land[^h776], ruler[^h4910] against ruler[^h4910]. 
###### 47
Therefore, behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], that I will do judgment[^h6485] upon the graven images[^h6456] of Babylon[^h894]: and her whole land[^h776] shall be confounded[^h954], and all her slain[^h2491] shall fall[^h5307] in the midst[^h8432] of her. 
###### 48
Then the heaven[^h8064] and the earth[^h776], and all that is therein, shall sing[^h7442] for Babylon[^h894]: for the spoilers[^h7703] shall come[^h935] unto her from the north[^h6828], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 49
As[^h1571] Babylon[^h894] hath caused the slain[^h2491] of Israel[^h3478] to fall[^h5307], so at Babylon[^h894] shall fall[^h5307] the slain[^h2491] of all the earth[^h776].  
###### 50
Ye that have escaped[^h6405] the sword[^h2719], go away[^h1980], stand not still[^h5975]: remember[^h2142] the LORD[^h3068] afar off[^h7350], and let Jerusalem[^h3389] come[^h5927] into your mind[^h3824].
###### 51
We are confounded[^h954], because we have heard[^h8085] reproach[^h2781]: shame[^h3639] hath covered[^h3680] our faces[^h6440]: for strangers[^h2114] are come[^h935] into the sanctuaries[^h4720] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004].
###### 52
Wherefore, behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that I will do judgment[^h6485] upon her graven images[^h6456]: and through all her land[^h776] the wounded[^h2491] shall groan[^h602].
###### 53
Though Babylon[^h894] should mount up[^h5927] to heaven[^h8064], and though she should fortify[^h1219] the height[^h4791] of her strength[^h5797], yet [^h227] from me shall spoilers[^h7703] come[^h935] unto her, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 54
A sound[^h6963] of a cry[^h2201] cometh from Babylon[^h894], and great[^h1419] destruction[^h7667] from the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]:
###### 55
Because the LORD[^h3068] hath spoiled[^h7703] Babylon[^h894], and destroyed[^h6] out of her the great[^h1419] voice[^h6963]; when her waves[^h1530] do roar[^h1993] like great[^h7227] waters[^h4325], a noise[^h7588] of their voice[^h6963] is uttered[^h5414]:
###### 56
Because the spoiler[^h7703] is come[^h935] upon her, even upon Babylon[^h894], and her mighty men[^h1368] are taken[^h3920], every one of their bows[^h7198] is broken[^h2865]: for the LORD[^h3068] God[^h410] of recompences[^h1578] shall surely[^h7999] requite[^h7999].
###### 57
And I will make drunk[^h7937] her princes[^h8269], and her wise[^h2450] men, her captains[^h6346], and her rulers[^h5461], and her mighty men[^h1368]: and they shall sleep[^h3462] a perpetual[^h5769] sleep[^h8142], and not wake[^h6974], saith[^h5002] the King[^h4428], whose name[^h8034] is the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 58
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; The broad[^h7342] walls[^h2346] of Babylon[^h894] shall be utterly[^h6209] broken[^h6209], and her high[^h1364] gates[^h8179] shall be burned[^h3341] with fire[^h784]; and the people[^h5971] shall labour[^h3021] in vain[^h7385], and the folk[^h3816] in[^h1767] the fire[^h784], and they shall be weary[^h3286].  
###### 59
The word[^h1697] which Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] commanded[^h6680] Seraiah[^h8304] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374], the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4271], when he went[^h3212] with Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] into Babylon[^h894] in the fourth[^h7243] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427]. And this Seraiah[^h8304] was a quiet[^h4496] prince[^h8269].  
###### 60
So Jeremiah[^h3414] wrote[^h3789] in a[^h259] book[^h5612] all the evil[^h7451] that should come[^h935] upon Babylon[^h894], even all these words[^h1697] that are written[^h3789] against Babylon[^h894].
###### 61
And Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] to Seraiah[^h8304], When thou comest[^h935] to Babylon[^h894], and shalt see[^h7200], and shalt read[^h7121] all these words[^h1697];
###### 62
Then shalt thou say[^h559], O LORD[^h3068], thou hast spoken[^h1696] against this place[^h4725], to cut it off[^h3772], that none shall remain[^h3427] in it, neither man[^h120] nor beast[^h929], but that it shall be desolate[^h8077] for ever[^h5769]. 
###### 63
And it shall be, when thou hast made an end[^h3615] of reading[^h7121] this book[^h5612], that thou shalt bind[^h7194] a stone[^h68] to it, and cast[^h7993] it into the midst[^h8432] of Euphrates[^h6578]:
###### 64
And thou shalt say[^h559], Thus shall Babylon[^h894] sink[^h8257], and shall not rise[^h6965] from[^h6440] the evil[^h7451] that I will bring[^h935] upon her: and they shall be weary[^h3286]. Thus far are the words[^h1697] of Jeremiah[^h3414].

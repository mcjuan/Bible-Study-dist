###### 1
Now Pashur[^h6583] the son[^h1121] of Immer[^h564] the priest[^h3548], who was also chief[^h6496] governor[^h5057] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], heard[^h8085] that Jeremiah[^h3414] prophesied[^h5012] these things[^h1697].
###### 2
Then Pashur[^h6583] smote[^h5221] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030], and put[^h5414] him in the stocks[^h4115] that were in the high[^h5945] gate[^h8179] of Benjamin[^h1144], which was by the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that Pashur[^h6583] brought forth[^h3318] Jeremiah[^h3414] out of the stocks[^h4115]. Then said[^h559] Jeremiah[^h3414] unto him, The LORD[^h3068] hath not called[^h7121] thy name[^h8034] Pashur[^h6583], but Magormissabib[^h4036]. 
###### 4
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will make[^h5414] thee a terror[^h4032] to thyself, and to all thy friends[^h157]: and they shall fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719] of their enemies[^h341], and thine eyes[^h5869] shall behold[^h7200] it: and I will give[^h5414] all Judah[^h3063] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall carry them captive[^h1540] into Babylon[^h894], and shall slay[^h5221] them with the sword[^h2719].
###### 5
Moreover I will deliver[^h5414] all the strength[^h2633] of this city[^h5892], and all the labours[^h3018] thereof, and all the precious things[^h3366] thereof, and all the treasures[^h214] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] will I give[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341], which shall spoil[^h962] them, and take[^h3947] them, and carry[^h935] them to Babylon[^h894].
###### 6
And thou, Pashur[^h6583], and all that dwell[^h3427] in thine house[^h1004] shall go[^h3212] into captivity[^h7628]: and thou shalt come[^h935] to Babylon[^h894], and there thou shalt die[^h4191], and shalt be buried[^h6912] there, thou, and all thy friends[^h157], to whom thou hast prophesied[^h5012] lies[^h8267].
###### 7
O LORD[^h3068], thou hast deceived[^h6601] me, and I was deceived[^h6601]: thou art stronger[^h2388] than I, and hast prevailed[^h3201]: I am in derision[^h7814] daily[^h3117], every one mocketh[^h3932] me. 
###### 8
For since[^h1767] I spake[^h1696], I cried out[^h2199], I cried[^h7121] violence[^h2555] and spoil[^h7701]; because the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] was made a reproach[^h2781] unto me, and a derision[^h7047], daily[^h3117].
###### 9
Then I said[^h559], I will not make mention[^h2142] of him, nor speak[^h1696] any more in his name[^h8034]. But his word was in mine heart[^h3820] as a burning[^h1197] fire[^h784] shut up[^h6113] in my bones[^h6106], and I was weary[^h3811] with forbearing[^h3557], and I could[^h3201] not stay.
###### 10
For I heard[^h8085] the defaming[^h1681] of many[^h7227], fear[^h4032] on every side[^h5439]. Report[^h5046], say they, and we will report[^h5046] it. All my familiars[^h582] [^h7965] watched[^h8104] for my halting[^h6763] [^h6761], saying, Peradventure he will be enticed[^h6601], and we shall prevail[^h3201] against him, and we shall take[^h3947] our revenge[^h5360] on him. 
###### 11
But the LORD[^h3068] is with me as a mighty[^h1368] terrible one[^h6184]: therefore my persecutors[^h7291] shall stumble[^h3782], and they shall not prevail[^h3201]: they shall be greatly[^h3966] ashamed[^h954]; for they shall not prosper[^h7919]: their everlasting[^h5769] confusion[^h3639] shall never be forgotten[^h7911].
###### 12
But, O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], that triest[^h974] the righteous[^h6662], and seest[^h7200] the reins[^h3629] and the heart[^h3820], let me see[^h7200] thy vengeance[^h5360] on them: for unto thee have I opened[^h1540] my cause[^h7379].
###### 13
Sing[^h7891] unto the LORD[^h3068], praise[^h1984] ye the LORD[^h3068]: for he hath delivered[^h5337] the soul[^h5315] of the poor[^h34] from the hand[^h3027] of evildoers[^h7489].
###### 14
Cursed[^h779] be the day[^h3117] wherein I was born[^h3205]: let not the day[^h3117] wherein my mother[^h517] bare[^h3205] me be blessed[^h1288].
###### 15
Cursed[^h779] be the man[^h376] who brought tidings[^h1319] to my father[^h1], saying[^h559], A man[^h2145] child[^h1121] is born[^h3205] unto thee; making him very[^h8055] glad[^h8055].
###### 16
And let that man[^h376] be as the cities[^h5892] which the LORD[^h3068] overthrew[^h2015], and repented[^h5162] not: and let him hear[^h8085] the cry[^h2201] in the morning[^h1242], and the shouting[^h8643] at noontide[^h6256] [^h6672];
###### 17
Because he slew[^h4191] me not from the womb[^h7358]; or that my mother[^h517] might have been my grave[^h6913], and her womb[^h7358] to be always[^h5769] great[^h2030] with me.
###### 18
Wherefore came I forth[^h3318] out of the womb[^h7358] to see[^h7200] labour[^h5999] and sorrow[^h3015], that my days[^h3117] should be consumed[^h3615] with shame[^h1322]?

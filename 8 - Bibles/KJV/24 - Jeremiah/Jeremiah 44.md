###### 1
The word[^h1697] that came to Jeremiah[^h3414] concerning all the Jews[^h3064] which dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], which dwell[^h3427] at Migdol[^h4024], and at Tahpanhes[^h8471], and at Noph[^h5297], and in the country[^h776] of Pathros[^h6624], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Ye have seen[^h7200] all the evil[^h7451] that I have brought[^h935] upon Jerusalem[^h3389], and upon all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063]; and, behold, this day[^h3117] they are a desolation[^h2723], and no man dwelleth[^h3427] therein,
###### 3
Because[^h6440] of their wickedness[^h7451] which they have committed[^h6213] to provoke me to anger[^h3707], in that they went[^h3212] to burn incense[^h6999], and to serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], whom they knew[^h3045] not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers[^h1].
###### 4
Howbeit I sent[^h7971] unto you all my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], rising early[^h7925] and sending[^h7971] them, saying[^h559], Oh, do[^h6213] not this abominable[^h8441] thing[^h1697] that I hate[^h8130].
###### 5
But they hearkened[^h8085] not, nor inclined[^h5186] their ear[^h241] to turn[^h7725] from their wickedness[^h7451], to burn no incense[^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 6
Wherefore my fury[^h2534] and mine anger[^h639] was poured forth[^h5413], and was kindled[^h1197] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] and in the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389]; and they are wasted[^h2723] and desolate[^h8077], as at this day[^h3117].
###### 7
Therefore now thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Wherefore commit[^h6213] ye this great[^h1419] evil[^h7451] against your souls[^h5315], to cut off[^h3772] from you man[^h376] and woman[^h802], child[^h5768] and suckling[^h3243], out[^h8432] of Judah[^h3063], to leave[^h3498] you none to remain[^h7611]; 
###### 8
In that ye provoke me unto wrath[^h3707] with the works[^h4639] of your hands[^h3027], burning incense[^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], whither ye be gone[^h935] to dwell[^h1481], that ye might cut yourselves off[^h3772], and that ye might be a curse[^h7045] and a reproach[^h2781] among all the nations[^h1471] of the earth[^h776]?
###### 9
Have ye forgotten[^h7911] the wickedness[^h7451] of your fathers[^h1], and the wickedness[^h7451] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and the wickedness[^h7451] of their wives[^h802], and your own wickedness[^h7451], and the wickedness[^h7451] of your wives[^h802], which they have committed[^h6213] in the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], and in the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389]? 
###### 10
They are not humbled[^h1792] even unto this day[^h3117], neither have they feared[^h3372], nor walked[^h1980] in my law[^h8451], nor in my statutes[^h2708], that I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you and before[^h6440] your fathers[^h1]. 
###### 11
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will set[^h7760] my face[^h6440] against you for evil[^h7451], and to cut off[^h3772] all Judah[^h3063].
###### 12
And I will take[^h3947] the remnant[^h7611] of Judah[^h3063], that have set[^h7760] their faces[^h6440] to go[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] to sojourn[^h1481] there, and they shall all be consumed[^h8552], and fall[^h5307] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; they shall even be consumed[^h8552] by the sword[^h2719] and by the famine[^h7458]: they shall die[^h4191], from the least[^h6996] even unto the greatest[^h1419], by the sword[^h2719] and by the famine[^h7458]: and they shall be an execration[^h423], and an astonishment[^h8047], and a curse[^h7045], and a reproach[^h2781].
###### 13
For I will punish[^h6485] them that dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], as I have punished[^h6485] Jerusalem[^h3389], by the sword[^h2719], by the famine[^h7458], and by the pestilence[^h1698]:
###### 14
So that none of the remnant[^h7611] of Judah[^h3063], which are gone[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] to sojourn[^h1481] there, shall escape[^h6412] or remain[^h8300], that they should return[^h7725] into the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], to the which they have[^h5375] a desire[^h5315] to return[^h7725] to dwell[^h3427] there: for none shall return[^h7725] but such as shall escape[^h6405]. 
###### 15
Then all the men[^h582] which knew[^h3045] that their wives[^h802] had burned incense[^h6999] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], and all the women[^h802] that stood by[^h5975], a great[^h1419] multitude[^h6951], even all the people[^h5971] that dwelt[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], in Pathros[^h6624], answered[^h6030] Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 16
As for the word[^h1697] that thou hast spoken[^h1696] unto us in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], we will not hearken[^h8085] unto thee.
###### 17
But we will certainly[^h6213] do[^h6213] whatsoever thing[^h1697] goeth forth[^h3318] out of our own mouth[^h6310], to burn incense[^h6999] unto the queen[^h4446] of heaven[^h8064], and to pour out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto her, as we have done[^h6213], we, and our fathers[^h1], our kings[^h4428], and our princes[^h8269], in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and in the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389]: for then had we plenty[^h7646] of victuals[^h3899], and were well[^h2896], and saw[^h7200] no evil[^h7451].  
###### 18
But since we left off[^h2308] to burn incense[^h6999] to the queen[^h4446] of heaven[^h8064], and to pour out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto her, we have wanted[^h2637] all things, and have been consumed[^h8552] by the sword[^h2719] and by the famine[^h7458].
###### 19
And when we burned incense[^h6999] to the queen[^h4446] of heaven[^h8064], and poured out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto her, did we make[^h6213] her cakes[^h3561] to worship[^h6087] her, and pour out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto her, without[^h1107] our men[^h582]? 
###### 20
Then Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], to the men[^h1397], and to the women[^h802], and to all the people[^h5971] which had given him that answer[^h1697] [^h6030], saying[^h559],
###### 21
The incense[^h7002] that ye burned[^h6999] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and in the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389], ye, and your fathers[^h1], your kings[^h4428], and your princes[^h8269], and the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], did not the LORD[^h3068] remember[^h2142] them, and came[^h5927] it not into his mind[^h3820]?
###### 22
So that the LORD[^h3068] could[^h3201] no longer bear[^h5375], because[^h6440] of the evil[^h7455] of your doings[^h4611], and because[^h6440] of the abominations[^h8441] which ye have committed[^h6213]; therefore is your land[^h776] a desolation[^h2723], and an astonishment[^h8047], and a curse[^h7045], without an inhabitant[^h3427], as at this day[^h3117].
###### 23
Because[^h6440] [^h834] ye have burned incense[^h6999], and because ye have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], and have not obeyed[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], nor walked[^h1980] in his law[^h8451], nor in his statutes[^h2708], nor in his testimonies[^h5715]; therefore this evil[^h7451] is happened[^h7122] unto you, as at this day[^h3117].
###### 24
Moreover Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] unto all the people[^h5971], and to all the women[^h802], Hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], all Judah[^h3063] that are in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 25
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559]; Ye and your wives[^h802] have both spoken[^h1696] with your mouths[^h6310], and fulfilled[^h4390] with your hand[^h3027], saying[^h559], We will surely[^h6213] perform[^h6213] our vows[^h5088] that we have vowed[^h5087], to burn incense[^h6999] to the queen[^h4446] of heaven[^h8064], and to pour out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto her: ye will surely[^h6965] accomplish[^h6965] your vows[^h5088], and surely[^h6213] perform[^h6213] your vows[^h5088].
###### 26
Therefore hear[^h8085] ye the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], all Judah[^h3063] that dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]; Behold, I have sworn[^h7650] by my great[^h1419] name[^h8034], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], that my name[^h8034] shall no more be named[^h7121] in the mouth[^h6310] of any man[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] in all the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], saying[^h559], The Lord[^h136] GOD[^h3069] liveth[^h2416].
###### 27
Behold, I will watch[^h8245] over them for evil[^h7451], and not for good[^h2896]: and all the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] that are in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] shall be consumed[^h8552] by the sword[^h2719] and by the famine[^h7458], until there be an end[^h3615] of them.
###### 28
Yet a small[^h4962] number[^h4557] that escape[^h6412] the sword[^h2719] shall return out[^h7725] of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] into the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], and all the remnant[^h7611] of Judah[^h3063], that are gone[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] to sojourn[^h1481] there, shall know[^h3045] whose words[^h1697] shall stand[^h6965], mine, or theirs. 
###### 29
And this shall be a sign[^h226] unto you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that I will punish[^h6485] you in this place[^h4725], that ye may know[^h3045] that my words[^h1697] shall surely[^h6965] stand[^h6965] against you for evil[^h7451]:
###### 30
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will give[^h5414] Pharaohhophra[^h6548] king[^h4428] of Egypt[^h4714] into the hand[^h3027] of his enemies[^h341], and into the hand[^h3027] of them that seek[^h1245] his life[^h5315]; as I gave[^h5414] Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] into the hand[^h3027] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], his enemy[^h341], and that sought[^h1245] his life[^h5315].

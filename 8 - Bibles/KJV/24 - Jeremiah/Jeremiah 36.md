###### 1
And it came to pass in the fourth[^h7243] year[^h8141] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], that this word[^h1697] came unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Take[^h3947] thee a roll[^h4039] of a book[^h5612], and write[^h3789] therein all the words[^h1697] that I have spoken[^h1696] unto thee against Israel[^h3478], and against Judah[^h3063], and against all the nations[^h1471], from the day[^h3117] I spake[^h1696] unto thee, from the days[^h3117] of Josiah[^h2977], even unto this day[^h3117].
###### 3
It may be that the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] will hear[^h8085] all the evil[^h7451] which I purpose[^h2803] to do[^h6213] unto them; that they may return[^h7725] every man[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870]; that I may forgive[^h5545] their iniquity[^h5771] and their sin[^h2403].
###### 4
Then Jeremiah[^h3414] called[^h7121] Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374]: and Baruch[^h1263] wrote[^h3789] from the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], which he had spoken[^h1696] unto him, upon a roll[^h4039] of a book[^h5612].
###### 5
And Jeremiah[^h3414] commanded[^h6680] Baruch[^h1263], saying[^h559], I am shut up[^h6113]; I cannot[^h3201] go[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]:
###### 6
Therefore go[^h935] thou, and read[^h7121] in the roll[^h4039], which thou hast written[^h3789] from my mouth[^h6310], the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971] in the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004] upon the fasting[^h6685] day[^h3117]: and also thou shalt read[^h7121] them in the ears[^h241] of all Judah[^h3063] that come out[^h935] of their cities[^h5892].
###### 7
It may be they will present[^h5307] their supplication[^h8467] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and will return[^h7725] every one[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870]: for great[^h1419] is the anger[^h639] and the fury[^h2534] that the LORD[^h3068] hath pronounced[^h1696] against this people[^h5971]. 
###### 8
And Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374] did[^h6213] according to all that Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] commanded[^h6680] him, reading[^h7121] in the book[^h5612] the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] in the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004].
###### 9
And it came to pass in the fifth[^h2549] year[^h8141] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], in the ninth[^h8671] month[^h2320], that they proclaimed[^h7121] a fast[^h6685] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] to all the people[^h5971] in Jerusalem[^h3389], and to all the people[^h5971] that came[^h935] from the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] unto Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 10
Then read[^h7121] Baruch[^h1263] in the book[^h5612] the words[^h1697] of Jeremiah[^h3414] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], in the chamber[^h3957] of Gemariah[^h1587] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227] the scribe[^h5608], in the higher[^h5945] court[^h2691], at the entry[^h6607] of the new[^h2319] gate[^h8179] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004], in the ears[^h241] of all the people[^h5971]. 
###### 11
When Michaiah[^h4321] the son[^h1121] of Gemariah[^h1587], the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], had heard[^h8085] out of the book[^h5612] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068],
###### 12
Then he went down[^h3381] into the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], into the scribe's[^h5608] chamber[^h3957]: and, lo, all the princes[^h8269] sat[^h3427] there, even Elishama[^h476] the scribe[^h5608], and Delaiah[^h1806] the son[^h1121] of Shemaiah[^h8098], and Elnathan[^h494] the son[^h1121] of Achbor[^h5907], and Gemariah[^h1587] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], and Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Hananiah[^h2608], and all the princes[^h8269].
###### 13
Then Michaiah[^h4321] declared[^h5046] unto them all the words[^h1697] that he had heard[^h8085], when Baruch[^h1263] read[^h7121] the book[^h5612] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971].
###### 14
Therefore all the princes[^h8269] sent[^h7971] Jehudi[^h3065] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], the son[^h1121] of Shelemiah[^h8018], the son[^h1121] of Cushi[^h3570], unto Baruch[^h1263], saying[^h559], Take[^h3947] in thine hand[^h3027] the roll[^h4039] wherein thou hast read[^h7121] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971], and come[^h3212]. So Baruch[^h1263] the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374] took[^h3947] the roll[^h4039] in his hand[^h3027], and came[^h935] unto them.
###### 15
And they said[^h559] unto him, Sit down[^h3427] now, and read[^h7121] it in our ears[^h241]. So Baruch[^h1263] read[^h7121] it in their ears[^h241].
###### 16
Now it came to pass, when they had heard[^h8085] all the words[^h1697], they were afraid[^h6342] both[^h413] one[^h376] and other[^h7453], and said[^h559] unto Baruch[^h1263], We will surely[^h5046] tell[^h5046] the king[^h4428] of all these words[^h1697].
###### 17
And they asked[^h7592] Baruch[^h1263], saying[^h559], Tell[^h5046] us now, How didst thou write[^h3789] all these words[^h1697] at his mouth[^h6310]?
###### 18
Then Baruch[^h1263] answered[^h559] them, He pronounced[^h7121] all these words[^h1697] unto me with his mouth[^h6310], and I wrote[^h3789] them with ink[^h1773] in the book[^h5612].
###### 19
Then said[^h559] the princes[^h8269] unto Baruch[^h1263], Go[^h3212], hide[^h5641] thee, thou and Jeremiah[^h3414]; and let no man[^h376] know[^h3045] where[^h375] ye be.
###### 20
And they went in[^h935] to the king[^h4428] into the court[^h2691], but they laid up[^h6485] the roll[^h4039] in the chamber[^h3957] of Elishama[^h476] the scribe[^h5608], and told[^h5046] all the words[^h1697] in the ears[^h241] of the king[^h4428].
###### 21
So the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] Jehudi[^h3065] to fetch[^h3947] the roll[^h4039]: and he took[^h3947] it out of Elishama[^h476] the scribe's[^h5608] chamber[^h3957]. And Jehudi[^h3065] read[^h7121] it in the ears[^h241] of the king[^h4428], and in the ears[^h241] of all the princes[^h8269] which stood[^h5975] beside[^h5921] the king[^h4428].
###### 22
Now the king[^h4428] sat[^h3427] in the winterhouse[^h1004] [^h2779] in the ninth[^h8671] month[^h2320]: and there was a fire on the hearth[^h254] burning[^h1197] before[^h6440] him.
###### 23
And it came to pass, that when Jehudi[^h3065] had read[^h7121] three[^h7969] or four[^h702] leaves[^h1817], he cut[^h7167] it with the penknife[^h8593] [^h5608], and cast[^h7993] it into the fire[^h784] that was on the hearth[^h254], until all the roll[^h4039] was consumed[^h8552] in the fire[^h784] that was on the hearth[^h254].
###### 24
Yet they were not afraid[^h6342], nor rent[^h7167] their garments[^h899], neither the king[^h4428], nor any of his servants[^h5650] that heard[^h8085] all these words[^h1697].
###### 25
Nevertheless Elnathan[^h494] and Delaiah[^h1806] and Gemariah[^h1587] had made intercession[^h6293] to the king[^h4428] that he would not burn[^h8313] the roll[^h4039]: but he would not hear[^h8085] them.
###### 26
But the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Jerahmeel[^h3396] the son[^h1121] of Hammelech[^h4429], and Seraiah[^h8304] the son[^h1121] of Azriel[^h5837], and Shelemiah[^h8018] the son[^h1121] of Abdeel[^h5655], to take[^h3947] Baruch[^h1263] the scribe[^h5608] and Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030]: but the LORD[^h3068] hid[^h5641] them. 
###### 27
Then the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Jeremiah[^h3414], after[^h310] that the king[^h4428] had burned[^h8313] the roll[^h4039], and the words[^h1697] which Baruch[^h1263] wrote[^h3789] at the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 28
Take[^h3947] thee again[^h7725] another[^h312] roll[^h4039], and write[^h3789] in it all the former[^h7223] words[^h1697] that were in the first[^h7223] roll[^h4039], which Jehoiakim[^h3079] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] hath burned[^h8313].
###### 29
And thou shalt say[^h559] to Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Thou hast burned[^h8313] this roll[^h4039], saying[^h559], Why hast thou written[^h3789] therein, saying[^h559], The king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] shall certainly[^h935] come[^h935] and destroy[^h7843] this land[^h776], and shall cause to cease[^h7673] from thence man[^h120] and beast[^h929]?
###### 30
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]; He shall have none to sit[^h3427] upon the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732]: and his dead body[^h5038] shall be cast out[^h7993] in the day[^h3117] to the heat[^h2721], and in the night[^h3915] to the frost[^h7140].
###### 31
And I will punish[^h6485] him and his seed[^h2233] and his servants[^h5650] for their iniquity[^h5771]; and I will bring[^h935] upon them, and upon the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and upon the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], all the evil[^h7451] that I have pronounced[^h1696] against them; but they hearkened[^h8085] not. 
###### 32
Then took[^h3947] Jeremiah[^h3414] another[^h312] roll[^h4039], and gave[^h5414] it to Baruch[^h1263] the scribe[^h5608], the son[^h1121] of Neriah[^h5374]; who wrote[^h3789] therein from the mouth[^h6310] of Jeremiah[^h3414] all the words[^h1697] of the book[^h5612] which Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] had burned[^h8313] in the fire[^h784]: and there were added[^h3254] besides unto them many[^h7227] like[^h1992] words[^h1697].

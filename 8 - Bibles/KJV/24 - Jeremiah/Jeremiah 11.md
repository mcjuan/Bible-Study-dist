###### 1
The word[^h1697] that came to Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Hear[^h8085] ye the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285], and speak[^h1696] unto the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and to the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389];
###### 3
And say[^h559] thou unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Cursed[^h779] be the man[^h376] that obeyeth[^h8085] not the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285],
###### 4
Which I commanded[^h6680] your fathers[^h1] in the day[^h3117] that I brought them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], from the iron[^h1270] furnace[^h3564], saying[^h559], Obey[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], and do[^h6213] them, according to all which I command[^h6680] you: so shall ye be my people[^h5971], and I will be your God[^h430]:
###### 5
That I may perform[^h6965] the oath[^h7621] which I have sworn[^h7650] unto your fathers[^h1], to give[^h5414] them a land[^h776] flowing[^h2100] with milk[^h2461] and honey[^h1706], as it is this day[^h3117]. Then answered[^h6030] I, and said[^h559], So be it[^h543], O LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 6
Then the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, Proclaim[^h7121] all these words[^h1697] in the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and in the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], Hear[^h8085] ye the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285], and do[^h6213] them.
###### 7
For I earnestly[^h5749] protested[^h5749] unto your fathers[^h1] in the day[^h3117] that I brought them up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], even unto this day[^h3117], rising early[^h7925] and protesting[^h5749], saying[^h559], Obey[^h8085] my voice[^h6963].
###### 8
Yet they obeyed[^h8085] not, nor inclined[^h5186] their ear[^h241], but walked[^h3212] every one[^h376] in the imagination[^h8307] of their evil[^h7451] heart[^h3820]: therefore I will bring[^h935] upon them all the words[^h1697] of this covenant[^h1285], which I commanded[^h6680] them to do[^h6213]; but they did[^h6213] them not. 
###### 9
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, A conspiracy[^h7195] is found[^h4672] among the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and among the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 10
They are turned back[^h7725] to the iniquities[^h5771] of their forefathers[^h7223] [^h1], which refused[^h3985] to hear[^h8085] my words[^h1697]; and they went[^h1980] after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430] to serve[^h5647] them: the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] and the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] have broken[^h6565] my covenant[^h1285] which I made[^h3772] with their fathers[^h1].
###### 11
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon them, which they shall not be able[^h3201] to escape[^h3318]; and though they shall cry[^h2199] unto me, I will not hearken[^h8085] unto them. 
###### 12
Then shall the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] and inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] go[^h1980], and cry[^h2199] unto the gods[^h430] unto whom they offer incense[^h6999]: but they shall not save[^h3467] them at all[^h3467] in the time[^h6256] of their trouble[^h7451]. 
###### 13
For according to the number[^h4557] of thy cities[^h5892] were thy gods[^h430], O Judah[^h3063]; and according to the number[^h4557] of the streets[^h2351] of Jerusalem[^h3389] have ye set up[^h7760] altars[^h4196] to that shameful thing[^h1322], even altars[^h4196] to burn incense[^h6999] unto Baal[^h1168]. 
###### 14
Therefore pray[^h6419] not thou for this people[^h5971], neither lift up[^h5375] a cry[^h7440] or prayer[^h8605] for them: for I will not hear[^h8085] them in the time[^h6256] that they cry[^h7121] unto me for their trouble[^h7451]. 
###### 15
What hath my beloved[^h3039] to do in mine house[^h1004], seeing she hath wrought[^h6213] lewdness[^h4209] with many[^h7227], and the holy[^h6944] flesh[^h1320] is passed[^h5674] from thee? when thou doest evil[^h7451], then thou rejoicest[^h5937].  
###### 16
The LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] thy name[^h8034], A green[^h7488] olive tree[^h2132], fair[^h3303], and of goodly[^h8389] fruit[^h6529]: with the noise[^h6963] of a great[^h1419] tumult[^h1999] he hath kindled[^h3341] fire[^h784] upon it, and the branches[^h1808] of it are broken[^h7489].
###### 17
For the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], that planted[^h5193] thee, hath pronounced[^h1696] evil[^h7451] against thee, for[^h1558] the evil[^h7451] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] and of the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063], which they have done[^h6213] against themselves to provoke me to anger[^h3707] in offering incense[^h6999] unto Baal[^h1168].
###### 18
And the LORD[^h3068] hath given me knowledge[^h3045] of it, and I know[^h3045] it: then thou shewedst[^h7200] me their doings[^h4611].
###### 19
But I was like a lamb[^h3532] or an ox[^h441] that is brought[^h2986] to the slaughter[^h2873]; and I knew[^h3045] not that they had devised[^h2803] devices[^h4284] against me, saying, Let us destroy[^h7843] the tree[^h6086] with the fruit[^h3899] thereof, and let us cut him off[^h3772] from the land[^h776] of the living[^h2416], that his name[^h8034] may be no more remembered[^h2142]. 
###### 20
But, O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], that judgest[^h8199] righteously[^h6664], that triest[^h974] the reins[^h3629] and the heart[^h3820], let me see[^h7200] thy vengeance[^h5360] on them: for unto thee have I revealed[^h1540] my cause[^h7379].
###### 21
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of the men[^h582] of Anathoth[^h6068], that seek[^h1245] thy life[^h5315], saying[^h559], Prophesy[^h5012] not in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], that thou die[^h4191] not by our hand[^h3027]:
###### 22
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], Behold, I will punish[^h6485] them: the young men[^h970] shall die[^h4191] by the sword[^h2719]; their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323] shall die[^h4191] by famine[^h7458]: 
###### 23
And there shall be no remnant[^h7611] of them: for I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon the men[^h582] of Anathoth[^h6068], even the year[^h8141] of their visitation[^h6486].

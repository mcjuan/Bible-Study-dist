###### 1
Then Shephatiah[^h8203] the son[^h1121] of Mattan[^h4977], and Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Pashur[^h6583], and Jucal[^h3116] the son[^h1121] of Shelemiah[^h8018], and Pashur[^h6583] the son[^h1121] of Malchiah[^h4441], heard[^h8085] the words[^h1697] that Jeremiah[^h3414] had spoken[^h1696] unto all the people[^h5971], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], He that remaineth[^h3427] in this city[^h5892] shall die[^h4191] by the sword[^h2719], by the famine[^h7458], and by the pestilence[^h1698]: but he that goeth forth[^h3318] to the Chaldeans[^h3778] shall live[^h2421]; for he shall have his life[^h5315] for a prey[^h7998], and shall live[^h2421] [^h2425].
###### 3
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], This city[^h5892] shall surely[^h5414] be given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] army[^h2428], which shall take[^h3920] it.
###### 4
Therefore the princes[^h8269] said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428], We beseech thee, let this man[^h376] be put to death[^h4191]: for thus[^h3651] he weakeneth[^h7503] the hands[^h3027] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] that remain[^h7604] in this city[^h5892], and the hands[^h3027] of all the people[^h5971], in speaking[^h1696] such words[^h1697] unto them: for this man[^h376] seeketh[^h1875] not the welfare[^h7965] of this people[^h5971], but the hurt[^h7451]. 
###### 5
Then Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Behold, he is in your hand[^h3027]: for the king[^h4428] is not he that can[^h3201] do any thing[^h1697] against you.
###### 6
Then took[^h3947] they Jeremiah[^h3414], and cast[^h7993] him into the dungeon[^h953] of Malchiah[^h4441] the son[^h1121] of Hammelech[^h4428], that was in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307]: and they let down[^h7971] Jeremiah[^h3414] with cords[^h2256]. And in the dungeon[^h953] there was no water[^h4325], but mire[^h2916]: so Jeremiah[^h3414] sunk[^h2883] in the mire[^h2916]. 
###### 7
Now when Ebedmelech[^h5663] the Ethiopian[^h3569], one[^h376] of the eunuchs[^h5631] which was in the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], heard[^h8085] that they had put[^h5414] Jeremiah[^h3414] in the dungeon[^h953]; the king[^h4428] then sitting[^h3427] in the gate[^h8179] of Benjamin[^h1144];
###### 8
Ebedmelech[^h5663] went forth[^h3318] out of the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004], and spake[^h1696] to the king[^h4428], saying[^h559],
###### 9
My lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], these men[^h582] have done evil[^h7489] in all that they have done[^h6213] to Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030], whom they have cast[^h7993] into the dungeon[^h953]; and he is like to die[^h4191] for[^h6440] hunger[^h7458] in the place[^h8478] where he is: for there is no more bread[^h3899] in the city[^h5892]. 
###### 10
Then the king[^h4428] commanded[^h6680] Ebedmelech[^h5663] the Ethiopian[^h3569], saying[^h559], Take[^h3947] from hence thirty[^h7970] men[^h582] with thee[^h3027], and take up[^h5927] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] out of the dungeon[^h953], before he die[^h4191]. 
###### 11
So Ebedmelech[^h5663] took[^h3947] the men[^h582] with him[^h3027], and went[^h935] into the house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428] under the treasury[^h214], and took[^h3947] thence old[^h1094] cast clouts[^h5499] and old[^h1094] rotten rags[^h4418], and let them down[^h7971] by cords[^h2256] into the dungeon[^h953] to Jeremiah[^h3414].
###### 12
And Ebedmelech[^h5663] the Ethiopian[^h3569] said[^h559] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], Put[^h7760] now these old[^h1094] cast clouts[^h5499] and rotten rags[^h4418] under thine armholes[^h679] [^h3027] under the cords[^h2256]. And Jeremiah[^h3414] did[^h6213] so.
###### 13
So they drew up[^h4900] Jeremiah[^h3414] with cords[^h2256], and took him up[^h5927] out of the dungeon[^h953]: and Jeremiah[^h3414] remained[^h3427] in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307].
###### 14
Then Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971], and took[^h3947] Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] unto him into the third[^h7992] entry[^h3996] that is in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: and the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], I will ask[^h7592] thee a thing[^h1697]; hide[^h3582] nothing from me. 
###### 15
Then Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] unto Zedekiah[^h6667], If I declare[^h5046] it unto thee, wilt thou not surely[^h4191] put me to death[^h4191]? and if I give thee counsel[^h3289], wilt thou not hearken[^h8085] unto me?
###### 16
So Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] sware[^h7650] secretly[^h5643] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], that made[^h6213] us this soul[^h5315], I will not put thee to death[^h4191], neither will I give[^h5414] thee into the hand[^h3027] of these men[^h582] that seek[^h1245] thy life[^h5315].
###### 17
Then said[^h559] Jeremiah[^h3414] unto Zedekiah[^h6667], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; If thou wilt assuredly[^h3318] go forth[^h3318] unto the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] princes[^h8269], then thy soul[^h5315] shall live[^h2421], and this city[^h5892] shall not be burned[^h8313] with fire[^h784]; and thou shalt live[^h2421], and thine house[^h1004]:
###### 18
But if thou wilt not go forth[^h3318] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] princes[^h8269], then shall this city[^h5892] be given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], and they shall burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784], and thou shalt not escape out[^h4422] of their hand[^h3027].
###### 19
And Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], I am afraid[^h1672] of the Jews[^h3064] that are fallen[^h5307] to the Chaldeans[^h3778], lest they deliver[^h5414] me into their hand[^h3027], and they mock[^h5953] me.
###### 20
But Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559], They shall not deliver[^h5414] thee. Obey[^h8085], I beseech thee, the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], which I speak[^h1696] unto thee: so it shall be well[^h3190] unto thee, and thy soul[^h5315] shall live[^h2421].
###### 21
But if thou refuse[^h3986] to go forth[^h3318], this is the word[^h1697] that the LORD[^h3068] hath shewed[^h7200] me:
###### 22
And, behold, all the women[^h802] that are left[^h7604] in the king[^h4428] of Judah's[^h3063] house[^h1004] shall be brought forth[^h3318] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] princes[^h8269], and those women shall say[^h559], Thy friends[^h582] [^h7965] have set thee on[^h5496], and have prevailed[^h3201] against thee: thy feet[^h7272] are sunk[^h2883] in the mire[^h1206], and they are turned away[^h5472] back[^h268]. 
###### 23
So they shall bring out[^h3318] all thy wives[^h802] and thy children[^h1121] to the Chaldeans[^h3778]: and thou shalt not escape out[^h4422] of their hand[^h3027], but shalt be taken[^h8610] by the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]: and thou shalt cause this city[^h5892] to be burned[^h8313] with fire[^h784]. 
###### 24
Then said[^h559] Zedekiah[^h6667] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], Let no man[^h376] know[^h3045] of these words[^h1697], and thou shalt not die[^h4191].
###### 25
But if the princes[^h8269] hear[^h8085] that I have talked[^h1696] with thee, and they come[^h935] unto thee, and say[^h559] unto thee, Declare[^h5046] unto us now what thou hast said[^h1696] unto the king[^h4428], hide[^h3582] it not from us, and we will not put thee to death[^h4191]; also what the king[^h4428] said[^h1696] unto thee:
###### 26
Then thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, I presented[^h5307] my supplication[^h8467] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428], that he would not cause me to return[^h7725] to Jonathan's[^h3083] house[^h1004], to die[^h4191] there.
###### 27
Then came[^h935] all the princes[^h8269] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], and asked[^h7592] him: and he told[^h5046] them according to all these words[^h1697] that the king[^h4428] had commanded[^h6680]. So they left off speaking[^h2790] with him; for the matter[^h1697] was not perceived[^h8085]. 
###### 28
So Jeremiah[^h3414] abode[^h3427] in the court[^h2691] of the prison[^h4307] until the day[^h3117] that Jerusalem[^h3389] was taken[^h3920]: and he was there when Jerusalem[^h3389] was taken[^h3920].

###### 1
Zedekiah[^h6667] was one[^h259] and twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141] old[^h1121] when he began to reign[^h4427], and he reigned[^h4427] eleven[^h259] [^h6240] years[^h8141] in Jerusalem[^h3389]. And his mother's[^h517] name[^h8034] was Hamutal[^h2537] the daughter[^h1323] of Jeremiah[^h3414] of Libnah[^h3841]. 
###### 2
And he did[^h6213] that which was evil[^h7451] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], according to all that Jehoiakim[^h3079] had done[^h6213].
###### 3
For through[^h5921] the anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] it came to pass in Jerusalem[^h3389] and Judah[^h3063], till he had cast them out[^h7993] from his presence[^h6440], that Zedekiah[^h6667] rebelled[^h4775] against the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894].
###### 4
And it came to pass in the ninth[^h8671] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427], in the tenth[^h6224] month[^h2320], in the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], that Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came[^h935], he and all his army[^h2428], against Jerusalem[^h3389], and pitched[^h2583] against it, and built[^h1129] forts[^h1785] against it round about[^h5439].
###### 5
So[^h935] the city[^h5892] was besieged[^h4692] unto the eleventh[^h6249] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667].
###### 6
And in the fourth[^h7243] month[^h2320], in the ninth[^h8672] day of the month[^h2320], the famine[^h7458] was sore[^h2388] in the city[^h5892], so that there was no bread[^h3899] for the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776].
###### 7
Then the city[^h5892] was broken up[^h1234], and all the men[^h582] of war[^h4421] fled[^h1272], and went forth[^h3318] out of the city[^h5892] by night[^h3915] by the way[^h1870] of the gate[^h8179] between the two walls[^h2346], which was by the king's[^h4428] garden[^h1588]; (now the Chaldeans[^h3778] were by the city[^h5892] round about[^h5439]:) and they went[^h3212] by the way[^h1870] of the plain[^h6160].
###### 8
But the army[^h2428] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] the king[^h4428], and overtook[^h5381] Zedekiah[^h6667] in the plains[^h6160] of Jericho[^h3405]; and all his army[^h2428] was scattered[^h6327] from him.
###### 9
Then they took[^h8610] the king[^h4428], and carried him up[^h5927] unto the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] to Riblah[^h7247] in the land[^h776] of Hamath[^h2574]; where he gave[^h1696] judgment[^h4941] upon him.
###### 10
And the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] slew[^h7819] the sons[^h1121] of Zedekiah[^h6667] before his eyes[^h5869]: he slew[^h7819] also all the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063] in Riblah[^h7247].
###### 11
Then he put out[^h5786] the eyes[^h5869] of Zedekiah[^h6667]; and the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] bound[^h631] him in chains[^h5178], and carried[^h935] him to Babylon[^h894], and put[^h5414] him in prison[^h1004] [^h6486] till the day[^h3117] of his death[^h4194].   
###### 12
Now in the fifth[^h2549] month[^h2320], in the tenth[^h6218] day of the month[^h2320], which was the nineteenth[^h8672] [^h6240] [^h8141] year[^h8141] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], came[^h935] Nebuzaradan[^h5018], captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876], which served[^h5975] [^h6440] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], into Jerusalem[^h3389],  
###### 13
And burned[^h8313] the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the king's[^h4428] house[^h1004]; and all the houses[^h1004] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and all the houses[^h1004] of the great[^h1419] men, burned[^h8313] he with fire[^h784]:
###### 14
And all the army[^h2428] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], that were with the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876], brake down[^h5422] all the walls[^h2346] of Jerusalem[^h3389] round about[^h5439].
###### 15
Then Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] carried away captive[^h1540] certain of the poor[^h1803] of the people[^h5971], and the residue[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] that remained[^h7604] in the city[^h5892], and those that fell away[^h5307], that fell[^h5307] to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and the rest[^h3499] of the multitude[^h527].
###### 16
But Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] left[^h7604] certain of the poor[^h1803] of the land[^h776] for vinedressers[^h3755] and for husbandmen[^h3009].
###### 17
Also the pillars[^h5982] of brass[^h5178] that were in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and the bases[^h4350], and the brasen[^h5178] sea[^h3220] that was in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], the Chaldeans[^h3778] brake[^h7665], and carried[^h5375] all the brass[^h5178] of them to Babylon[^h894].
###### 18
The caldrons[^h5518] also, and the shovels[^h3257], and the snuffers[^h4212], and the bowls[^h4219], and the spoons[^h3709], and all the vessels[^h3627] of brass[^h5178] wherewith they ministered[^h8334], took they away[^h3947].  
###### 19
And the basons[^h5592], and the firepans[^h4289], and the bowls[^h4219], and the caldrons[^h5518], and the candlesticks[^h4501], and the spoons[^h3709], and the cups[^h4518]; that which was of gold[^h2091] in gold[^h2091], and that which was of silver[^h3701] in silver[^h3701], took[^h3947] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] away[^h3947]. 
###### 20
The two[^h8147] pillars[^h5982], one[^h259] sea[^h3220], and twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] brasen[^h5178] bulls[^h1241] that were under the bases[^h4350], which king[^h4428] Solomon[^h8010] had made[^h6213] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]: the brass[^h5178] of all these vessels[^h3627] was without weight[^h4948]. 
###### 21
And concerning the pillars[^h5982], the height[^h6967] of one[^h259] pillar[^h5982] was eighteen[^h8083] [^h6240] cubits[^h520]; and a fillet[^h2339] of twelve[^h8147] [^h6240] cubits[^h520] did compass[^h5437] it; and the thickness[^h5672] thereof was four[^h702] fingers[^h676]: it was hollow[^h5014]. 
###### 22
And a chapiter[^h3805] of brass[^h5178] was upon it; and the height[^h6967] of one[^h259] chapiter[^h3805] was five[^h2568] cubits[^h520], with network[^h7639] and pomegranates[^h7416] upon the chapiters[^h3805] round about[^h5439], all of brass[^h5178]. The second[^h8145] pillar[^h5982] also and the pomegranates[^h7416] were like unto these.
###### 23
And there were ninety[^h8673] and six[^h8337] pomegranates[^h7416] on a side[^h7307]; and all the pomegranates[^h7416] upon the network[^h7639] were an hundred[^h3967] round about[^h5439].
###### 24
And the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took[^h3947] Seraiah[^h8304] the chief[^h7218] priest[^h3548], and Zephaniah[^h6846] the second[^h4932] priest[^h3548], and the three[^h7969] keepers[^h8104] of the door[^h5592]: 
###### 25
He took[^h3947] also out of the city[^h5892] an[^h259] eunuch[^h5631], which had the charge[^h6496] of the men[^h582] of war[^h4421]; and seven[^h7651] men[^h582] of them that were near[^h7200] the king's[^h4428] person[^h6440], which were found[^h4672] in the city[^h5892]; and the principal[^h8269] scribe[^h5608] of the host[^h6635], who mustered[^h6633] the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776]; and threescore[^h8346] men[^h376] of the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], that were found[^h4672] in the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892].  
###### 26
So Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took[^h3947] them, and brought[^h3212] them to the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] to Riblah[^h7247].
###### 27
And the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] smote[^h5221] them, and put them to death[^h4191] in Riblah[^h7247] in the land[^h127] of Hamath[^h2574]. Thus Judah[^h3063] was carried away captive[^h1540] out of his own land[^h776].
###### 28
This is the people[^h5971] whom Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] carried away captive[^h1540]: in the seventh[^h7651] year[^h8141] three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] Jews[^h3064] and three[^h7969] and twenty[^h6242]:
###### 29
In the eighteenth[^h8083] [^h6240] year[^h8141] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] he carried away captive[^h1540] from Jerusalem[^h3389] eight[^h8083] hundred[^h3967] thirty[^h7970] and two[^h8147] persons[^h5315]: 
###### 30
In the three[^h7969] and twentieth[^h6242] year[^h8141] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] carried away captive[^h1540] of the Jews[^h3064] seven[^h7651] hundred[^h3967] forty[^h705] and five[^h2568] persons[^h5315]: all the persons[^h5315] were four[^h702] thousand[^h505] and six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967].
###### 31
And it came to pass in the seven[^h7651] and thirtieth[^h7970] year[^h8141] of the captivity[^h1546] of Jehoiachin[^h3078] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], in the twelfth[^h8147] [^h6240] month[^h2320], in the five[^h2568] and twentieth[^h6242] day of the month[^h2320], that Evilmerodach[^h192] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] in the first year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4438] lifted up[^h5375] the head[^h7218] of Jehoiachin[^h3078] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and brought him forth[^h3318] out of prison[^h1004] [^h3628],
###### 32
And spake[^h1696] kindly[^h2896] unto him, and set[^h5414] his throne[^h3678] above[^h4605] the throne[^h3678] of the kings[^h4428] that were with him in Babylon[^h894], 
###### 33
And changed[^h8138] his prison[^h3608] garments[^h899]: and he did continually[^h8548] eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] before[^h6440] him all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].
###### 34
And for his diet[^h737], there was a continual[^h8548] diet[^h737] given[^h5414] him of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], every[^h3117] day[^h3117] a portion[^h1697] until the day[^h3117] of his death[^h4194], all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].

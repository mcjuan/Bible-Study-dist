###### 1
The word[^h1697] which came unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068] in the days[^h3117] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Go[^h1980] unto the house[^h1004] of the Rechabites[^h7397], and speak[^h1696] unto them, and bring[^h935] them into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], into one[^h259] of the chambers[^h3957], and give them wine[^h3196] to drink[^h8248].
###### 3
Then I took[^h3947] Jaazaniah[^h2970] the son[^h1121] of Jeremiah[^h3414], the son[^h1121] of Habaziniah[^h2262], and his brethren[^h251], and all his sons[^h1121], and the whole house[^h1004] of the Rechabites[^h7397];
###### 4
And I brought[^h935] them into the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], into the chamber[^h3957] of the sons[^h1121] of Hanan[^h2605], the son[^h1121] of Igdaliah[^h3012], a man[^h376] of God[^h430], which was by[^h681] the chamber[^h3957] of the princes[^h8269], which was above[^h4605] the chamber[^h3957] of Maaseiah[^h4641] the son[^h1121] of Shallum[^h7967], the keeper[^h8104] of the door[^h5592]: 
###### 5
And I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] the sons[^h1121] of the house[^h1004] of the Rechabites[^h7397] pots[^h1375] full[^h4392] of wine[^h3196], and cups[^h3563], and I said[^h559] unto them, Drink[^h8354] ye wine[^h3196].
###### 6
But they said[^h559], We will drink[^h8354] no wine[^h3196]: for Jonadab[^h3122] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394] our father[^h1] commanded[^h6680] us, saying[^h559], Ye shall drink[^h8354] no wine[^h3196], neither ye, nor your sons[^h1121] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]:
###### 7
Neither shall ye build[^h1129] house[^h1004], nor sow[^h2232] seed[^h2233], nor plant[^h5193] vineyard[^h3754], nor have any: but all your days[^h3117] ye shall dwell[^h3427] in tents[^h168]; that ye may live[^h2421] many[^h7227] days[^h3117] in[^h6440] the land[^h127] where ye be strangers[^h1481].
###### 8
Thus have we obeyed[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of Jonadab[^h3082] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394] our father[^h1] in all that he hath charged[^h6680] us, to drink[^h8354] no wine[^h3196] all our days[^h3117], we, our wives[^h802], our sons[^h1121], nor our daughters[^h1323];
###### 9
Nor to build[^h1129] houses[^h1004] for us to dwell in[^h3427]: neither have we vineyard[^h3754], nor field[^h7704], nor seed[^h2233]:
###### 10
But we have dwelt in[^h3427] tents[^h168], and have obeyed[^h8085], and done[^h6213] according to all that Jonadab[^h3122] our father[^h1] commanded[^h6680] us.
###### 11
But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] came up[^h5927] into the land[^h776], that we said[^h559], Come[^h935], and let us go[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389] for fear[^h6440] of the army[^h2428] of the Chaldeans[^h3778], and for fear[^h6440] of the army[^h2428] of the Syrians[^h758]: so we dwell[^h3427] at Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 12
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 13
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Go[^h1980] and tell[^h559] the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] and the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], Will ye not receive[^h3947] instruction[^h4148] to hearken[^h8085] to my words[^h1697]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
The words[^h1697] of Jonadab[^h3082] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394], that he commanded[^h6680] his sons[^h1121] not to drink[^h8354] wine[^h3196], are performed[^h6965]; for unto this day[^h3117] they drink[^h8354] none, but obey[^h8085] their father's[^h1] commandment[^h4687]: notwithstanding I have spoken[^h1696] unto you, rising early[^h7925] and speaking[^h1696]; but ye hearkened[^h8085] not unto me.
###### 15
I have sent[^h7971] also unto you all my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], rising up early[^h7925] and sending[^h7971] them, saying[^h559], Return[^h7725] ye now every man[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], and amend[^h3190] your doings[^h4611], and go[^h3212] not after[^h310] other[^h312] gods[^h430] to serve[^h5647] them, and ye shall dwell in[^h3427] the land[^h127] which I have given[^h5414] to you and to your fathers[^h1]: but ye have not inclined[^h5186] your ear[^h241], nor hearkened[^h8085] unto me.
###### 16
Because the sons[^h1121] of Jonadab[^h3082] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394] have performed[^h6965] the commandment[^h4687] of their father[^h1], which he commanded[^h6680] them; but this people[^h5971] hath not hearkened[^h8085] unto me:
###### 17
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will bring[^h935] upon Judah[^h3063] and upon all the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389] all the evil[^h7451] that I have pronounced[^h1696] against them: because I have spoken[^h1696] unto them, but they have not heard[^h8085]; and I have called[^h7121] unto them, but they have not answered[^h6030].
###### 18
And Jeremiah[^h3414] said[^h559] unto the house[^h1004] of the Rechabites[^h7397], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Because ye have obeyed[^h8085] the commandment[^h4687] of Jonadab[^h3082] your father[^h1], and kept[^h8104] all his precepts[^h4687], and done[^h6213] according unto all that he hath commanded[^h6680] you:
###### 19
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Jonadab[^h3122] the son[^h1121] of Rechab[^h7394] shall not want[^h3772] a man[^h376] to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] me for ever[^h3117].

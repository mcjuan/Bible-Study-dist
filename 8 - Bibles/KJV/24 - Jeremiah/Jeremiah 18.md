###### 1
The word[^h1697] which came to Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Arise[^h6965], and go down[^h3381] to the potter's[^h3335] house[^h1004], and there I will cause thee to hear[^h8085] my words[^h1697].
###### 3
Then I went down[^h3381] to the potter's[^h3335] house[^h1004], and, behold[^h2009], he wrought[^h6213] a work[^h4399] on the wheels[^h70]. 
###### 4
And the vessel[^h3627] that he made[^h6213] of clay[^h2563] was marred[^h7843] in the hand[^h3027] of the potter[^h3335]: so he made[^h6213] it again[^h7725] another[^h312] vessel[^h3627], as seemed[^h5869] good[^h3474] to the potter[^h3335] to make[^h6213] it.  
###### 5
Then the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to me, saying[^h559],
###### 6
O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], cannot[^h3201] I do[^h6213] with you as this potter[^h3335]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. Behold, as the clay[^h2563] is in the potter's[^h3335] hand[^h3027], so are ye in mine hand[^h3027], O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 7
At what instant[^h7281] I shall speak[^h1696] concerning a nation[^h1471], and concerning a kingdom[^h4467], to pluck up[^h5428], and to pull down[^h5422], and to destroy[^h6] it;
###### 8
If that nation[^h1471], against whom I have pronounced[^h1696], turn[^h7725] from their evil[^h7451], I will repent[^h5162] of the evil[^h7451] that I thought[^h2803] to do[^h6213] unto them.
###### 9
And at what instant[^h7281] I shall speak[^h1696] concerning a nation[^h1471], and concerning a kingdom[^h4467], to build[^h1129] and to plant[^h5193] it;
###### 10
If it do[^h6213] evil[^h7451] in my sight[^h5869], that it obey[^h8085] not my voice[^h6963], then I will repent[^h5162] of the good[^h2896], wherewith I said[^h559] I would benefit[^h3190] them.
###### 11
Now therefore go to, speak[^h559] to the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and to the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I frame[^h3335] evil[^h7451] against you, and devise[^h2803] a device[^h4284] against you: return[^h7725] ye now every one[^h376] from his evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], and make your ways[^h1870] and your doings[^h4611] good[^h3190].
###### 12
And they said[^h559], There is no hope[^h2976]: but we will walk[^h3212] after[^h310] our own devices[^h4284], and we will every one[^h376] do[^h6213] the imagination[^h8307] of his evil[^h7451] heart[^h3820].
###### 13
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Ask[^h7592] ye now among the heathen[^h1471], who hath heard[^h8085] such things: the virgin[^h1330] of Israel[^h3478] hath done[^h6213] a very[^h3966] horrible thing[^h8186].
###### 14
Will a man leave[^h5800] the snow[^h7950] of Lebanon[^h3844] which cometh from the rock[^h6697] of the field[^h7704]? or shall the cold[^h7119] flowing[^h5140] waters[^h4325] that come from another place[^h2114] be forsaken[^h5428]? 
###### 15
Because my people[^h5971] hath forgotten[^h7911] me, they have burned incense[^h6999] to vanity[^h7723], and they have caused them to stumble[^h3782] in their ways[^h1870] from the ancient[^h5769] paths[^h7635] [^h7635], to walk[^h3212] in paths[^h5410], in a way[^h1870] not cast up[^h5549];
###### 16
To make[^h7760] their land[^h776] desolate[^h8047], and a perpetual[^h5769] hissing[^h8292] [^h8292]; every one that passeth[^h5674] thereby shall be astonished[^h8074], and wag[^h5110] his head[^h7218].
###### 17
I will scatter[^h6327] them as with an east[^h6921] wind[^h7307] before[^h6440] the enemy[^h341]; I will shew[^h7200] them the back[^h6203], and not the face[^h6440], in the day[^h3117] of their calamity[^h343].
###### 18
Then said[^h559] they, Come[^h3212], and let us devise[^h2803] devices[^h4284] against Jeremiah[^h3414]; for the law[^h8451] shall not perish[^h6] from the priest[^h3548], nor counsel[^h6098] from the wise[^h2450], nor the word[^h1697] from the prophet[^h5030]. Come[^h3212], and let us smite[^h5221] him with the tongue[^h3956], and let us not give heed[^h7181] to any of his words[^h1697]. 
###### 19
Give heed[^h7181] to me, O LORD[^h3068], and hearken[^h8085] to the voice[^h6963] of them that contend[^h3401] with me.
###### 20
Shall evil[^h7451] be recompensed[^h7999] for good[^h2896]? for they have digged[^h3738] a pit[^h7745] for my soul[^h5315]. Remember[^h2142] that I stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] thee to speak[^h1696] good[^h2896] for them, and to turn away[^h7725] thy wrath[^h2534] from them.
###### 21
Therefore deliver up[^h5414] their children[^h1121] to the famine[^h7458], and pour out[^h5064] their blood by the force[^h3027] of the sword[^h2719]; and let their wives[^h802] be bereaved[^h7909] of their children, and be widows[^h490]; and let their men[^h582] be put[^h2026] to death[^h4194]; let their young men[^h970] be slain[^h5221] by the sword[^h2719] in battle[^h4421]. 
###### 22
Let a cry[^h2201] be heard[^h8085] from their houses[^h1004], when thou shalt bring[^h935] a troop[^h1416] suddenly[^h6597] upon them: for they have digged[^h3738] a pit[^h7745] [^h7882] to take[^h3920] me, and hid[^h2934] snares[^h6341] for my feet[^h7272].
###### 23
Yet, LORD[^h3068], thou knowest[^h3045] all their counsel[^h6098] against me to slay[^h4194] me: forgive[^h3722] not their iniquity[^h5771], neither blot out[^h4229] their sin[^h2403] from thy sight[^h6440], but let them be overthrown[^h3782] before[^h6440] thee; deal[^h6213] thus with them in the time[^h6256] of thine anger[^h639].

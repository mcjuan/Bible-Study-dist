###### 1
The word[^h1697] that came to Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], after[^h310] that Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] had let him go[^h7971] from Ramah[^h7414], when he had taken[^h3947] him being bound[^h631] in chains[^h246] among[^h8432] all that were carried away captive[^h1546] of Jerusalem[^h3389] and Judah[^h3063], which were carried away captive[^h1540] unto Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 2
And the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] took[^h3947] Jeremiah[^h3414], and said[^h559] unto him, The LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430] hath pronounced[^h1696] this evil[^h7451] upon this place[^h4725].
###### 3
Now the LORD[^h3068] hath brought[^h935] it, and done[^h6213] according as he hath said[^h1696]: because ye have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], and have not obeyed[^h8085] his voice[^h6963], therefore this thing[^h1697] is come upon you.
###### 4
And now, behold, I loose[^h6605] thee this day[^h3117] from the chains[^h246] which were upon thine hand[^h3027]. If it seem good[^h2896] [^h5869] unto thee to come[^h935] with me into Babylon[^h894], come[^h935]; and I will look well[^h7760] [^h5869] unto thee: but if it seem ill[^h7489] [^h5869] unto thee to come[^h935] with me into Babylon[^h894], forbear[^h2308]: behold[^h7200], all the land[^h776] is before[^h6440] thee: whither it seemeth[^h413] good[^h2896] and convenient[^h3477] [^h5869] for thee to go[^h3212], thither go[^h3212].  
###### 5
Now while he was not yet gone back[^h7725], he said, Go back[^h7725] also to Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], whom the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] hath made governor[^h6485] over the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063], and dwell[^h3427] with him among[^h8432] the people[^h5971]: or go[^h3212] wheresoever it seemeth convenient[^h3477] [^h5869] unto thee to go[^h3212]. So the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] gave[^h5414] him victuals[^h737] and a reward[^h4864], and let him go[^h7971].
###### 6
Then went[^h935] Jeremiah[^h3414] unto Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] to Mizpah[^h4708]; and dwelt[^h3427] with him among[^h8432] the people[^h5971] that were left[^h7604] in the land[^h776].
###### 7
Now when all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428] which were in the fields[^h7704], even they and their men[^h582], heard[^h8085] that the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had made Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] governor[^h6485] in the land[^h776], and had committed[^h6485] unto him men[^h582], and women[^h802], and children[^h2945], and of the poor[^h1803] of the land[^h776], of them that were not carried away captive[^h1540] to Babylon[^h894];
###### 8
Then they came[^h935] to Gedaliah[^h1436] to Mizpah[^h4708], even Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], and Johanan[^h3110] and Jonathan[^h3129] the sons[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and Seraiah[^h8304] the son[^h1121] of Tanhumeth[^h8576], and the sons[^h1121] of Ephai[^h5778] the Netophathite[^h5200], and Jezaniah[^h3153] the son[^h1121] of a Maachathite[^h4602], they and their men[^h582].
###### 9
And Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227] sware[^h7650] unto them and to their men[^h582], saying[^h559], Fear[^h3372] not to serve[^h5647] the Chaldeans[^h3778]: dwell in[^h3427] the land[^h776], and serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and it shall be well[^h3190] with you.
###### 10
As for me, behold, I will dwell[^h3427] at Mizpah[^h4709] to serve[^h5975] [^h6440] the Chaldeans[^h3778], which will come[^h935] unto us: but ye, gather[^h622] ye wine[^h3196], and summer fruits[^h7019], and oil[^h8081], and put[^h7760] them in your vessels[^h3627], and dwell[^h3427] in your cities[^h5892] that ye have taken[^h8610]. 
###### 11
Likewise when all the Jews[^h3064] that were in Moab[^h4124], and among the Ammonites[^h5983], and in Edom[^h123], and that were in all the countries[^h776], heard[^h8085] that the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had left[^h5414] a remnant[^h7611] of Judah[^h3063], and that he had set[^h6485] over them Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227];
###### 12
Even all the Jews[^h3064] returned out[^h7725] of all places[^h4725] whither they were driven[^h5080], and came[^h935] to the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063], to Gedaliah[^h1436], unto Mizpah[^h4708], and gathered[^h622] wine[^h3196] and summer fruits[^h7019] very[^h3966] much[^h7235].
###### 13
Moreover Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428] that were in the fields[^h7704], came[^h935] to Gedaliah[^h1436] to Mizpah[^h4708],
###### 14
And said[^h559] unto him, Dost thou certainly[^h3045] know[^h3045] that Baalis[^h1185] the king[^h4428] of the Ammonites[^h1121] [^h5983] hath sent[^h7971] Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] to slay[^h5221] [^h5315] thee? But Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] believed[^h539] them not. 
###### 15
Then Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143] spake[^h559] to Gedaliah[^h1436] in Mizpah[^h4709] secretly[^h5643], saying[^h559], Let me go[^h3212], I pray thee, and I will slay[^h5221] Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], and no man[^h376] shall know[^h3045] it: wherefore should he slay[^h5221] [^h5315] thee, that all the Jews[^h3064] which are gathered[^h6908] unto thee should be scattered[^h6327], and the remnant[^h7611] in Judah[^h3063] perish[^h6]?
###### 16
But Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] said[^h559] unto Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], Thou shalt not do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697]: for thou speakest[^h1696] falsely[^h8267] of Ishmael[^h3458].

###### 1
They say[^h559], If a man[^h376] put away[^h7971] his wife[^h802], and she go[^h1980] from him, and become another[^h312] man's[^h376], shall he return unto her again[^h7725]? shall not that land[^h776] be greatly[^h2610] polluted[^h2610]? but thou hast played the harlot[^h2181] with many[^h7227] lovers[^h7453]; yet return again[^h7725] to me, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 2
Lift up[^h5375] thine eyes[^h5869] unto the high places[^h8205], and see[^h7200] where[^h375] thou hast not been lien[^h7693] [^h7901] with. In the ways[^h1870] hast thou sat[^h3427] for them, as the Arabian[^h6163] in the wilderness[^h4057]; and thou hast polluted[^h2610] the land[^h776] with thy whoredoms[^h2184] and with thy wickedness[^h7451].
###### 3
Therefore the showers[^h7241] have been withholden[^h4513], and there hath been no latter rain[^h4456]; and thou hadst a whore's[^h2181] [^h802] forehead[^h4696], thou refusedst[^h3985] to be ashamed[^h3637].
###### 4
Wilt thou not from this time cry[^h7121] unto me, My father[^h1], thou art the guide[^h441] of my youth[^h5271]?
###### 5
Will he reserve[^h5201] his anger for ever[^h5769]? will he keep[^h8104] it to the end[^h5331]? Behold, thou hast spoken[^h1696] and done[^h6213] evil things[^h7451] as thou couldest[^h3201].
###### 6
The LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] also unto me in the days[^h3117] of Josiah[^h2977] the king[^h4428], Hast thou seen[^h7200] that which backsliding[^h4878] Israel[^h3478] hath done[^h6213]? she is gone up[^h1980] upon every high[^h1364] mountain[^h2022] and under[^h8478] every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086], and there hath played the harlot[^h2181].
###### 7
And I said[^h559] after[^h310] she had done[^h6213] all these things, Turn[^h7725] thou unto me. But she returned[^h7725] not. And her treacherous[^h901] sister[^h269] Judah[^h3063] saw[^h7200] it.
###### 8
And I saw[^h7200], when for all the causes[^h182] whereby backsliding[^h4878] Israel[^h3478] committed adultery[^h5003] I had put her away[^h7971], and given[^h5414] her a bill[^h5612] of divorce[^h3748]; yet her treacherous[^h898] sister[^h269] Judah[^h3063] feared[^h3372] not, but went[^h3212] and played the harlot[^h2181] also.
###### 9
And it came to pass through the lightness[^h6963] of her whoredom[^h2184], that she defiled[^h2610] the land[^h776], and committed adultery[^h5003] with stones[^h68] and with stocks[^h6086]. 
###### 10
And yet for all this her treacherous[^h901] sister[^h269] Judah[^h3063] hath not turned[^h7725] unto me with her whole heart[^h3820], but feignedly[^h8267], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto me, The backsliding[^h4878] Israel[^h3478] hath justified[^h6663] herself[^h5315] more than treacherous[^h898] Judah[^h3063].
###### 12
Go[^h1980] and proclaim[^h7121] these words[^h1697] toward the north[^h6828], and say[^h559], Return[^h7725], thou backsliding[^h4878] Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; and I will not cause mine anger[^h6440] to fall[^h5307] upon you: for I am merciful[^h2623], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and I will not keep[^h5201] anger for ever[^h5769].
###### 13
Only acknowledge[^h3045] thine iniquity[^h5771], that thou hast transgressed[^h6586] against the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], and hast scattered[^h6340] thy ways[^h1870] to the strangers[^h2114] under every green[^h7488] tree[^h6086], and ye have not obeyed[^h8085] my voice[^h6963], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 14
Turn[^h7725], O backsliding[^h7726] children[^h1121], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; for I am married[^h1166] unto you: and I will take[^h3947] you one[^h259] of a city[^h5892], and two[^h8147] of a family[^h4940], and I will bring[^h935] you to Zion[^h6726]:
###### 15
And I will give[^h5414] you pastors[^h7462] according to mine heart[^h3820], which shall feed[^h7462] you with knowledge[^h1844] and understanding[^h7919].
###### 16
And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied[^h7235] and increased[^h6509] in the land[^h776], in those days[^h3117], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], they shall say[^h559] no more, The ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068]: neither shall it come[^h5927] to mind[^h3820]: neither shall they remember[^h2142] it; neither shall they visit[^h6485] it; neither shall that be done[^h6213] any more.  
###### 17
At that time[^h6256] they shall call[^h7121] Jerusalem[^h3389] the throne[^h3678] of the LORD[^h3068]; and all the nations[^h1471] shall be gathered[^h6960] unto it, to the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], to Jerusalem[^h3389]: neither shall they walk[^h3212] any more after[^h310] the imagination[^h8307] of their evil[^h7451] heart[^h3820]. 
###### 18
In those days[^h3117] the house[^h1004] of Judah[^h3063] shall walk[^h3212] with the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], and they shall come[^h935] together[^h3162] out of the land[^h776] of the north[^h6828] to the land[^h776] that I have given for an inheritance[^h5157] unto your fathers[^h1].  
###### 19
But I said[^h559], How shall I put[^h7896] thee among the children[^h1121], and give[^h5414] thee a pleasant[^h2532] land[^h776], a goodly[^h6643] heritage[^h5159] of the hosts[^h6635] of nations[^h1471]? and I said[^h559], Thou shalt call[^h7121] me, My father[^h1]; and shalt not turn away[^h7725] from me[^h310].   
###### 20
Surely[^h403] as a wife[^h802] treacherously[^h898] departeth from her husband[^h7453], so have ye dealt treacherously[^h898] with me, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 21
A voice[^h6963] was heard[^h8085] upon the high places[^h8205], weeping[^h1065] and supplications[^h8469] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]: for they have perverted[^h5753] their way[^h1870], and they have forgotten[^h7911] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430].
###### 22
Return[^h7725], ye backsliding[^h7726] children[^h1121], and I will heal[^h7495] your backslidings[^h4878]. Behold, we come[^h857] unto thee; for thou art the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].
###### 23
Truly[^h403] in vain[^h8267] is salvation hoped for from the hills[^h1389], and from the multitude[^h1995] of mountains[^h2022]: truly[^h403] in the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] is the salvation[^h8668] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 24
For shame[^h1322] hath devoured[^h398] the labour[^h3018] of our fathers[^h1] from our youth[^h5271]; their flocks[^h6629] and their herds[^h1241], their sons[^h1121] and their daughters[^h1323].
###### 25
We lie down[^h7901] in our shame[^h1322], and our confusion[^h3639] covereth[^h3680] us: for we have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], we and our fathers[^h1], from our youth[^h5271] even unto this day[^h3117], and have not obeyed[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430].

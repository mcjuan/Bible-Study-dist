###### 1
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Go[^h1980] and get[^h7069] a potter's[^h3335] earthen[^h2789] bottle[^h1228], and take of the ancients[^h2205] of the people[^h5971], and of the ancients[^h2205] of the priests[^h3548];
###### 2
And go forth[^h3318] unto the valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], which is by the entry[^h6607] of the east[^h2777] gate[^h8179], and proclaim[^h7121] there the words[^h1697] that I shall tell[^h1696] thee, 
###### 3
And say[^h559], Hear[^h8085] ye the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], O kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389]; Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon this place[^h4725], the which whosoever heareth[^h8085], his ears[^h241] shall tingle[^h6750].
###### 4
Because they have forsaken[^h5800] me, and have estranged[^h5234] this place[^h4725], and have burned incense[^h6999] in it unto other[^h312] gods[^h430], whom neither they nor their fathers[^h1] have known[^h3045], nor the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and have filled[^h4390] this place[^h4725] with the blood[^h1818] of innocents[^h5355];
###### 5
They have built[^h1129] also the high places[^h1116] of Baal[^h1168], to burn[^h8313] their sons[^h1121] with fire[^h784] for burnt offerings[^h5930] unto Baal[^h1168], which I commanded[^h6680] not, nor spake[^h1696] it, neither came[^h5927] it into my mind[^h3820]:
###### 6
Therefore, behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that this place[^h4725] shall no more be called[^h7121] Tophet[^h8612], nor The valley[^h1516] of the son[^h1121] of Hinnom[^h2011], but The valley[^h1516] of slaughter[^h2028].
###### 7
And I will make void[^h1238] the counsel[^h6098] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] in this place[^h4725]; and I will cause them to fall[^h5307] by the sword[^h2719] before[^h6440] their enemies[^h341], and by the hands[^h3027] of them that seek[^h1245] their lives[^h5315]: and their carcases[^h5038] will I give[^h5414] to be meat[^h3978] for the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064], and for the beasts[^h929] of the earth[^h776].
###### 8
And I will make[^h7760] this city[^h5892] desolate[^h8047], and an hissing[^h8322]; every one that passeth[^h5674] thereby shall be astonished[^h8074] and hiss[^h8319] because of all the plagues[^h4347] thereof.
###### 9
And I will cause them to eat[^h398] the flesh[^h1320] of their sons[^h1121] and the flesh[^h1320] of their daughters[^h1323], and they shall eat[^h398] every one[^h376] the flesh[^h1320] of his friend[^h7453] in the siege[^h4692] and straitness[^h4689], wherewith their enemies[^h341], and they that seek[^h1245] their lives[^h5315], shall straiten[^h6693] them.
###### 10
Then shalt thou break[^h7665] the bottle[^h1228] in the sight[^h5869] of the men[^h582] that go[^h1980] with thee,
###### 11
And shalt say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; Even so[^h3602] will I break[^h7665] this people[^h5971] and this city[^h5892], as one breaketh[^h7665] a potter's[^h3335] vessel[^h3627], that cannot[^h3201] be made whole again[^h7495]: and they shall bury[^h6912] them in Tophet[^h8612], till there be no place[^h4725] to bury[^h6912]. 
###### 12
Thus will I do[^h6213] unto this place[^h4725], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and to the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof, and even make[^h5414] this city[^h5892] as Tophet[^h8612]:
###### 13
And the houses[^h1004] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and the houses[^h1004] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], shall be defiled[^h2931] as the place[^h4725] of Tophet[^h8612], because of all the houses[^h1004] upon whose roofs[^h1406] they have burned incense[^h6999] unto all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], and have poured out[^h5258] drink offerings[^h5262] unto other[^h312] gods[^h430].
###### 14
Then came[^h935] Jeremiah[^h3414] from Tophet[^h8612], whither the LORD[^h3068] had sent[^h7971] him to prophesy[^h5012]; and he stood[^h5975] in the court[^h2691] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004]; and said[^h559] to all the people[^h5971],
###### 15
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will bring[^h935] upon this city[^h5892] and upon all her towns[^h5892] all the evil[^h7451] that I have pronounced[^h1696] against it, because they have hardened[^h7185] their necks[^h6203], that they might not hear[^h8085] my words[^h1697].

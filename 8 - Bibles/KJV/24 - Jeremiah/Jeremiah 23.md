###### 1
Woe[^h1945] be unto the pastors[^h7462] that destroy[^h6] and scatter[^h6327] the sheep[^h6629] of my pasture[^h4830]! saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 2
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] against the pastors[^h7462] that feed[^h7462] my people[^h5971]; Ye have scattered[^h6327] my flock[^h6629], and driven them away[^h5080], and have not visited[^h6485] them: behold, I will visit[^h6485] upon you the evil[^h7455] of your doings[^h4611], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And I will gather[^h6908] the remnant[^h7611] of my flock[^h6629] out of all countries[^h776] whither I have driven[^h5080] them, and will bring them again[^h7725] to their folds[^h5116]; and they shall be fruitful[^h6509] and increase[^h7235].
###### 4
And I will set up[^h6965] shepherds[^h7462] over them which shall feed[^h7462] them: and they shall fear[^h3372] no more, nor be dismayed[^h2865], neither shall they be lacking[^h6485], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 5
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that I will raise[^h6965] unto David[^h1732] a righteous[^h6662] Branch[^h6780], and a King[^h4428] shall reign[^h4427] and prosper[^h7919], and shall execute[^h6213] judgment[^h4941] and justice[^h6666] in the earth[^h776].
###### 6
In his days[^h3117] Judah[^h3063] shall be saved[^h3467], and Israel[^h3478] shall dwell[^h7931] safely[^h983]: and this is his name[^h8034] whereby he shall be called[^h7121], THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS[^h3072]. 
###### 7
Therefore, behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that they shall no more say[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], which brought up[^h5927] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714];
###### 8
But, The LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], which brought up[^h5927] and which led[^h935] the seed[^h2233] of the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] out of the north[^h6828] country[^h776], and from all countries[^h776] whither I had driven[^h5080] them; and they shall dwell[^h3427] in their own land[^h127].
###### 9
Mine heart[^h3820] within[^h7130] me is broken[^h7665] because of the prophets[^h5030]; all my bones[^h6106] shake[^h7363]; I am like a drunken[^h7910] man[^h376], and like a man[^h1397] whom wine[^h3196] hath overcome[^h5674], because[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068], and because of the words[^h1697] of his holiness[^h6944].
###### 10
For the land[^h776] is full[^h4390] of adulterers[^h5003]; for because[^h6440] of swearing[^h423] the land[^h776] mourneth[^h56]; the pleasant places[^h4999] of the wilderness[^h4057] are dried up[^h3001], and their course[^h4794] is evil[^h7451], and their force[^h1369] is not right.  
###### 11
For both prophet[^h5030] and priest[^h3548] are profane[^h2610]; yea, in my house[^h1004] have I found[^h4672] their wickedness[^h7451], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 12
Wherefore their way[^h1870] shall be unto them as slippery[^h2519] ways in the darkness[^h653]: they shall be driven on[^h1760], and fall[^h5307] therein: for I will bring[^h935] evil[^h7451] upon them, even the year[^h8141] of their visitation[^h6486], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And I have seen[^h7200] folly[^h8604] in the prophets[^h5030] of Samaria[^h8111]; they prophesied[^h5012] in Baal[^h1168], and caused my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] to err[^h8582]. 
###### 14
I have seen[^h7200] also in the prophets[^h5030] of Jerusalem[^h3389] an horrible thing[^h8186]: they commit adultery[^h5003], and walk[^h1980] in lies[^h8267]: they strengthen[^h2388] also the hands[^h3027] of evildoers[^h7489], that none[^h376] doth return[^h7725] from his wickedness[^h7451]: they are all of them unto me as Sodom[^h5467], and the inhabitants[^h3427] thereof as Gomorrah[^h6017]. 
###### 15
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] concerning the prophets[^h5030]; Behold, I will feed[^h398] them with wormwood[^h3939], and make them drink[^h8248] the water[^h4325] of gall[^h7219]: for from the prophets[^h5030] of Jerusalem[^h3389] is profaneness[^h2613] gone forth[^h3318] into all the land[^h776]. 
###### 16
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], Hearken[^h8085] not unto the words[^h1697] of the prophets[^h5030] that prophesy[^h5012] unto you: they make you vain[^h1891]: they speak[^h1696] a vision[^h2377] of their own heart[^h3820], and not out of the mouth[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 17
They say[^h559] still[^h559] unto them that despise[^h5006] me, The LORD[^h3068] hath said[^h1696], Ye shall have peace[^h7965]; and they say[^h559] unto every one that walketh[^h1980] after the imagination[^h8307] of his own heart[^h3820], No evil[^h7451] shall come[^h935] upon you. 
###### 18
For who hath stood[^h5975] in the counsel[^h5475] of the LORD[^h3068], and hath perceived[^h7200] and heard[^h8085] his word[^h1697]? who hath marked[^h7181] his word[^h1697], and heard[^h8085] it? 
###### 19
Behold, a whirlwind[^h5591] of the LORD[^h3068] is gone forth[^h3318] in fury[^h2534], even a grievous[^h2342] whirlwind[^h5591]: it shall fall grievously[^h2342] upon the head[^h7218] of the wicked[^h7563].
###### 20
The anger[^h639] of the LORD[^h3068] shall not return[^h7725], until he have executed[^h6213], and till he have performed[^h6965] the thoughts[^h4209] of his heart[^h3820]: in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117] ye shall consider[^h995] it perfectly[^h998].
###### 21
I have not sent[^h7971] these prophets[^h5030], yet they ran[^h7323]: I have not spoken[^h1696] to them, yet they prophesied[^h5012].
###### 22
But if they had stood[^h5975] in my counsel[^h5475], and had caused my people[^h5971] to hear[^h8085] my words[^h1697], then they should have turned[^h7725] them from their evil[^h7451] way[^h1870], and from the evil[^h7455] of their doings[^h4611].
###### 23
Am I a God[^h430] at hand[^h7138], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and not a God[^h430] afar off[^h7350]?
###### 24
Can any[^h376] hide[^h5641] himself in secret places[^h4565] that I shall not see[^h7200] him? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. Do not I fill[^h4392] heaven[^h8064] and earth[^h776]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 25
I have heard[^h8085] what the prophets[^h5030] said[^h559], that prophesy[^h5012] lies[^h8267] in my name[^h8034], saying[^h559], I have dreamed[^h2492], I have dreamed[^h2492].
###### 26
How long shall this be[^h3426] in the heart[^h3820] of the prophets[^h5030] that prophesy[^h5012] lies[^h8267]? yea, they are prophets[^h5030] of the deceit[^h8649] of their own heart[^h3820];
###### 27
Which think[^h2803] to cause my people[^h5971] to forget[^h7911] my name[^h8034] by their dreams[^h2472] which they tell[^h5608] every man[^h376] to his neighbour[^h7453], as their fathers[^h1] have forgotten[^h7911] my name[^h8034] for Baal[^h1168].
###### 28
The prophet[^h5030] that hath a dream[^h2472], let him tell[^h5608] a dream[^h2472]; and he that hath my word[^h1697], let him speak[^h1696] my word[^h1697] faithfully[^h571]. What is the chaff[^h8401] to the wheat[^h1250]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 29
Is not my word[^h1697] like[^h3541] as a fire[^h784]? saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; and like a hammer[^h6360] that breaketh[^h6327] the rock[^h5553] in pieces[^h6327]?
###### 30
Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets[^h5030], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that steal[^h1589] my words[^h1697] every one[^h376] from his neighbour[^h7453].
###### 31
Behold, I am against the prophets[^h5030], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], that use[^h3947] their tongues[^h3956], and say[^h5001], He saith[^h5002]. 
###### 32
Behold, I am against them that prophesy[^h5012] false[^h8267] dreams[^h2472], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and do tell[^h5608] them, and cause my people[^h5971] to err[^h8582] by their lies[^h8267], and by their lightness[^h6350]; yet I sent[^h7971] them not, nor commanded[^h6680] them: therefore they shall not profit[^h3276] this people[^h5971] at all[^h3276], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 33
And when this people[^h5971], or the prophet[^h5030], or a priest[^h3548], shall ask[^h7592] thee, saying[^h559], What is the burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068]? thou shalt then say[^h559] unto them, What burden[^h4853]? I will even forsake[^h5203] you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 34
And as for the prophet[^h5030], and the priest[^h3548], and the people[^h5971], that shall say[^h559], The burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068], I will even punish[^h6485] that man[^h376] and his house[^h1004]. 
###### 35
Thus shall ye say[^h559] every one[^h376] to his neighbour[^h7453], and every one[^h376] to his brother[^h251], What hath the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030]? and, What hath the LORD[^h3068] spoken[^h1696]?
###### 36
And the burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068] shall ye mention[^h2142] no more: for every man's[^h376] word[^h1697] shall be his burden[^h4853]; for ye have perverted[^h2015] the words[^h1697] of the living[^h2416] God[^h430], of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] our God[^h430].
###### 37
Thus shalt thou say[^h559] to the prophet[^h5030], What hath the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] thee? and, What hath the LORD[^h3068] spoken[^h1696]?
###### 38
But[^h518] since ye say[^h559], The burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068]; therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Because ye say[^h559] this word[^h1697], The burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068], and I have sent[^h7971] unto you, saying[^h559], Ye shall not say[^h559], The burden[^h4853] of the LORD[^h3068];
###### 39
Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly[^h5377] forget[^h5382] you, and I will forsake[^h5203] you, and the city[^h5892] that I gave[^h5414] you and your fathers[^h1], and cast you out of my presence[^h6440]:
###### 40
And I will bring[^h5414] an everlasting[^h5769] reproach[^h2781] upon you, and a perpetual[^h5769] shame[^h3640], which shall not be forgotten[^h7911].

###### 1
In the beginning[^h7225] of the reign[^h4467] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] the son[^h1121] of Josiah[^h2977] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] came this word[^h1697] unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] to me; Make[^h6213] thee bonds[^h4147] and yokes[^h4133], and put[^h5414] them upon thy neck[^h6677], 
###### 3
And send[^h7971] them to the king[^h4428] of Edom[^h123], and to the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], and to the king[^h4428] of the Ammonites[^h1121] [^h5983], and to the king[^h4428] of Tyrus[^h6865], and to the king[^h4428] of Zidon[^h6721], by the hand[^h3027] of the messengers[^h4397] which come[^h935] to Jerusalem[^h3389] unto Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063];
###### 4
And command[^h6680] them to say[^h559] unto their masters[^h113], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Thus shall ye say[^h559] unto your masters[^h113]; 
###### 5
I have made[^h6213] the earth[^h776], the man[^h120] and the beast[^h929] that are upon[^h6440] the ground[^h776], by my great[^h1419] power[^h3581] and by my outstretched[^h5186] arm[^h2220], and have given[^h5414] it unto whom it seemed[^h5869] meet[^h3474] unto me.
###### 6
And now have I given[^h5414] all these lands[^h776] into the hand[^h3027] of Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], my servant[^h5650]; and the beasts[^h2416] of the field[^h7704] have I given[^h5414] him also to serve[^h5647] him.
###### 7
And all nations[^h1471] shall serve[^h5647] him, and his son[^h1121], and his son's[^h1121] son[^h1121], until the very time[^h6256] of his land[^h776] come[^h935]: and then many[^h7227] nations[^h1471] and great[^h1419] kings[^h4428] shall serve[^h5647] themselves of him.
###### 8
And it shall come to pass, that the nation[^h1471] and kingdom[^h4467] which will not serve[^h5647] the same Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and that will not put[^h5414] their neck[^h6677] under the yoke[^h5923] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], that nation[^h1471] will I punish[^h6485], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], with the sword[^h2719], and with the famine[^h7458], and with the pestilence[^h1698], until I have consumed[^h8552] them by his hand[^h3027].
###### 9
Therefore hearken[^h8085] not ye to your prophets[^h5030], nor to your diviners[^h7080], nor to your dreamers[^h2472], nor to your enchanters[^h6049], nor to your sorcerers[^h3786], which speak[^h559] unto you, saying[^h559], Ye shall not serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]: 
###### 10
For they prophesy[^h5012] a lie[^h8267] unto you, to remove you far[^h7368] from your land[^h127]; and that I should drive you out[^h5080], and ye should perish[^h6].
###### 11
But the nations[^h1471] that bring[^h935] their neck[^h6677] under the yoke[^h5923] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and serve[^h5647] him, those will I let remain still[^h3240] in their own land[^h127], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; and they shall till[^h5647] it, and dwell[^h3427] therein.
###### 12
I spake[^h1696] also to Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] according to all these words[^h1697], saying[^h559], Bring[^h935] your necks[^h6677] under the yoke[^h5923] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and serve[^h5647] him and his people[^h5971], and live[^h2421].
###### 13
Why will ye die[^h4191], thou and thy people[^h5971], by the sword[^h2719], by the famine[^h7458], and by the pestilence[^h1698], as the LORD[^h3068] hath spoken[^h1696] against the nation[^h1471] that will not serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]?
###### 14
Therefore hearken[^h8085] not unto the words[^h1697] of the prophets[^h5030] that speak[^h559] unto you, saying[^h559], Ye shall not serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]: for they prophesy[^h5012] a lie[^h8267] unto you.
###### 15
For I have not sent[^h7971] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], yet they prophesy[^h5012] a lie[^h8267] in my name[^h8034]; that I might drive you out[^h5080], and that ye might perish[^h6], ye, and the prophets[^h5030] that prophesy[^h5012] unto you. 
###### 16
Also I spake[^h1696] to the priests[^h3548] and to all this people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Hearken[^h8085] not to the words[^h1697] of your prophets[^h5030] that prophesy[^h5012] unto you, saying[^h559], Behold, the vessels[^h3627] of the LORD'S[^h3068] house[^h1004] shall now shortly[^h4120] be brought again[^h7725] from Babylon[^h894]: for they prophesy[^h5012] a lie[^h8267] unto you.
###### 17
Hearken[^h8085] not unto them; serve[^h5647] the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and live[^h2421]: wherefore should this city[^h5892] be laid waste[^h2723]?
###### 18
But if they be prophets[^h5030], and if the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] be[^h3426] with them, let them now make intercession[^h6293] to the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], that the vessels[^h3627] which are left[^h3498] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and at Jerusalem[^h3389], go[^h935] not to Babylon[^h894].
###### 19
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] concerning the pillars[^h5982], and concerning the sea[^h3220], and concerning the bases[^h4350], and concerning the residue[^h3499] of the vessels[^h3627] that remain[^h3498] in this city[^h5892],
###### 20
Which Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] took[^h3947] not, when he carried away captive[^h1540] Jeconiah[^h3204] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] from Jerusalem[^h3389] to Babylon[^h894], and all the nobles[^h2715] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389];
###### 21
Yea, thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], concerning the vessels[^h3627] that remain[^h3498] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], and in the house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and of Jerusalem[^h3389];
###### 22
They shall be carried[^h935] to Babylon[^h894], and there shall they be until the day[^h3117] that I visit[^h6485] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; then will I bring[^h5927] them up, and restore[^h7725] them to this place[^h4725].

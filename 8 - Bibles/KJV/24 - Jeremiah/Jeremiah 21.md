###### 1
The word[^h1697] which came unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], when king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667] sent[^h7971] unto him Pashur[^h6583] the son[^h1121] of Melchiah[^h4441], and Zephaniah[^h6846] the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4641] the priest[^h3548], saying[^h559],
###### 2
Enquire[^h1875], I pray thee, of the LORD[^h3068] for us[^h1157]; for Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] maketh war[^h3898] against us; if so be that the LORD[^h3068] will deal[^h6213] with us according to all his wondrous works[^h6381], that he may go up[^h5927] from us.
###### 3
Then said[^h559] Jeremiah[^h3414] unto them, Thus shall ye say[^h559] to Zedekiah[^h6667]:
###### 4
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Behold, I will turn back[^h5437] the weapons[^h3627] of war[^h4421] that are in your hands[^h3027], wherewith ye fight[^h3898] against the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and against the Chaldeans[^h3778], which besiege[^h6696] you without[^h2351] the walls[^h2346], and I will assemble[^h622] them into the midst[^h8432] of this city[^h5892].
###### 5
And I myself will fight[^h3898] against you with an outstretched[^h5186] hand[^h3027] and with a strong[^h2389] arm[^h2220], even in anger[^h639], and in fury[^h2534], and in great[^h1419] wrath[^h7110].
###### 6
And I will smite[^h5221] the inhabitants[^h3427] of this city[^h5892], both man[^h120] and beast[^h929]: they shall die[^h4191] of a great[^h1419] pestilence[^h1698].
###### 7
And afterward[^h310], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], I will deliver[^h5414] Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and his servants[^h5650], and the people[^h5971], and such as are left[^h7604] in this city[^h5892] from the pestilence[^h1698], from the sword[^h2719], and from the famine[^h7458], into the hand[^h3027] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341], and into the hand[^h3027] of those that seek[^h1245] their life[^h5315]: and he shall smite[^h5221] them with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719]; he shall not spare[^h2347] them, neither have pity[^h2550], nor have mercy[^h7355].
###### 8
And unto this people[^h5971] thou shalt say[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I set[^h5414] before[^h6440] you the way[^h1870] of life[^h2416], and the way[^h1870] of death[^h4194].
###### 9
He that abideth[^h3427] in this city[^h5892] shall die[^h4191] by the sword[^h2719], and by the famine[^h7458], and by the pestilence[^h1698]: but he that goeth out[^h3318], and falleth[^h5307] to the Chaldeans[^h3778] that besiege[^h6696] you, he shall live[^h2421] [^h2421], and his life[^h5315] shall be unto him for a prey[^h7998].
###### 10
For I have set[^h7760] my face[^h6440] against this city[^h5892] for evil[^h7451], and not for good[^h2896], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: it shall be given[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784].
###### 11
And touching the house[^h1004] of the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], say, Hear[^h8085] ye the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068];
###### 12
O house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Execute[^h1777] judgment[^h4941] in the morning[^h1242], and deliver[^h5337] him that is spoiled[^h1497] out of the hand[^h3027] of the oppressor[^h6231], lest my fury[^h2534] go out[^h3318] like fire[^h784], and burn[^h1197] that none can quench[^h3518] it, because[^h6440] of the evil[^h7455] of your doings[^h4611]. 
###### 13
Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant[^h3427] of the valley[^h6010], and rock[^h6697] of the plain[^h4334], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; which say[^h559], Who shall come down[^h5181] against us? or who shall enter[^h935] into our habitations[^h4585]? 
###### 14
But I will punish[^h6485] you according to the fruit[^h6529] of your doings[^h4611], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: and I will kindle[^h3341] a fire[^h784] in the forest[^h3293] thereof, and it shall devour[^h398] all things round about[^h5439] it.

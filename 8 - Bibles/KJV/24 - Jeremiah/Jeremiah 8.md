###### 1
At that time[^h6256], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], they shall bring out[^h3318] the bones[^h6106] of the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and the bones[^h6106] of his princes[^h8269], and the bones[^h6106] of the priests[^h3548], and the bones[^h6106] of the prophets[^h5030], and the bones[^h6106] of the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], out of their graves[^h6913]:
###### 2
And they shall spread[^h7849] them before the sun[^h8121], and the moon[^h3394], and all the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064], whom they have loved[^h157], and whom they have served[^h5647], and after[^h310] whom they have walked[^h1980], and whom they have sought[^h1875], and whom they have worshipped[^h7812]: they shall not be gathered[^h622], nor be buried[^h6912]; they shall be for dung[^h1828] upon the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127].
###### 3
And death[^h4194] shall be chosen[^h977] rather than life[^h2416] by all the residue[^h7611] of them that remain[^h7604] of this evil[^h7451] family[^h4940], which remain[^h7604] in all the places[^h4725] whither I have driven[^h5080] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 4
Moreover thou shalt say[^h559] unto them, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Shall they fall[^h5307], and not arise[^h6965]? shall he turn away[^h7725], and not return[^h7725]?
###### 5
Why then is this people[^h5971] of Jerusalem[^h3389] slidden back[^h7725] by a perpetual[^h5329] backsliding[^h4878]? they hold[^h2388] fast deceit[^h8649], they refuse[^h3985] to return[^h7725].
###### 6
I hearkened[^h7181] and heard[^h8085], but they spake not aright[^h1696]: no man[^h376] repented[^h5162] him of[^h5921] his wickedness[^h7451], saying[^h559], What have I done[^h6213]? every one turned[^h7725] to his course[^h4794], as the horse[^h5483] rusheth[^h7857] into the battle[^h4421].
###### 7
Yea, the stork[^h2624] in the heaven[^h8064] knoweth[^h3045] her appointed times[^h4150]; and the turtle[^h8449] and the crane[^h5483] and the swallow[^h5693] observe[^h8104] the time[^h6256] of their coming[^h935]; but my people[^h5971] know[^h3045] not the judgment[^h4941] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 8
How do ye say[^h559], We are wise[^h2450], and the law[^h8451] of the LORD[^h3068] is with us? Lo, certainly[^h403] in vain[^h8267] made[^h6213] he it; the pen[^h5842] of the scribes[^h5608] is in vain[^h8267]. 
###### 9
The wise[^h2450] men are ashamed[^h3001], they are dismayed[^h2865] and taken[^h3920]: lo, they have rejected[^h3988] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068]; and what wisdom[^h2451] is in them?  
###### 10
Therefore will I give[^h5414] their wives[^h802] unto others[^h312], and their fields[^h7704] to them that shall inherit[^h3423] them: for every one from the least[^h6996] even unto the greatest[^h1419] is given[^h1214] to covetousness[^h1215], from the prophet[^h5030] even unto the priest[^h3548] every one dealeth[^h6213] falsely[^h8267].
###### 11
For they have healed[^h7495] the hurt[^h7667] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] slightly[^h7043], saying[^h559], Peace[^h7965], peace[^h7965]; when there is no peace[^h7965].
###### 12
Were they ashamed[^h3001] when they had committed[^h6213] abomination[^h8441]? nay, they were not at all[^h954] ashamed[^h954], neither could[^h3045] they blush[^h3637]: therefore shall they fall[^h5307] among them that fall[^h5307]: in the time[^h6256] of their visitation[^h6486] they shall be cast down[^h3782], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 13
I will surely[^h622] consume[^h5486] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: there shall be no grapes[^h6025] on the vine[^h1612], nor figs[^h8384] on the fig tree[^h8384], and the leaf[^h5929] shall fade[^h5034]; and the things that I have given[^h5414] them shall pass away[^h5674] from them.
###### 14
Why do we sit still[^h3427]? assemble[^h622] yourselves, and let us enter[^h935] into the defenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892], and let us be silent[^h1826] there: for the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] hath put us to silence[^h1826], and given us water[^h4325] of gall[^h7219] to drink[^h8248], because we have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 15
We looked[^h6960] for peace[^h7965], but no good[^h2896] came; and for a time[^h6256] of health[^h4832], and behold trouble[^h1205]!
###### 16
The snorting[^h5170] of his horses[^h5483] was heard[^h8085] from Dan[^h1835]: the whole land[^h776] trembled[^h7493] at the sound[^h6963] of the neighing[^h4684] of his strong ones[^h47]; for they are come[^h935], and have devoured[^h398] the land[^h776], and all[^h4393] that is in it; the city[^h5892], and those that dwell[^h3427] therein. 
###### 17
For, behold, I will send[^h7971] serpents[^h5175], cockatrices[^h6848], among you, which will not be charmed[^h3908], and they shall bite[^h5391] you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
When I would comfort[^h4010] myself against sorrow[^h3015], my heart[^h3820] is faint[^h1742] in me. 
###### 19
Behold the voice[^h6963] of the cry[^h7775] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] because of them that dwell in a far[^h4801] country[^h776]: Is not the LORD[^h3068] in Zion[^h6726]? is not her king[^h4428] in her? Why have they provoked me to anger[^h3707] with their graven images[^h6456], and with strange[^h5236] vanities[^h1892]? 
###### 20
The harvest[^h7105] is past[^h5674], the summer[^h7019] is ended[^h3615], and we are not saved[^h3467].
###### 21
For the hurt[^h7667] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] am I hurt[^h7665]; I am black[^h6937]; astonishment[^h8047] hath taken hold[^h2388] on me.
###### 22
Is there no balm[^h6875] in Gilead[^h1568]; is there no physician[^h7495] there? why then[^h3588] is not the health[^h724] of the daughter[^h1323] of my people[^h5971] recovered[^h5927]?

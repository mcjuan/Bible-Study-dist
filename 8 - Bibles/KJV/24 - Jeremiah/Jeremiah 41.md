###### 1
Now it came to pass in the seventh[^h7637] month[^h2320], that Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] the son[^h1121] of Elishama[^h476], of the seed[^h2233] royal[^h4410], and the princes[^h7227] of the king[^h4428], even ten[^h6235] men[^h582] with him, came[^h935] unto Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] to Mizpah[^h4709]; and there they did eat[^h398] bread[^h3899] together[^h3162] in Mizpah[^h4708].
###### 2
Then arose[^h6965] Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], and the ten[^h6235] men[^h582] that were with him, and smote[^h5221] Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227] with the sword[^h2719], and slew[^h4191] him, whom the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had made governor[^h6485] over the land[^h776].
###### 3
Ishmael[^h3458] also slew[^h5221] all the Jews[^h3064] that were with him, even with Gedaliah[^h1436], at Mizpah[^h4709], and the Chaldeans[^h3778] that were found[^h4672] there, and the men[^h582] of war[^h4421].
###### 4
And it came to pass the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] after he had slain[^h4191] Gedaliah[^h1436], and no man[^h376] knew[^h3045] it,
###### 5
That there came[^h935] certain[^h582] from Shechem[^h7927], from Shiloh[^h7887], and from Samaria[^h8111], even fourscore[^h8084] men[^h376], having their beards[^h2206] shaven[^h1548], and their clothes[^h899] rent[^h7167], and having cut[^h1413] themselves, with offerings[^h4503] and incense[^h3828] in their hand[^h3027], to bring[^h935] them to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] went forth[^h3318] from Mizpah[^h4709] to meet[^h7125] them, weeping[^h1058] all along[^h1980] as he went[^h1980]: and it came to pass, as he met[^h6298] them, he said[^h559] unto them, Come[^h935] to Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296]. 
###### 7
And it was so, when they came[^h935] into the midst[^h8432] of the city[^h5892], that Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] slew[^h7819] them, and cast them into the midst[^h8432] of the pit[^h953], he, and the men[^h582] that were with him.
###### 8
But ten[^h6235] men[^h582] were found[^h4672] among them that said[^h559] unto Ishmael[^h3458], Slay[^h4191] us not: for we have[^h3426] treasures[^h4301] in the field[^h7704], of wheat[^h2406], and of barley[^h8184], and of oil[^h8081], and of honey[^h1706]. So he forbare[^h2308], and slew[^h4191] them not among[^h8432] their brethren[^h251].
###### 9
Now the pit[^h953] wherein Ishmael[^h3458] had cast[^h7993] all the dead bodies[^h6297] of the men[^h582], whom he had slain[^h5221] because[^h3027] of Gedaliah[^h1436], was it which Asa[^h609] the king[^h4428] had made[^h6213] for fear[^h6440] of Baasha[^h1201] king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478]: and Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] filled[^h4390] it with them that were slain[^h2491]. 
###### 10
Then Ishmael[^h3458] carried away captive[^h7617] all the residue[^h7611] of the people[^h5971] that were in Mizpah[^h4709], even the king's[^h4428] daughters[^h1323], and all the people[^h5971] that remained[^h7604] in Mizpah[^h4709], whom Nebuzaradan[^h5018] the captain[^h7227] of the guard[^h2876] had committed[^h6485] to Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296]: and Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] carried them away captive[^h7617], and departed[^h3212] to go over[^h5674] to the Ammonites[^h1121] [^h5983].
###### 11
But when Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428] that were with him, heard[^h8085] of all the evil[^h7451] that Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] had done[^h6213],
###### 12
Then they took[^h3947] all the men[^h582], and went[^h3212] to fight[^h3898] with Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], and found[^h4672] him by the great[^h7227] waters[^h4325] that are in Gibeon[^h1391].
###### 13
Now it came to pass, that when all the people[^h5971] which were with Ishmael[^h3458] saw[^h7200] Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428] that were with him, then they were glad[^h8055].
###### 14
So all the people[^h5971] that Ishmael[^h3458] had carried away captive[^h7617] from Mizpah[^h4709] cast about[^h5437] and returned[^h7725], and went[^h3212] unto Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143].
###### 15
But Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] escaped[^h4422] from[^h6440] Johanan[^h3110] with eight[^h8083] men[^h582], and went[^h3212] to the Ammonites[^h1121] [^h5983].
###### 16
Then took[^h3947] Johanan[^h3110] the son[^h1121] of Kareah[^h7143], and all the captains[^h8269] of the forces[^h2428] that were with him, all the remnant[^h7611] of the people[^h5971] whom he had recovered[^h7725] from Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418], from Mizpah[^h4709], after[^h310] that he had slain[^h5221] Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296], even mighty[^h1397] men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and the women[^h802], and the children[^h2945], and the eunuchs[^h5631], whom he had brought again[^h7725] from Gibeon[^h1391]:
###### 17
And they departed[^h3212], and dwelt in[^h3427] the habitation[^h1628] of Chimham[^h3643], which is by[^h681] Bethlehem[^h1035], to go[^h3212] to enter[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714],
###### 18
Because[^h6440] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]: for they were afraid[^h3372] of them, because Ishmael[^h3458] the son[^h1121] of Nethaniah[^h5418] had slain[^h5221] Gedaliah[^h1436] the son[^h1121] of Ahikam[^h296], whom the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] made governor[^h6485] in the land[^h776].

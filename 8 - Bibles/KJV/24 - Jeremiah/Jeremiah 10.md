###### 1
Hear[^h8085] ye the word[^h1697] which the LORD[^h3068] speaketh[^h1696] unto you, O house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478]:
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Learn[^h3925] not the way[^h1870] of the heathen[^h1471], and be not dismayed[^h2865] at the signs[^h226] of heaven[^h8064]; for the heathen[^h1471] are dismayed[^h2865] at them[^h1992].
###### 3
For the customs[^h2708] of the people[^h5971] are vain[^h1892]: for one cutteth[^h3772] a tree[^h6086] out of the forest[^h3293], the work[^h4639] of the hands[^h3027] of the workman[^h2796], with the axe[^h4621]. 
###### 4
They deck[^h3302] it with silver[^h3701] and with gold[^h2091]; they fasten[^h2388] it with nails[^h4548] and with hammers[^h4717], that it move[^h6328] not.
###### 5
They are upright[^h4749] as the palm tree[^h8560], but speak[^h1696] not: they must needs[^h5375] be borne[^h5375], because they cannot go[^h6805]. Be not afraid[^h3372] of them; for they cannot do evil[^h7489], neither also is it in them to do good[^h3190].
###### 6
Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD[^h3068]; thou art great[^h1419], and thy name[^h8034] is great[^h1419] in might[^h1369].
###### 7
Who would not fear[^h3372] thee, O King[^h4428] of nations[^h1471]? for to thee doth it appertain[^h2969]: forasmuch as among all the wise[^h2450] men of the nations[^h1471], and in all their kingdoms[^h4438], there is none like unto thee. 
###### 8
But they are altogether[^h259] brutish[^h1197] and foolish[^h3688]: the stock[^h6086] is a doctrine[^h4148] of vanities[^h1892]. 
###### 9
Silver[^h3701] spread into plates[^h7554] is brought[^h935] from Tarshish[^h8659], and gold[^h2091] from Uphaz[^h210], the work[^h4639] of the workman[^h2796], and of the hands[^h3027] of the founder[^h6884]: blue[^h8504] and purple[^h713] is their clothing[^h3830]: they are all the work[^h4639] of cunning[^h2450] men.
###### 10
But the LORD[^h3068] is the true[^h571] God[^h430], he is the living[^h2416] God[^h430], and an everlasting[^h5769] king[^h4428]: at his wrath[^h7110] the earth[^h776] shall tremble[^h7493], and the nations[^h1471] shall not be able to abide[^h3557] his indignation[^h2195].  
###### 11
Thus[^h1836] shall ye say[^h560] unto them, The gods[^h426] that have not[^h3809] made[^h5648] the heavens[^h8065] and the earth[^h778], even they shall perish[^h7] from the earth[^h772], and from under[^h8460] these[^h429] heavens[^h8065].
###### 12
He hath made[^h6213] the earth[^h776] by his power[^h3581], he hath established[^h3559] the world[^h8398] by his wisdom[^h2451], and hath stretched out[^h5186] the heavens[^h8064] by his discretion[^h8394].
###### 13
When he uttereth[^h5414] his voice[^h6963], there is a multitude[^h1995] of waters[^h4325] in the heavens[^h8064], and he causeth the vapours[^h5387] to ascend[^h5927] from the ends[^h7097] of the earth[^h776]; he maketh[^h6213] lightnings[^h1300] with rain[^h4306], and bringeth forth[^h3318] the wind[^h7307] out of his treasures[^h214].  
###### 14
Every man[^h120] is brutish[^h1197] in his knowledge[^h1847]: every founder[^h6884] is confounded[^h3001] by the graven image[^h6459]: for his molten image[^h5262] is falsehood[^h8267], and there is no breath[^h7307] in them. 
###### 15
They are vanity[^h1892], and the work[^h4639] of errors[^h8595]: in the time[^h6256] of their visitation[^h6486] they shall perish[^h6].
###### 16
The portion[^h2506] of Jacob[^h3290] is not like them: for he is the former[^h3335] of all things; and Israel[^h3478] is the rod[^h7626] of his inheritance[^h5159]: The LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] is his name[^h8034].
###### 17
Gather up[^h622] thy wares[^h3666] out of the land[^h776], O inhabitant[^h3427] of the fortress[^h4692]. 
###### 18
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Behold, I will sling[^h7049] out the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776] at this once[^h6471], and will distress[^h6887] them, that they may find[^h4672] it so.
###### 19
Woe[^h188] is me for my hurt[^h7667]! my wound[^h4347] is grievous[^h2470]: but I said[^h559], Truly[^h389] this is a grief[^h2483], and I must bear[^h5375] it.
###### 20
My tabernacle[^h168] is spoiled[^h7703], and all my cords[^h4340] are broken[^h5423]: my children[^h1121] are gone forth[^h3318] of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth[^h5186] my tent[^h168] any more, and to set up[^h6965] my curtains[^h3407].
###### 21
For the pastors[^h7462] are become brutish[^h1197], and have not sought[^h1875] the LORD[^h3068]: therefore they shall not prosper[^h7919], and all their flocks[^h4830] shall be scattered[^h6327].
###### 22
Behold, the noise[^h6963] of the bruit[^h8052] is come[^h935], and a great[^h1419] commotion[^h7494] out of the north[^h6828] country[^h776], to make[^h7760] the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] desolate[^h8077], and a den[^h4583] of dragons[^h8577].
###### 23
O LORD[^h3068], I know[^h3045] that the way[^h1870] of man[^h120] is not in himself: it is not in man[^h376] that walketh[^h1980] to direct[^h3559] his steps[^h6806].
###### 24
O LORD[^h3068], correct[^h3256] me, but with judgment[^h4941]; not in thine anger[^h639], lest thou bring me to nothing[^h4591]. 
###### 25
Pour out[^h8210] thy fury[^h2534] upon the heathen[^h1471] that know[^h3045] thee not, and upon the families[^h4940] that call[^h7121] not on thy name[^h8034]: for they have eaten up[^h398] Jacob[^h3290], and devoured[^h398] him, and consumed[^h3615] him, and have made his habitation[^h5116] desolate[^h8074].

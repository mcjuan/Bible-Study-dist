###### 1
Now these are the words[^h1697] of the letter[^h5612] that Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] sent[^h7971] from Jerusalem[^h3389] unto the residue[^h3499] of the elders[^h2205] which were carried away captives[^h1473], and to the priests[^h3548], and to the prophets[^h5030], and to all the people[^h5971] whom Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] had carried away captive[^h1540] from Jerusalem[^h3389] to Babylon[^h894];
###### 2
(After[^h310] that Jeconiah[^h3204] the king[^h4428], and the queen[^h1377], and the eunuchs[^h5631], the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389], and the carpenters[^h2796], and the smiths[^h4525], were departed[^h3318] from Jerusalem[^h3389];) 
###### 3
By the hand[^h3027] of Elasah[^h501] the son[^h1121] of Shaphan[^h8227], and Gemariah[^h1587] the son[^h1121] of Hilkiah[^h2518], (whom Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] sent[^h7971] unto Babylon[^h894] to Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]) saying[^h559],
###### 4
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], unto all that are carried away captives[^h1473], whom I have caused to be carried away[^h1540] from Jerusalem[^h3389] unto Babylon[^h894];
###### 5
Build[^h1129] ye houses[^h1004], and dwell[^h3427] in them; and plant[^h5193] gardens[^h1593], and eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] of them;
###### 6
Take[^h3947] ye wives[^h802], and beget[^h3205] sons[^h1121] and daughters[^h1323]; and take[^h3947] wives[^h802] for your sons[^h1121], and give[^h5414] your daughters[^h1323] to husbands[^h582], that they may bear[^h3205] sons[^h1121] and daughters[^h1121]; that ye may be increased[^h7235] there, and not diminished[^h4591].
###### 7
And seek[^h1875] the peace[^h7965] of the city[^h5892] whither I have caused you to be carried away captives[^h1540], and pray[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068] for it: for in the peace[^h7965] thereof shall ye have peace[^h7965].
###### 8
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Let not your prophets[^h5030] and your diviners[^h7080], that be in the midst[^h7130] of you, deceive[^h5377] you, neither hearken[^h8085] to your dreams[^h2472] which ye cause to be dreamed[^h2492].
###### 9
For they prophesy[^h5012] falsely[^h8267] unto you in my name[^h8034]: I have not sent[^h7971] them, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 10
For thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], That after[^h6310] seventy[^h7657] years[^h8141] be accomplished[^h4390] at Babylon[^h894] I will visit[^h6485] you, and perform[^h6965] my good[^h2896] word[^h1697] toward you, in causing you to return[^h7725] to this place[^h4725].
###### 11
For I know[^h3045] the thoughts[^h4284] that I think[^h2803] toward you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], thoughts[^h4284] of peace[^h7965], and not of evil[^h7451], to give[^h5414] you an expected[^h8615] end[^h319]. 
###### 12
Then shall ye call[^h7121] upon me, and ye shall go[^h1980] and pray[^h6419] unto me, and I will hearken[^h8085] unto you.
###### 13
And ye shall seek[^h1245] me, and find[^h4672] me, when ye shall search[^h1875] for me with all your heart[^h3824].
###### 14
And I will be found[^h4672] of you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]: and I will turn away[^h7725] your captivity[^h7622] [^h7622], and I will gather[^h6908] you from all the nations[^h1471], and from all the places[^h4725] whither I have driven[^h5080] you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; and I will bring you again[^h7725] into the place[^h4725] whence I caused you to be carried away captive[^h1540].
###### 15
Because ye have said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] hath raised us up[^h6965] prophets[^h5030] in Babylon[^h894];
###### 16
Know that thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of the king[^h4428] that sitteth[^h3427] upon the throne[^h3678] of David[^h1732], and of all the people[^h5971] that dwelleth[^h3427] in this city[^h5892], and of your brethren[^h251] that are not gone forth[^h3318] with you into captivity[^h1473];
###### 17
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]; Behold, I will send[^h7971] upon them the sword[^h2719], the famine[^h7458], and the pestilence[^h1698], and will make[^h5414] them like vile[^h8182] figs[^h8384], that cannot be eaten[^h398], they are so evil[^h7455].
###### 18
And I will persecute[^h7291] them[^h310] with the sword[^h2719], with the famine[^h7458], and with the pestilence[^h1698], and will deliver[^h5414] them to be removed[^h2189] [^h2113] to all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776], to be a curse[^h423], and an astonishment[^h8047], and an hissing[^h8322], and a reproach[^h2781], among all the nations[^h1471] whither I have driven[^h5080] them: 
###### 19
Because they have not hearkened[^h8085] to my words[^h1697], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], which I sent[^h7971] unto them by my servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], rising up early[^h7925] and sending[^h7971] them; but ye would not hear[^h8085], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 20
Hear[^h8085] ye therefore the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], all ye of the captivity[^h1473], whom I have sent[^h7971] from Jerusalem[^h3389] to Babylon[^h894]:
###### 21
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], of Ahab[^h256] the son[^h1121] of Kolaiah[^h6964], and of Zedekiah[^h6667] the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4641], which prophesy[^h5012] a lie[^h8267] unto you in my name[^h8034]; Behold, I will deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894]; and he shall slay[^h5221] them before your eyes[^h5869];
###### 22
And of them shall be taken up[^h3947] a curse[^h7045] by all the captivity[^h1546] of Judah[^h3063] which are in Babylon[^h894], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] make[^h7760] thee like Zedekiah[^h6667] and like Ahab[^h256], whom the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] roasted[^h7033] in the fire[^h784];
###### 23
Because they have committed[^h6213] villany[^h5039] in Israel[^h3478], and have committed[^h6213] adultery[^h5003] with their neighbours'[^h7453] wives[^h802], and have spoken[^h1696] lying[^h8267] words[^h1697] in my name[^h8034], which I have not commanded[^h6680] them; even I know[^h3045], and am a witness[^h5707], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 24
Thus shalt thou also speak[^h559] to Shemaiah[^h8098] the Nehelamite[^h5161], saying[^h559], 
###### 25
Thus speaketh[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], Because thou hast sent[^h7971] letters[^h5612] in thy name[^h8034] unto all the people[^h5971] that are at Jerusalem[^h3389], and to Zephaniah[^h6846] the son[^h1121] of Maaseiah[^h4641] the priest[^h3548], and to all the priests[^h3548], saying[^h559],
###### 26
The LORD[^h3068] hath made[^h5414] thee priest[^h3548] in the stead of Jehoiada[^h3077] the priest[^h3548], that ye should be officers[^h6496] in the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], for every man[^h376] that is mad[^h7696], and maketh himself a prophet[^h5012], that thou shouldest put[^h5414] him in prison[^h4115], and in the stocks[^h6729].
###### 27
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved[^h1605] Jeremiah[^h3414] of Anathoth[^h6069], which maketh himself a prophet[^h5012] to you?
###### 28
For therefore he sent[^h7971] unto us in Babylon[^h894], saying[^h559], This[^h1931] captivity is long[^h752]: build[^h1129] ye houses[^h1004], and dwell[^h3427] in them; and plant[^h5193] gardens[^h1593], and eat[^h398] the fruit[^h6529] of them.
###### 29
And Zephaniah[^h6846] the priest[^h3548] read[^h7121] this letter[^h5612] in the ears[^h241] of Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030].
###### 30
Then came the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto Jeremiah[^h3414], saying[^h559],
###### 31
Send[^h7971] to all them of the captivity[^h1473], saying[^h559], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] concerning Shemaiah[^h8098] the Nehelamite[^h5161]; Because that Shemaiah[^h8098] hath prophesied[^h5012] unto you, and I sent[^h7971] him not, and he caused you to trust[^h982] in a lie[^h8267]:
###### 32
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will punish[^h6485] Shemaiah[^h8098] the Nehelamite[^h5161], and his seed[^h2233]: he shall not have a man[^h376] to dwell[^h3427] among[^h8432] this people[^h5971]; neither shall he behold[^h7200] the good[^h2896] that I will do[^h6213] for my people[^h5971], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068]; because he hath taught[^h1696] rebellion[^h5627] against the LORD[^h3068].

###### 1
The LORD[^h3068] shewed[^h7200] me, and, behold, two[^h8147] baskets[^h1736] of figs[^h8384] were set[^h3259] before[^h6440] the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], after[^h310] that Nebuchadrezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] had carried away captive[^h1540] Jeconiah[^h3204] the son[^h1121] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and the princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063], with the carpenters[^h2796] and smiths[^h4525], from Jerusalem[^h3389], and had brought[^h935] them to Babylon[^h894].
###### 2
One[^h259] basket[^h1731] had very[^h3966] good[^h2896] figs[^h8384], even like the figs[^h8384] that are first ripe[^h1073]: and the other[^h259] basket[^h1731] had very[^h3966] naughty[^h7451] figs[^h8384], which could not be eaten[^h398], they were so bad[^h7455]. 
###### 3
Then said[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] unto me, What seest[^h7200] thou, Jeremiah[^h3414]? And I said[^h559], Figs[^h8384]; the good[^h2896] figs[^h8384], very[^h3966] good[^h2896]; and the evil[^h7451], very[^h3966] evil[^h7451], that cannot be eaten[^h398], they are so evil[^h7455].
###### 4
Again the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came unto me, saying[^h559],
###### 5
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Like these good[^h2896] figs[^h8384], so will I acknowledge[^h5234] them that are carried away captive[^h1546] of Judah[^h3063], whom I have sent[^h7971] out of this place[^h4725] into the land[^h776] of the Chaldeans[^h3778] for their good[^h2896]. 
###### 6
For I will set[^h7760] mine eyes[^h5869] upon them for good[^h2896], and I will bring them again[^h7725] to this land[^h776]: and I will build[^h1129] them, and not pull them down[^h2040]; and I will plant[^h5193] them, and not pluck them up[^h5428].
###### 7
And I will give[^h5414] them an heart[^h3820] to know[^h3045] me, that I am the LORD[^h3068]: and they shall be my people[^h5971], and I will be their God[^h430]: for they shall return[^h7725] unto me with their whole heart[^h3820].
###### 8
And as the evil[^h7451] figs[^h8384], which cannot be eaten[^h398], they are so evil[^h7455]; surely thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], So will I give[^h5414] Zedekiah[^h6667] the king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and his princes[^h8269], and the residue[^h7611] of Jerusalem[^h3389], that remain[^h7604] in this land[^h776], and them that dwell[^h3427] in the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]:
###### 9
And I will deliver[^h5414] them to be removed[^h2189] [^h2113] into all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776] for their hurt[^h7451], to be a reproach[^h2781] and a proverb[^h4912], a taunt[^h8148] and a curse[^h7045], in all places[^h4725] whither I shall drive[^h5080] them. 
###### 10
And I will send[^h7971] the sword[^h2719], the famine[^h7458], and the pestilence[^h1698], among them, till they be consumed[^h8552] from off the land[^h127] that I gave[^h5414] unto them and to their fathers[^h1].

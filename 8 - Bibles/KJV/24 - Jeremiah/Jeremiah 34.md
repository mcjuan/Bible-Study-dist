###### 1
The word[^h1697] which came unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], when Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and all his army[^h2428], and all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776] of his dominion[^h3027] [^h4475], and all the people[^h5971], fought[^h3898] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and against all the cities[^h5892] thereof, saying[^h559], 
###### 2
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; Go[^h1980] and speak[^h559] to Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063], and tell[^h559] him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Behold, I will give[^h5414] this city[^h5892] into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784]:
###### 3
And thou shalt not escape out[^h4422] of his hand[^h3027], but shalt surely[^h8610] be taken[^h8610], and delivered[^h5414] into his hand[^h3027]; and thine eyes[^h5869] shall behold[^h7200] the eyes[^h5869] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894], and he shall speak[^h1696] with thee mouth[^h6310] to mouth[^h6310], and thou shalt go[^h935] to Babylon[^h894]. 
###### 4
Yet hear[^h8085] the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068], O Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063]; Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of thee, Thou shalt not die[^h4191] by the sword[^h2719]:
###### 5
But thou shalt die[^h4191] in peace[^h7965]: and with the burnings[^h4955] of thy fathers[^h1], the former[^h7223] kings[^h4428] which were before[^h6440] thee, so shall they burn[^h8313] odours for thee; and they will lament[^h5594] thee, saying, Ah[^h1945] lord[^h113]! for I have pronounced[^h1696] the word[^h1697], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
Then Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030] spake[^h1696] all these words[^h1697] unto Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] in Jerusalem[^h3389],
###### 7
When the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] army[^h2428] fought[^h3898] against Jerusalem[^h3389], and against all the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] that were left[^h3498], against Lachish[^h3923], and against Azekah[^h5825]: for these defenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892] remained[^h7604] of the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 8
This is the word[^h1697] that came unto Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], after[^h310] that the king[^h4428] Zedekiah[^h6667] had made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with all the people[^h5971] which were at Jerusalem[^h3389], to proclaim[^h7121] liberty[^h1865] unto them;
###### 9
That every man[^h376] should let his manservant[^h5650], and every man[^h376] his maidservant[^h8198], being an Hebrew[^h5680] or an Hebrewess[^h5680], go[^h7971] free[^h2670]; that none should serve[^h5647] himself of them, to wit, of a Jew[^h3064] his brother[^h251].
###### 10
Now when all the princes[^h8269], and all the people[^h5971], which had entered[^h935] into the covenant[^h1285], heard[^h8085] that every one[^h376] should let his manservant[^h5650], and every one[^h376] his maidservant[^h8198], go[^h7971] free[^h2670], that none should serve[^h5647] themselves of them any more, then they obeyed[^h8085], and let them go[^h7971].
###### 11
But afterward[^h310] they turned[^h7725], and caused the servants[^h5650] and the handmaids[^h8198], whom they had let go[^h7971] free[^h2670], to return[^h7725], and brought them into subjection[^h3533] [^h3533] for servants[^h5650] and for handmaids[^h8198].
###### 12
Therefore the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Jeremiah[^h3414] from the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559],
###### 13
Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]; I made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with your fathers[^h1] in the day[^h3117] that I brought them forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714], out of the house[^h1004] of bondmen[^h5650], saying[^h559],
###### 14
At the end[^h7093] of seven[^h7651] years[^h8141] let ye go[^h7971] every man[^h376] his brother[^h251] an Hebrew[^h5680], which hath been sold[^h4376] unto thee; and when he hath served[^h5647] thee six[^h8337] years[^h8141], thou shalt let him go[^h7971] free[^h2670] from thee: but your fathers[^h1] hearkened[^h8085] not unto me, neither inclined[^h5186] their ear[^h241]. 
###### 15
And ye were now[^h3117] turned[^h7725], and had done[^h6213] right[^h3477] in my sight[^h5869], in proclaiming[^h7121] liberty[^h1865] every man[^h376] to his neighbour[^h7453]; and ye had made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] before[^h6440] me in the house[^h1004] which is called[^h7121] by my name[^h8034]:  
###### 16
But ye turned[^h7725] and polluted[^h2490] my name[^h8034], and caused every man[^h376] his servant[^h5650], and every man[^h376] his handmaid[^h8198], whom ye had set[^h7971] at liberty[^h2670] at their pleasure[^h5315], to return[^h7725], and brought them into subjection[^h3533], to be unto you for servants[^h5650] and for handmaids[^h8198].
###### 17
Therefore thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]; Ye have not hearkened[^h8085] unto me, in proclaiming[^h7121] liberty[^h1865], every one[^h376] to his brother[^h251], and every man[^h376] to his neighbour[^h7453]: behold, I proclaim[^h7121] a liberty[^h1865] for you, saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], to the sword[^h2719], to the pestilence[^h1698], and to the famine[^h7458]; and I will make[^h5414] you to be removed[^h2189] [^h2113] into all the kingdoms[^h4467] of the earth[^h776]. 
###### 18
And I will give[^h5414] the men[^h582] that have transgressed[^h5674] my covenant[^h1285], which have not performed[^h6965] the words[^h1697] of the covenant[^h1285] which they had made[^h3772] before[^h6440] me, when they cut[^h3772] the calf[^h5695] in twain[^h8147], and passed[^h5674] between the parts[^h1335] thereof,
###### 19
The princes[^h8269] of Judah[^h3063], and the princes[^h8269] of Jerusalem[^h3389], the eunuchs[^h5631], and the priests[^h3548], and all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776], which passed[^h5674] between the parts[^h1335] of the calf[^h5695];
###### 20
I will even give[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341], and into the hand[^h3027] of them that seek[^h1245] their life[^h5315]: and their dead bodies[^h5038] shall be for meat[^h3978] unto the fowls[^h5775] of the heaven[^h8064], and to the beasts[^h929] of the earth[^h776].
###### 21
And Zedekiah[^h6667] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] and his princes[^h8269] will I give[^h5414] into the hand[^h3027] of their enemies[^h341], and into the hand[^h3027] of them that seek[^h1245] their life[^h5315], and into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Babylon's[^h894] army[^h2428], which are gone up[^h5927] from you.
###### 22
Behold, I will command[^h6680], saith[^h5002] the LORD[^h3068], and cause them to return[^h7725] to this city[^h5892]; and they shall fight[^h3898] against it, and take[^h3920] it, and burn[^h8313] it with fire[^h784]: and I will make[^h5414] the cities[^h5892] of Judah[^h3063] a desolation[^h8077] without an inhabitant[^h3427].

###### 1
And now, O ye priests[^h3548], this commandment[^h4687] is for you.
###### 2
If ye will not hear[^h8085], and if ye will not lay[^h7760] it to heart[^h3820], to give[^h5414] glory[^h3519] unto my name[^h8034], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], I will even send[^h7971] a curse[^h3994] upon you, and I will curse[^h779] your blessings[^h1293]: yea, I have cursed[^h779] them already, because ye do not lay[^h7760] it to heart[^h3820].
###### 3
Behold, I will corrupt[^h1605] your seed[^h2233], and spread[^h2219] dung[^h6569] upon your faces[^h6440], even the dung[^h6569] of your solemn feasts[^h2282]; and one shall take you away[^h5375] with it.   
###### 4
And ye shall know[^h3045] that I have sent[^h7971] this commandment[^h4687] unto you, that my covenant[^h1285] might be with Levi[^h3878], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 5
My covenant[^h1285] was with him of life[^h2416] and peace[^h7965]; and I gave[^h5414] them to him for the fear[^h4172] wherewith he feared[^h3372] me, and was afraid[^h2865] before[^h6440] my name[^h8034].
###### 6
The law[^h8451] of truth[^h571] was in his mouth[^h6310], and iniquity[^h5766] was not found[^h4672] in his lips[^h8193]: he walked[^h1980] with me in peace[^h7965] and equity[^h4334], and did turn[^h7725] many[^h7227] away[^h7725] from iniquity[^h5771].
###### 7
For the priest's[^h3548] lips[^h8193] should keep[^h8104] knowledge[^h1847], and they should seek[^h1245] the law[^h8451] at his mouth[^h6310]: for he is the messenger[^h4397] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 8
But ye are departed[^h5493] out of the way[^h1870]; ye have caused many[^h7227] to stumble[^h3782] at the law[^h8451]; ye have corrupted[^h7843] the covenant[^h1285] of Levi[^h3878], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 9
Therefore have I also made[^h5414] you contemptible[^h959] and base[^h8217] before all the people[^h5971], according[^h6310] as ye have not kept[^h8104] my ways[^h1870], but have been partial[^h5375] [^h6440] in the law[^h8451]. 
###### 10
Have we not all one[^h259] father[^h1]? hath not one[^h259] God[^h410] created[^h1254] us? why do we deal treacherously[^h898] every man[^h376] against his brother[^h251], by profaning[^h2490] the covenant[^h1285] of our fathers[^h1]?
###### 11
Judah[^h3063] hath dealt treacherously[^h898], and an abomination[^h8441] is committed[^h6213] in Israel[^h3478] and in Jerusalem[^h3389]; for Judah[^h3063] hath profaned[^h2490] the holiness[^h6944] of the LORD[^h3068] which he loved[^h157], and hath married[^h1166] the daughter[^h1323] of a strange[^h5236] god[^h410]. 
###### 12
The LORD[^h3068] will cut off[^h3772] the man[^h376] that doeth[^h6213] this, the master[^h5782] and the scholar[^h6030], out of the tabernacles[^h168] of Jacob[^h3290], and him that offereth[^h5066] an offering[^h4503] unto the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 13
And this have ye done[^h6213] again[^h8145], covering[^h3680] the altar[^h4196] of the LORD[^h3068] with tears[^h1832], with weeping[^h1065], and with crying out[^h603], insomuch that he regardeth[^h6437] not the offering[^h4503] any more, or receiveth[^h3947] it with good will[^h7522] at your hand[^h3027].
###### 14
Yet ye say[^h559], Wherefore[^h4100]? Because the LORD[^h3068] hath been witness[^h5749] between thee and the wife[^h802] of thy youth[^h5271], against whom thou hast dealt treacherously[^h898]: yet is she thy companion[^h2278], and the wife[^h802] of thy covenant[^h1285].
###### 15
And did not he make[^h6213] one[^h259]? Yet had he the residue[^h7605] of the spirit[^h7307]. And wherefore one[^h259]? That he might seek[^h1245] a godly[^h430] seed[^h2233]. Therefore take heed[^h8104] to your spirit[^h7307], and let none deal treacherously[^h898] against the wife[^h802] of his youth[^h5271].   
###### 16
For the LORD[^h3068], the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], saith[^h559] that he hateth[^h8130] putting away[^h7971]: for one covereth[^h3680] violence[^h2555] with his garment[^h3830], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]: therefore take heed[^h8104] to your spirit[^h7307], that ye deal not treacherously[^h898].  
###### 17
Ye have wearied[^h3021] the LORD[^h3068] with your words[^h1697]. Yet ye say[^h559], Wherein have we wearied[^h3021] him? When ye say[^h559], Every one that doeth[^h6213] evil[^h7451] is good[^h2896] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and he delighteth[^h2654] in them; or, Where is the God[^h430] of judgment[^h4941]?

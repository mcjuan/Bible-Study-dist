###### 1
Behold, I will send[^h7971] my messenger[^h4397], and he shall prepare[^h6437] the way[^h1870] before[^h6440] me: and the Lord[^h113], whom ye seek[^h1245], shall suddenly[^h6597] come[^h935] to his temple[^h1964], even the messenger[^h4397] of the covenant[^h1285], whom ye delight[^h2655] in: behold, he shall come[^h935], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 2
But who may abide[^h3557] the day[^h3117] of his coming[^h935]? and who shall stand[^h5975] when he appeareth[^h7200]? for he is like a refiner's[^h6884] fire[^h784], and like fullers'[^h3526] soap[^h1287]:
###### 3
And he shall sit[^h3427] as a refiner[^h6884] and purifier[^h2891] of silver[^h3701]: and he shall purify[^h2891] the sons[^h1121] of Levi[^h3878], and purge[^h2212] them as gold[^h2091] and silver[^h3701], that they may offer[^h5066] unto the LORD[^h3068] an offering[^h4503] in righteousness[^h6666].
###### 4
Then shall the offering[^h4503] of Judah[^h3063] and Jerusalem[^h3389] be pleasant[^h6149] unto the LORD[^h3068], as in the days[^h3117] of old[^h5769], and as in former[^h6931] years[^h8141]. 
###### 5
And I will come near[^h7126] to you to judgment[^h4941]; and I will be a swift[^h4116] witness[^h5707] against the sorcerers[^h3784], and against the adulterers[^h5003], and against false[^h8267] swearers[^h7650], and against those that oppress[^h6231] the hireling[^h7916] in his wages[^h7939], the widow[^h490], and the fatherless[^h3490], and that turn aside[^h5186] the stranger[^h1616] from his right, and fear[^h3372] not me, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 6
For I am the LORD[^h3068], I change[^h8138] not; therefore ye sons[^h1121] of Jacob[^h3290] are not consumed[^h3615].
###### 7
Even from the days[^h3117] of your fathers[^h1] ye are gone away[^h5493] from mine ordinances[^h2706], and have not kept[^h8104] them. Return[^h7725] unto me, and I will return[^h7725] unto you, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. But ye said[^h559], Wherein shall we return[^h7725]?
###### 8
Will a man[^h120] rob[^h6906] God[^h430]? Yet ye have robbed[^h6906] me. But ye say[^h559], Wherein have we robbed[^h6906] thee? In tithes[^h4643] and offerings[^h8641].
###### 9
Ye are cursed[^h779] with a curse[^h3994]: for ye have robbed[^h6906] me, even this whole nation[^h1471].
###### 10
Bring[^h935] ye all the tithes[^h4643] into the storehouse[^h214], that there may be meat[^h2964] in mine house[^h1004], and prove[^h974] me now herewith[^h2063], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], if I will not open[^h6605] you the windows[^h699] of heaven[^h8064], and pour you out[^h7324] a blessing[^h1293], that there shall not be room enough[^h1767] to receive it. 
###### 11
And I will rebuke[^h1605] the devourer[^h398] for your sakes, and he shall not destroy[^h7843] the fruits[^h6529] of your ground[^h127]; neither shall your vine[^h1612] cast her fruit[^h7921] before the time in the field[^h7704], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]. 
###### 12
And all nations[^h1471] shall call you blessed[^h833]: for ye shall be a delightsome[^h2656] land[^h776], saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635].
###### 13
Your words[^h1697] have been stout[^h2388] against me, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068]. Yet ye say[^h559], What have we spoken[^h1696] so much against thee?
###### 14
Ye have said[^h559], It is vain[^h7723] to serve[^h5647] God[^h430]: and what profit[^h1215] is it that we have kept[^h8104] his ordinance[^h4931], and that we have walked[^h1980] mournfully[^h6941] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635]?  
###### 15
And now we call[^h833] the proud[^h2086] happy[^h833]; yea, they that work[^h6213] wickedness[^h7564] are set up[^h1129]; yea, they that tempt[^h974] God[^h430] are even delivered[^h4422]. 
###### 16
Then they that feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068] spake often[^h1696] one[^h376] to another[^h7453]: and the LORD[^h3068] hearkened[^h7181], and heard[^h8085] it, and a book[^h5612] of remembrance[^h2146] was written[^h3789] before[^h6440] him for them that feared[^h3373] the LORD[^h3068], and that thought[^h2803] upon his name[^h8034].
###### 17
And they shall be mine, saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], in that day[^h3117] when I make up[^h6213] my jewels[^h5459]; and I will spare[^h2550] them, as a man[^h376] spareth[^h2550] his own son[^h1121] that serveth[^h5647] him. 
###### 18
Then shall ye return[^h7725], and discern[^h7200] between the righteous[^h6662] and the wicked[^h7563], between him that serveth[^h5647] God[^h430] and him that serveth[^h5647] him not.

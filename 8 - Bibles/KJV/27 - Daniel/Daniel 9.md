###### 1
In the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of Darius[^h1867] the son[^h1121] of Ahasuerus[^h325], of the seed[^h2233] of the Medes[^h4074], which was made king[^h4427] over the realm[^h4438] of the Chaldeans[^h3778]; 
###### 2
In the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of his reign[^h4427] I Daniel[^h1840] understood[^h995] by books[^h5612] the number[^h4557] of the years[^h8141], whereof the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] came to Jeremiah[^h3414] the prophet[^h5030], that he would accomplish[^h4390] seventy[^h7657] years[^h8141] in the desolations[^h2723] of Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 3
And I set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] unto the Lord[^h136] God[^h430], to seek[^h1245] by prayer[^h8605] and supplications[^h8469], with fasting[^h6685], and sackcloth[^h8242], and ashes[^h665]:
###### 4
And I prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430], and made my confession[^h3034], and said[^h559], O[^h577] Lord[^h136], the great[^h1419] and dreadful[^h3372] God[^h410], keeping[^h8104] the covenant[^h1285] and mercy[^h2617] to them that love[^h157] him, and to them that keep[^h8104] his commandments[^h4687];
###### 5
We have sinned[^h2398], and have committed iniquity[^h5753], and have done wickedly[^h7561], and have rebelled[^h4775], even by departing[^h5493] from thy precepts[^h4687] and from thy judgments[^h4941]:
###### 6
Neither have we hearkened[^h8085] unto thy servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030], which spake[^h1696] in thy name[^h8034] to our kings[^h4428], our princes[^h8269], and our fathers[^h1], and to all the people[^h5971] of the land[^h776].
###### 7
O Lord[^h136], righteousness[^h6666] belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion[^h1322] of faces[^h6440], as at this day[^h3117]; to the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063], and to the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jerusalem[^h3389], and unto all Israel[^h3478], that are near[^h7138], and that are far off[^h7350], through all the countries[^h776] whither thou hast driven[^h5080] them, because of their trespass[^h4604] that they have trespassed[^h4603] against thee. 
###### 8
O Lord[^h136], to us belongeth confusion[^h1322] of face[^h6440], to our kings[^h4428], to our princes[^h8269], and to our fathers[^h1], because we have sinned[^h2398] against thee.
###### 9
To the Lord[^h136] our God[^h430] belong mercies[^h7356] and forgivenesses[^h5547], though we have rebelled[^h4775] against him;
###### 10
Neither have we obeyed[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], to walk[^h3212] in his laws[^h8451], which he set[^h5414] before[^h6440] us by[^h3027] his servants[^h5650] the prophets[^h5030].
###### 11
Yea, all Israel[^h3478] have transgressed[^h5674] thy law[^h8451], even by departing[^h5493], that they might not obey[^h8085] thy voice[^h6963]; therefore the curse[^h423] is poured[^h5413] upon us, and the oath[^h7621] that is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872] the servant[^h5650] of God[^h430], because we have sinned[^h2398] against him.
###### 12
And he hath confirmed[^h6965] his words[^h1697], which he spake[^h1696] against us, and against our judges[^h8199] that judged[^h8199] us, by bringing[^h935] upon us a great[^h1419] evil[^h7451]: for under the whole heaven[^h8064] hath not been done[^h6213] as hath been done[^h6213] upon Jerusalem[^h3389].
###### 13
As it is written[^h3789] in the law[^h8451] of Moses[^h4872], all this evil[^h7451] is come[^h935] upon us: yet made we not our prayer[^h2470] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430], that we might turn[^h7725] from our iniquities[^h5771], and understand[^h7919] thy truth[^h571]. 
###### 14
Therefore hath the LORD[^h3068] watched[^h8245] upon the evil[^h7451], and brought[^h935] it upon us: for the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] is righteous[^h6662] in all his works[^h4639] which he doeth[^h6213]: for we obeyed[^h8085] not his voice[^h6963].
###### 15
And now, O Lord[^h136] our God[^h430], that hast brought[^h3318] thy people[^h5971] forth[^h3318] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] with a mighty[^h2389] hand[^h3027], and hast gotten[^h6213] thee renown[^h8034], as at this day[^h3117]; we have sinned[^h2398], we have done wickedly[^h7561]. 
###### 16
O Lord[^h136], according to all thy righteousness[^h6666], I beseech thee, let thine anger[^h639] and thy fury[^h2534] be turned away[^h7725] from thy city[^h5892] Jerusalem[^h3389], thy holy[^h6944] mountain[^h2022]: because for our sins[^h2399], and for the iniquities[^h5771] of our fathers[^h1], Jerusalem[^h3389] and thy people[^h5971] are become a reproach[^h2781] to all that are about[^h5439] us.
###### 17
Now therefore, O our God[^h430], hear[^h8085] the prayer[^h8605] of thy servant[^h5650], and his supplications[^h8469], and cause thy face[^h6440] to shine[^h215] upon thy sanctuary[^h4720] that is desolate[^h8076], for the Lord's[^h136] sake.
###### 18
O my God[^h430], incline[^h5186] thine ear[^h241], and hear[^h8085]; open[^h6491] thine eyes[^h5869], and behold[^h7200] our desolations[^h8074], and the city[^h5892] which is called[^h7121] by thy name[^h8034]: for we do not present[^h5307] our supplications[^h8469] before[^h6440] thee for our righteousnesses[^h6666], but for thy great[^h7227] mercies[^h7356].  
###### 19
O Lord[^h136], hear[^h8085]; O Lord[^h136], forgive[^h5545]; O Lord[^h136], hearken[^h7181] and do[^h6213]; defer[^h309] not[^h408], for thine own sake, O my God[^h430]: for thy city[^h5892] and thy people[^h5971] are called[^h7121] by thy name[^h8034].
###### 20
And whiles I was speaking[^h1696], and praying[^h6419], and confessing[^h3034] my sin[^h2403] and the sin[^h2403] of my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], and presenting[^h5307] my supplication[^h8467] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] my God[^h430] for the holy[^h6944] mountain[^h2022] of my God[^h430];
###### 21
Yea, whiles I was speaking[^h1696] in prayer[^h8605], even the man[^h376] Gabriel[^h1403], whom I had seen[^h7200] in the vision[^h2377] at the beginning[^h8462], being caused to fly[^h3286] swiftly[^h3288], touched[^h5060] me about the time[^h6256] of the evening[^h6153] oblation[^h4503]. 
###### 22
And he informed[^h995] me, and talked[^h1696] with me, and said[^h559], O Daniel[^h1840], I am now come forth[^h3318] to give thee skill[^h7919] and understanding[^h998]. 
###### 23
At the beginning[^h8462] of thy supplications[^h8469] the commandment[^h1697] came forth[^h3318], and I am come[^h935] to shew[^h5046] thee; for thou art greatly beloved[^h2532]: therefore understand[^h995] the matter[^h1697], and consider[^h995] the vision[^h4758].  
###### 24
Seventy[^h7657] weeks[^h7620] are determined[^h2852] upon thy people[^h5971] and upon thy holy[^h6944] city[^h5892], to finish[^h3607] the transgression[^h6588], and to make an end[^h8552] [^h2856] of sins[^h2403], and to make reconciliation[^h3722] for iniquity[^h5771], and to bring in[^h935] everlasting[^h5769] righteousness[^h6664], and to seal up[^h2856] the vision[^h2377] and prophecy[^h5030], and to anoint[^h4886] the most[^h6944] Holy[^h6944].   
###### 25
Know[^h3045] therefore and understand[^h7919], that from the going forth[^h4161] of the commandment[^h1697] to restore[^h7725] and to build[^h1129] Jerusalem[^h3389] unto the Messiah[^h4899] the Prince[^h5057] shall be seven[^h7651] weeks[^h7620], and threescore[^h8346] and two[^h8147] weeks[^h7620]: the street[^h7339] shall be built[^h1129] again[^h7725], and the wall[^h2742], even in troublous[^h6695] times[^h6256].   
###### 26
And after[^h310] threescore[^h8346] and two[^h8147] weeks[^h7620] shall Messiah[^h4899] be cut off[^h3772], but not for himself: and the people[^h5971] of the prince[^h5057] that shall come[^h935] shall destroy[^h7843] the city[^h5892] and the sanctuary[^h6944]; and the end[^h7093] thereof shall be with a flood[^h7858], and unto the end[^h7093] of the war[^h4421] desolations[^h8074] are determined[^h2782].  
###### 27
And he shall confirm[^h1396] the covenant[^h1285] with many[^h7227] for one[^h259] week[^h7620]: and in the midst[^h2677] of the week[^h7620] he shall cause the sacrifice[^h2077] and the oblation[^h4503] to cease[^h7673], and for the overspreading[^h3671] of abominations[^h8251] he shall make it desolate[^h8074], even until the consummation[^h3617], and that determined[^h2782] shall be poured[^h5413] upon the desolate[^h8074].

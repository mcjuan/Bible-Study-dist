###### 1
In the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of Cyrus[^h3566] king[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539] a thing[^h1697] was revealed[^h1540] unto Daniel[^h1840], whose name[^h8034] was called[^h7121] Belteshazzar[^h1095]; and the thing[^h1697] was true[^h571], but the time appointed[^h6635] was long[^h1419]: and he understood[^h995] the thing[^h1697], and had understanding[^h998] of the vision[^h4758]. 
###### 2
In those days[^h3117] I Daniel[^h1840] was mourning[^h56] three[^h7969] full[^h3117] weeks[^h7620]. 
###### 3
I ate[^h398] no pleasant[^h2532] bread[^h3899], neither came[^h935] flesh[^h1320] nor wine[^h3196] in my mouth[^h6310], neither did I anoint[^h5480] myself at all[^h5480], till three[^h7969] whole[^h3117] weeks[^h7620] were fulfilled[^h4390]. 
###### 4
And in the four[^h702] and twentieth[^h6242] day[^h3117] of the first[^h7223] month[^h2320], as I was by the side[^h3027] of the great[^h1419] river[^h5104], which is Hiddekel[^h2313];
###### 5
Then I lifted up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and looked[^h7200], and behold a certain[^h259] man[^h376] clothed[^h3847] in linen[^h906], whose loins[^h4975] were girded[^h2296] with fine gold[^h3800] of Uphaz[^h210]: 
###### 6
His body[^h1472] also was like the beryl[^h8658], and his face[^h6440] as the appearance[^h4758] of lightning[^h1300], and his eyes[^h5869] as lamps[^h3940] of fire[^h784], and his arms[^h2220] and his feet[^h4772] like in colour[^h5869] to polished[^h7044] brass[^h5178], and the voice[^h6963] of his words[^h1697] like the voice[^h6963] of a multitude[^h1995].
###### 7
And I Daniel[^h1840] alone saw[^h7200] the vision[^h4759]: for the men[^h582] that were with me saw[^h7200] not the vision[^h4759]; but[^h61] a great[^h1419] quaking[^h2731] fell[^h5307] upon them, so that they fled[^h1272] to hide[^h2244] themselves.
###### 8
Therefore I was left alone[^h7604], and saw[^h7200] this great[^h1419] vision[^h4759], and there remained[^h7604] no strength[^h3581] in me: for my comeliness[^h1935] was turned[^h2015] in me into corruption[^h4889], and I retained[^h6113] no strength[^h3581]. 
###### 9
Yet heard[^h8085] I the voice[^h6963] of his words[^h1697]: and when I heard[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of his words[^h1697], then was I in a deep sleep[^h7290] on my face[^h6440], and my face[^h6440] toward the ground[^h776].
###### 10
And, behold, an hand[^h3027] touched[^h5060] me, which set[^h5128] me upon my knees[^h1290] and upon the palms[^h3709] of my hands[^h3027]. 
###### 11
And he said[^h559] unto me, O Daniel[^h1840], a man[^h376] greatly beloved[^h2532], understand[^h995] the words[^h1697] that I speak[^h1696] unto thee, and stand[^h5975] upright[^h5977]: for unto thee am I now sent[^h7971]. And when he had spoken[^h1696] this word[^h1697] unto me, I stood[^h5975] trembling[^h7460].  
###### 12
Then said[^h559] he unto me, Fear[^h3372] not, Daniel[^h1840]: for from the first[^h7223] day[^h3117] that thou didst set[^h5414] thine heart[^h3820] to understand[^h995], and to chasten[^h6031] thyself before[^h6440] thy God[^h430], thy words[^h1697] were heard[^h8085], and I am come[^h935] for thy words[^h1697].
###### 13
But the prince[^h8269] of the kingdom[^h4438] of Persia[^h6539] withstood[^h5975] me one[^h259] and twenty[^h6242] days[^h3117]: but, lo, Michael[^h4317], one[^h259] of the chief[^h7223] princes[^h8269], came[^h935] to help[^h5826] me; and I remained[^h3498] there with[^h681] the kings[^h4428] of Persia[^h6539]. 
###### 14
Now I am come[^h935] to make thee understand[^h995] what shall befall[^h7136] thy people[^h5971] in the latter[^h319] days[^h3117]: for yet the vision[^h2377] is for many days[^h3117].
###### 15
And when he had spoken[^h1696] such words[^h1697] unto me, I set[^h5414] my face[^h6440] toward the ground[^h776], and I became dumb[^h481].
###### 16
And, behold, one like the similitude[^h1823] of the sons[^h1121] of men[^h120] touched[^h5060] my lips[^h8193]: then I opened[^h6605] my mouth[^h6310], and spake[^h1696], and said[^h559] unto him that stood[^h5975] before me, O my lord[^h113], by the vision[^h4759] my sorrows[^h6735] are turned[^h2015] upon me, and I have retained[^h6113] no strength[^h3581].
###### 17
For how[^h1963] can[^h3201] the servant[^h5650] of this my lord[^h113] talk[^h1696] with this my lord[^h113]? for as for me, straightway[^h6258] there remained[^h5975] no strength[^h3581] in me, neither is there breath[^h5397] left[^h7604] in me. 
###### 18
Then there came again[^h3254] and touched[^h5060] me one like the appearance[^h4758] of a man[^h120], and he strengthened[^h2388] me,
###### 19
And said[^h559], O man[^h376] greatly beloved[^h2532], fear[^h3372] not: peace[^h7965] be unto thee, be strong[^h2388], yea, be strong[^h2388]. And when he had spoken[^h1696] unto me, I was strengthened[^h2388], and said[^h559], Let my lord[^h113] speak[^h1696]; for thou hast strengthened[^h2388] me.
###### 20
Then said[^h559] he, Knowest[^h3045] thou wherefore I come[^h935] unto thee? and now will I return[^h7725] to fight[^h3898] with the prince[^h8269] of Persia[^h6539]: and when I am gone forth[^h3318], lo, the prince[^h8269] of Grecia[^h3120] shall come[^h935].
###### 21
But[^h61] I will shew[^h5046] thee that which is noted[^h7559] in the scripture[^h3791] of truth[^h571]: and there is none[^h259] that holdeth[^h2388] with me in these things, but Michael[^h4317] your prince[^h8269].

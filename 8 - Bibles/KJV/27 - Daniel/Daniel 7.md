###### 1
In the first[^h2298] year[^h8140] of Belshazzar[^h1113] king[^h4430] of Babylon[^h895] Daniel[^h1841] had[^h2370] a dream[^h2493] and visions[^h2376] of his head[^h7217] upon[^h5922] his bed[^h4903]: then[^h116] he wrote[^h3790] the dream[^h2493], and told[^h560] the sum[^h7217] of the matters[^h4406].  
###### 2
Daniel[^h1841] spake[^h6032] and said[^h560], I saw[^h2370] [^h1934] in my vision[^h2376] by[^h5974] night[^h3916], and, behold[^h718], the four[^h703] winds[^h7308] of the heaven[^h8065] strove[^h1519] upon the great[^h7229] sea[^h3221].
###### 3
And four[^h703] great[^h7260] beasts[^h2423] came up[^h5559] from[^h4481] the sea[^h3221], diverse[^h8133] one[^h1668] from[^h4481] another[^h1668].
###### 4
The first[^h6933] was like a lion[^h744], and had eagle's[^h5403] wings[^h1611]: I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370] till[^h5705] the wings[^h1611] thereof were plucked[^h4804], and it was lifted up[^h5191] from[^h4481] the earth[^h772], and made stand[^h6966] upon[^h5922] the feet[^h7271] as a man[^h606], and a man's[^h606] heart[^h3825] was given[^h3052] to it. 
###### 5
And behold[^h718] another[^h317] beast[^h2423], a second[^h8578], like[^h1821] to a bear[^h1678], and it raised up[^h6966] itself on one[^h2298] side[^h7859], and it had three[^h8532] ribs[^h5967] in the mouth[^h6433] of it between[^h997] the teeth[^h8128] of it: and they said[^h560] thus[^h3652] unto it, Arise[^h6966], devour[^h399] much[^h7690] flesh[^h1321]. 
###### 6
After[^h870] this[^h1836] I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370], and lo[^h718] another[^h317], like a leopard[^h5245], which had upon[^h5922] the back[^h1355] of it four[^h703] wings[^h1611] of a fowl[^h5776]; the beast[^h2423] had also four[^h703] heads[^h7217]; and dominion[^h7985] was given[^h3052] to it.
###### 7
After[^h870] this[^h1836] I saw[^h1934] [^h2370] in the night[^h3916] visions[^h2376], and behold[^h718] a fourth[^h7244] beast[^h2423], dreadful[^h1763] and terrible[^h574], and strong[^h8624] exceedingly[^h3493]; and it had great[^h7260] iron[^h6523] teeth[^h8128]: it devoured[^h399] and brake in pieces[^h1855], and stamped[^h7512] the residue[^h7606] with the feet[^h7271] of it: and it[^h1932] was diverse[^h8133] from[^h4481] all[^h3606] the beasts[^h2423] that were before[^h6925] it; and it had ten[^h6236] horns[^h7162].
###### 8
I considered[^h1934] [^h7920] the horns[^h7162], and, behold[^h431], there came up[^h5559] among[^h997] them another[^h317] little[^h2192] horn[^h7162], before[^h6925] [^h4481] whom there were three[^h8532] of[^h4481] the first[^h6933] horns[^h7162] plucked up by the roots[^h6132]: and, behold[^h431], in this[^h1668] horn[^h7162] were eyes[^h5870] like the eyes[^h5870] of man[^h606], and a mouth[^h6433] speaking[^h4449] great things[^h7260].
###### 9
I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370] till[^h5705] the thrones[^h3764] were cast down[^h7412], and the Ancient[^h6268] of days[^h3118] did sit[^h3488], whose garment[^h3831] was white[^h2358] as snow[^h8517], and the hair[^h8177] of his head[^h7217] like the pure[^h5343] wool[^h6015]: his throne[^h3764] was like the fiery[^h5135] flame[^h7631], and his wheels[^h1535] as burning[^h1815] fire[^h5135].
###### 10
A fiery[^h5135] stream[^h5103] issued[^h5047] and came forth[^h5312] from[^h4481] before[^h6925] him: thousand[^h506] thousands[^h506] ministered[^h8120] unto him, and ten thousand[^h7240] times ten thousand[^h7240] stood[^h6966] before[^h6925] him: the judgment[^h1780] was set[^h3488], and the books[^h5609] were opened[^h6606].
###### 11
I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370] then[^h116] because[^h4481] of the voice[^h7032] of the great[^h7260] words[^h4406] which the horn[^h7162] spake[^h4449]: I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370] even till[^h5705] the beast[^h2423] was slain[^h6992], and his body[^h1655] destroyed[^h7], and given[^h3052] to the burning[^h3346] flame[^h785].
###### 12
As concerning the rest[^h7606] of the beasts[^h2423], they had their dominion[^h7985] taken away[^h5709]: yet their lives[^h2417] were prolonged[^h3052] for[^h5705] a season[^h2166] and time[^h5732]. 
###### 13
I saw[^h1934] [^h2370] in the night[^h3916] visions[^h2376], and, behold[^h718], one like the Son[^h1247] of man[^h606] came[^h858] with[^h5974] the clouds[^h6050] of heaven[^h8065], and came[^h4291] to[^h5705] the Ancient[^h6268] of days[^h3118], and they brought him near[^h7127] before[^h6925] him.
###### 14
And there was given[^h3052] him dominion[^h7985], and glory[^h3367], and a kingdom[^h4437], that all[^h3606] people[^h5972], nations[^h524], and languages[^h3961], should serve[^h6399] him: his dominion[^h7985] is an everlasting[^h5957] dominion[^h7985], which shall not[^h3809] pass away[^h5709], and his kingdom[^h4437] that which shall not[^h3809] be destroyed[^h2255].
###### 15
I[^h576] Daniel[^h1841] was grieved[^h3735] in my spirit[^h7308] in the midst[^h1459] of my body[^h5085], and the visions[^h2376] of my head[^h7217] troubled[^h927] me. 
###### 16
I came near[^h7127] unto[^h5922] one[^h2298] of[^h4481] them that stood by[^h6966], and asked[^h1156] him[^h4481] the truth[^h3330] of all[^h3606] this[^h1836]. So he told[^h560] me, and made me know[^h3046] the interpretation[^h6591] of the things[^h4406].
###### 17
These[^h459] great[^h7260] beasts[^h2423], which[^h581] are four[^h703], are four[^h703] kings[^h4430], which shall arise[^h6966] out of[^h4481] the earth[^h772].
###### 18
But the saints[^h6922] of the most High[^h5946] shall take[^h6902] the kingdom[^h4437], and possess[^h2631] the kingdom[^h4437] for[^h5705] ever[^h5957], even for[^h5705] ever[^h5957] and ever[^h5957]. 
###### 19
Then[^h116] I would[^h6634] know the truth[^h3321] of[^h5922] the fourth[^h7244] beast[^h2423], which was[^h1934] diverse[^h8133] from[^h4481] all[^h3606] the others, exceeding[^h3493] dreadful[^h1763], whose teeth[^h8128] were of iron[^h6523], and his nails[^h2953] of brass[^h5174]; which devoured[^h399], brake in pieces[^h1855], and stamped[^h7512] the residue[^h7606] with his feet[^h7271]; 
###### 20
And of[^h5922] the ten[^h6236] horns[^h7162] that were in his head[^h7217], and of the other[^h317] which came up[^h5559], and before[^h4481] [^h6925] whom three[^h8532] fell[^h5308]; even of that horn[^h7162] that[^h1797] had eyes[^h5870], and a mouth[^h6433] that spake[^h4449] very great things[^h7260], whose look[^h2376] was more[^h4481] stout[^h7229] than[^h4481] his fellows[^h2273].
###### 21
I beheld[^h1934] [^h2370], and the same[^h1797] horn[^h7162] made[^h5648] war[^h7129] with[^h5974] the saints[^h6922], and prevailed[^h3202] against them;
###### 22
Until[^h5705] the Ancient[^h6268] of days[^h3118] came[^h858] [^h1768], and judgment[^h1780] was given[^h3052] to the saints[^h6922] of the most High[^h5946]; and the time[^h2166] came[^h4291] that the saints[^h6922] possessed[^h2631] the kingdom[^h4437].
###### 23
Thus[^h3652] he said[^h560], The fourth[^h7244] beast[^h2423] shall be[^h1934] the fourth[^h7244] kingdom[^h4437] upon earth[^h772], which shall be diverse[^h8133] from[^h4481] all[^h3606] kingdoms[^h4437], and shall devour[^h399] the whole[^h3606] earth[^h772], and shall tread it down[^h1759], and break it in pieces[^h1855].
###### 24
And the ten[^h6236] horns[^h7162] out of[^h4481] this kingdom[^h4437] are ten[^h6236] kings[^h4430] that shall arise[^h6966]: and another[^h321] shall rise[^h6966] after[^h311] them; and he shall be diverse[^h8133] from[^h4481] the first[^h6933], and he shall subdue[^h8214] three[^h8532] kings[^h4430].
###### 25
And he shall speak[^h4449] great words[^h4406] against[^h6655] the most High[^h5943], and shall wear out[^h1080] the saints[^h6922] of the most High[^h5946], and think[^h5452] to change[^h8133] times[^h2166] and laws[^h1882]: and they shall be given[^h3052] into his hand[^h3028] until[^h5705] a time[^h5732] and times[^h5732] and the dividing[^h6387] of time[^h5732].
###### 26
But the judgment[^h1780] shall sit[^h3488], and they shall take away[^h5709] his dominion[^h7985], to consume[^h8046] and to destroy[^h7] it unto[^h5705] the end[^h5491].
###### 27
And the kingdom[^h4437] and dominion[^h7985], and the greatness[^h7238] of the kingdom[^h4437] under[^h8460] the whole[^h3606] heaven[^h8065], shall be given[^h3052] to the people[^h5972] of the saints[^h6922] of the most High[^h5946], whose kingdom[^h4437] is an everlasting[^h5957] kingdom[^h4437], and all[^h3606] dominions[^h7985] shall serve[^h6399] and obey[^h8086] him. 
###### 28
Hitherto[^h5705] [^h3542] is the end[^h5491] of the matter[^h4406]. As for me[^h576] Daniel[^h1841], my cogitations[^h7476] much[^h7690] troubled[^h927] me, and my countenance[^h2122] changed[^h8133] in me[^h5922]: but I kept[^h5202] the matter[^h4406] in my heart[^h3821].

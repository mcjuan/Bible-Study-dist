###### 1
Belshazzar[^h1113] the king[^h4430] made[^h5648] a great[^h7229] feast[^h3900] to a thousand[^h506] of his lords[^h7261], and drank[^h8355] wine[^h2562] before[^h6903] the thousand[^h506].
###### 2
Belshazzar[^h1113], whiles he tasted[^h2942] the wine[^h2562], commanded[^h560] to bring[^h858] the golden[^h1722] and silver[^h3702] vessels[^h3984] which his father[^h2] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] had taken[^h5312] out of[^h4481] the temple[^h1965] which was in Jerusalem[^h3390]; that the king[^h4430], and his princes[^h7261], his wives[^h7695], and his concubines[^h3904], might drink[^h8355] therein.  
###### 3
Then[^h116] they brought[^h858] the golden[^h1722] vessels[^h3984] that were taken[^h5312] out of[^h4481] the temple[^h1965] of the house[^h1005] of God[^h426] which was at Jerusalem[^h3390]; and the king[^h4430], and his princes[^h7261], his wives[^h7695], and his concubines[^h3904], drank[^h8355] in them.
###### 4
They drank[^h8355] wine[^h2562], and praised[^h7624] the gods[^h426] of gold[^h1722], and of silver[^h3702], of brass[^h5174], of iron[^h6523], of wood[^h636], and of stone[^h69].
###### 5
In the same hour[^h8160] came forth[^h5312] fingers[^h677] of a man's[^h606] hand[^h3028], and wrote[^h3790] over against[^h6903] the candlestick[^h5043] upon[^h5922] the plaister[^h1528] of the wall[^h3797] of the king's[^h4430] palace[^h1965]: and the king[^h4430] saw[^h2370] the part[^h6447] of the hand[^h3028] that wrote[^h3790].
###### 6
Then[^h116] the king's[^h4430] countenance[^h2122] was changed[^h8133], and his thoughts[^h7476] troubled[^h927] him, so that the joints[^h7001] of his loins[^h2783] were loosed[^h8271], and his knees[^h755] smote[^h5368] one[^h1668] against another[^h1668].   
###### 7
The king[^h4430] cried[^h7123] aloud[^h2429] to bring[^h5954] in the astrologers[^h826], the Chaldeans[^h3779], and the soothsayers[^h1505]. And the king[^h4430] spake[^h6032], and said[^h560] to the wise[^h2445] men of Babylon[^h895], Whosoever[^h606] [^h3606] shall read[^h7123] this[^h1836] writing[^h3792], and shew[^h2324] me the interpretation[^h6591] thereof, shall be clothed[^h3848] with scarlet[^h711], and have a chain[^h2002] of gold[^h1722] about[^h5922] his neck[^h6676], and shall be the third[^h8523] ruler[^h7981] in the kingdom[^h4437].  
###### 8
Then[^h116] came[^h5954] in all[^h3606] the king's[^h4430] wise[^h2445] men: but they could[^h3546] not[^h3809] read[^h7123] the writing[^h3792], nor make known[^h3046] to the king[^h4430] the interpretation[^h6591] thereof.
###### 9
Then[^h116] was king[^h4430] Belshazzar[^h1113] greatly[^h7690] troubled[^h927], and his countenance[^h2122] was changed[^h8133] in him[^h5922], and his lords[^h7261] were astonied[^h7672]. 
###### 10
Now the queen[^h4433], by reason[^h6903] of the words[^h4406] of the king[^h4430] and his lords[^h7261], came[^h5954] into the banquet[^h4961] house[^h1005]: and the queen[^h4433] spake[^h6032] and said[^h560], O king[^h4430], live[^h2418] for ever[^h5957]: let not[^h409] thy thoughts[^h7476] trouble[^h927] thee, nor let thy countenance[^h2122] be changed[^h8133]:
###### 11
There is[^h383] a man[^h1400] in thy kingdom[^h4437], in whom is the spirit[^h7308] of the holy[^h6922] gods[^h426]; and in the days[^h3118] of thy father[^h2] light[^h5094] and understanding[^h7924] and wisdom[^h2452], like the wisdom[^h2452] of the gods[^h426], was found[^h7912] in him; whom the king[^h4430] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] thy father[^h2], the king[^h4430], I say, thy father[^h2], made[^h6966] master[^h7229] of the magicians[^h2749], astrologers[^h826], Chaldeans[^h3779], and soothsayers[^h1505]; 
###### 12
Forasmuch as[^h6903] [^h3606] an excellent[^h3493] spirit[^h7308], and knowledge[^h4486], and understanding[^h7924], interpreting[^h6590] of dreams[^h2493], and shewing[^h263] of hard sentences[^h280], and dissolving[^h8271] of doubts[^h7001], were found[^h7912] in the same Daniel[^h1841], whom the king[^h4430] named[^h7761] [^h8036] Belteshazzar[^h1096]: now[^h3705] let Daniel[^h1841] be called[^h7123], and he will shew[^h2324] the interpretation[^h6591].   
###### 13
Then[^h116] was Daniel[^h1841] brought in[^h5954] before[^h6925] the king[^h4430]. And the king[^h4430] spake[^h6032] and said[^h560] unto Daniel[^h1841], Art thou[^h607] that Daniel[^h1841], which art of[^h4481] the children[^h1123] of the captivity[^h1547] of Judah[^h3061], whom the king[^h4430] my father[^h2] brought[^h858] out of[^h4481] Jewry[^h3061]? 
###### 14
I have even heard[^h8086] of thee, that the spirit[^h7308] of the gods[^h426] is in thee[^h5922], and that light[^h5094] and understanding[^h7924] and excellent[^h3493] wisdom[^h2452] is found[^h7912] in thee.
###### 15
And now[^h3705] the wise[^h2445] men, the astrologers[^h826], have been brought[^h5954] in before[^h6925] me, that they should read[^h7123] this[^h1836] writing[^h3792], and make known[^h3046] unto me the interpretation[^h6591] thereof: but they could[^h3546] not[^h3809] shew[^h2324] the interpretation[^h6591] of the thing[^h4406]:
###### 16
And I[^h576] have heard[^h8086] of thee[^h5922], that thou canst[^h3202] make[^h6590] interpretations[^h6591], and dissolve[^h8271] doubts[^h7001]: now[^h3705] if[^h2006] thou canst[^h3202] read[^h7123] the writing[^h3792], and make known[^h3046] to me the interpretation[^h6591] thereof, thou shalt be clothed[^h3848] with scarlet[^h711], and have a chain[^h2002] of gold[^h1722] about[^h5922] thy neck[^h6676], and shalt be the third[^h8531] ruler[^h7981] in the kingdom[^h4437]. 
###### 17
Then[^h116] Daniel[^h1841] answered[^h6032] and said[^h560] before[^h6925] the king[^h4430], Let thy gifts[^h4978] be[^h1934] to thyself, and give[^h3052] thy rewards[^h5023] to another[^h321]; yet[^h1297] I will read[^h7123] the writing[^h3792] unto the king[^h4430], and make known[^h3046] to him the interpretation[^h6591]. 
###### 18
O thou[^h607] king[^h4430], the most high[^h5943] God[^h426] gave[^h3052] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] thy father[^h2] a kingdom[^h4437], and majesty[^h7238], and glory[^h3367], and honour[^h1923]:
###### 19
And for[^h4481] the majesty[^h7238] that he gave[^h3052] him, all[^h3606] people[^h5972], nations[^h524], and languages[^h3961], trembled[^h1934] [^h2112] and feared[^h1763] before[^h4481] him[^h6925]: whom he would[^h1934] [^h6634] he slew[^h1934] [^h6992]; and whom he would[^h1934] [^h6634] he kept alive[^h1934] [^h2418]; and whom he would[^h1934] [^h6634] he set up[^h1934] [^h7313]; and whom he would[^h1934] [^h6634] he put down[^h1934] [^h8214].
###### 20
But when his heart[^h3825] was lifted up[^h7313], and his mind[^h7308] hardened[^h8631] in pride[^h2103], he was deposed[^h5182] from[^h4481] his kingly[^h4437] throne[^h3764], and they took[^h5709] his glory[^h3367] from him[^h4481]:  
###### 21
And he was driven[^h2957] from[^h4481] the sons[^h1123] of men[^h606]; and his heart[^h3825] was made[^h7739] like[^h5974] the beasts[^h2423], and his dwelling[^h4070] was with the wild asses[^h6167]: they fed[^h2939] him with grass[^h6211] like oxen[^h8450], and his body[^h1655] was wet[^h6647] with the dew[^h2920] of heaven[^h8065]; till[^h5705] he knew[^h3046] that the most high[^h5943] God[^h426] ruled[^h7990] in the kingdom[^h4437] of men[^h606], and that he appointeth[^h6966] over[^h5922] it whomsoever[^h4479] he will[^h6634]. 
###### 22
And thou[^h607] his son[^h1247], O Belshazzar[^h1113], hast not[^h3809] humbled[^h8214] thine heart[^h3825], though[^h6903] thou knewest[^h3046] all[^h3606] this[^h1836];
###### 23
But hast lifted up[^h7313] thyself against[^h5922] the Lord[^h4756] of heaven[^h8065]; and they have brought[^h858] the vessels[^h3984] of his house[^h1005] before[^h6925] thee, and thou[^h607], and thy lords[^h7261], thy wives[^h7695], and thy concubines[^h3904], have drunk[^h8355] wine[^h2562] in them; and thou hast praised[^h7624] the gods[^h426] of silver[^h3702], and gold[^h1722], of brass[^h5174], iron[^h6523], wood[^h636], and stone[^h69], which see[^h2370] not[^h3809], nor[^h3809] hear[^h8086], nor[^h3809] know[^h3046]: and the God[^h426] in whose hand[^h3028] thy breath[^h5396] is, and whose are all[^h3606] thy ways[^h735], hast thou not[^h3809] glorified[^h1922]:
###### 24
Then[^h116] was the part[^h6447] of the hand[^h3028] sent[^h7972] from[^h4481] him[^h6925]; and this[^h1836] writing[^h3792] was written[^h7560].
###### 25
And this[^h1836] is the writing[^h3792] that was written[^h7560], MENE[^h4484], MENE[^h4484], TEKEL[^h8625], UPHARSIN[^h6537].
###### 26
This[^h1836] is the interpretation[^h6591] of the thing[^h4406]: MENE[^h4484]; God[^h426] hath numbered[^h4483] thy kingdom[^h4437], and finished[^h8000] it.
###### 27
TEKEL[^h8625]; Thou art weighed[^h8625] in the balances[^h3977], and art found[^h7912] wanting[^h2627].
###### 28
PERES[^h6537]; Thy kingdom[^h4437] is divided[^h6537], and given[^h3052] to the Medes[^h4076] and Persians[^h6540].
###### 29
Then[^h116] commanded[^h560] Belshazzar[^h1113], and they clothed[^h3848] Daniel[^h1841] with scarlet[^h711], and put a chain[^h2002] of gold[^h1722] about[^h5922] his neck[^h6676], and made a proclamation[^h3745] concerning[^h5922] him, that he should be[^h1934] the third[^h8531] ruler[^h7990] in the kingdom[^h4437].
###### 30
In that night[^h3916] was Belshazzar[^h1113] the king[^h4430] of the Chaldeans[^h3779] slain[^h6992].
###### 31
And Darius[^h1868] the Median[^h4077] took[^h6902] the kingdom[^h4437], being about threescore[^h8361] and two[^h8648] years[^h8140] old[^h1247].

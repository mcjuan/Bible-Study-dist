###### 1
Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] the king[^h4430], unto all[^h3606] people[^h5972], nations[^h524], and languages[^h3961], that dwell[^h1753] in all[^h3606] the earth[^h772]; Peace[^h8001] be multiplied[^h7680] unto you.
###### 2
I thought[^h6925] it good[^h8232] to shew[^h2324] the signs[^h852] and wonders[^h8540] that the high[^h5943] God[^h426] hath wrought[^h5648] toward[^h5974] me. 
###### 3
How[^h4101] great[^h7260] are his signs[^h852]! and how[^h4101] mighty[^h8624] are his wonders[^h8540]! his kingdom[^h4437] is an everlasting[^h5957] kingdom[^h4437], and his dominion[^h7985] is from[^h5974] generation[^h1859] to generation[^h1859].
###### 4
I[^h576] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] was[^h1934] at rest[^h7954] in mine house[^h1005], and flourishing[^h7487] in my palace[^h1965]:
###### 5
I saw[^h2370] a dream[^h2493] which made me afraid[^h1763], and the thoughts[^h2031] upon[^h5922] my bed[^h4903] and the visions[^h2376] of my head[^h7217] troubled[^h927] me.
###### 6
Therefore[^h4481] made[^h7761] I[^h4481] a decree[^h2942] to bring[^h5954] in all[^h3606] the wise[^h2445] men of Babylon[^h895] before[^h6925] me, that they might make known[^h3046] unto me the interpretation[^h6591] of the dream[^h2493].
###### 7
Then[^h116] came[^h5954] in the magicians[^h2749], the astrologers[^h826], the Chaldeans[^h3779], and the soothsayers[^h1505]: and I[^h576] told[^h560] the dream[^h2493] before[^h6925] them; but they did not[^h3809] make known[^h3046] unto me the interpretation[^h6591] thereof.
###### 8
But at[^h5705] the last[^h318] Daniel[^h1841] came in[^h5922] before me[^h6925], whose name[^h8036] was Belteshazzar[^h1096], according to the name[^h8036] of my god[^h426], and in whom is the spirit[^h7308] of the holy[^h6922] gods[^h426]: and before[^h6925] him I told[^h560] the dream[^h2493], saying,
###### 9
O Belteshazzar[^h1096], master[^h7229] of the magicians[^h2749], because I[^h576] know[^h3046] that the spirit[^h7308] of the holy[^h6922] gods[^h426] is in thee, and no[^h3606] [^h3809] secret[^h7328] troubleth[^h598] thee, tell[^h560] me the visions[^h2376] of my dream[^h2493] that I have seen[^h2370], and the interpretation[^h6591] thereof.
###### 10
Thus were the visions[^h2376] of mine head[^h7217] in[^h5922] my bed[^h4903]; I saw[^h1934] [^h2370], and behold[^h431] a tree[^h363] in the midst[^h1459] of the earth[^h772], and the height[^h7314] thereof was great[^h7690]. 
###### 11
The tree[^h363] grew[^h7236], and was strong[^h8631], and the height[^h7314] thereof reached[^h4291] unto heaven[^h8065], and the sight[^h2379] thereof to the end[^h5491] of all[^h3606] the earth[^h772]:
###### 12
The leaves[^h6074] thereof were fair[^h8209], and the fruit[^h4] thereof much[^h7690], and in it was meat[^h4203] for all[^h3606]: the beasts[^h2423] of the field[^h1251] had shadow[^h2927] under[^h8460] it, and the fowls[^h6853] of the heaven[^h8065] dwelt[^h1753] in the boughs[^h6056] thereof, and all[^h3606] flesh[^h1321] was fed[^h2110] of it[^h4481].
###### 13
I saw[^h1934] [^h2370] in the visions[^h2376] of my head[^h7217] upon[^h5922] my bed[^h4903], and, behold[^h431], a watcher[^h5894] and an holy one[^h6922] came down[^h5182] from[^h4481] heaven[^h8065];
###### 14
He cried[^h7123] aloud[^h2429], and said[^h560] thus[^h3652], Hew down[^h1414] the tree[^h363], and cut off[^h7113] his branches[^h6056], shake off[^h5426] his leaves[^h6074], and scatter[^h921] his fruit[^h4]: let the beasts[^h2423] get away[^h5111] from[^h4481] under it[^h8479], and the fowls[^h6853] from[^h4481] his branches[^h6056]: 
###### 15
Nevertheless[^h1297] leave[^h7662] the stump[^h6136] of his roots[^h8330] in the earth[^h772], even with a band[^h613] of iron[^h6523] and brass[^h5174], in the tender grass[^h1883] of the field[^h1251]; and let it be wet[^h6647] with the dew[^h2920] of heaven[^h8065], and let his portion[^h2508] be with[^h5974] the beasts[^h2423] in the grass[^h6211] of the earth[^h772]:
###### 16
Let his heart[^h3825] be changed[^h8133] from[^h4481] man's[^h606], and let a beast's[^h2423] heart[^h3825] be given[^h3052] unto him; and let seven[^h7655] times[^h5732] pass[^h2499] over[^h5922] him.
###### 17
This matter[^h6600] is by the decree[^h1510] of the watchers[^h5894], and the demand[^h7595] by the word[^h3983] of the holy ones[^h6922]: to[^h5705] the intent[^h1701] that the living[^h2417] may know[^h3046] that the most High[^h5943] ruleth[^h7990] in the kingdom[^h4437] of men[^h606], and giveth[^h5415] it to whomsoever[^h4479] he will[^h6634], and setteth up[^h6966] over[^h5922] it the basest[^h8215] of men[^h606].
###### 18
This[^h1836] dream[^h2493] I[^h576] king[^h4430] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] have seen[^h2370]. Now thou[^h607], O Belteshazzar[^h1096], declare[^h560] the interpretation[^h6591] thereof, forasmuch as[^h6903] all[^h3606] the wise[^h2445] men of my kingdom[^h4437] are not[^h3809] able[^h3202] to make known[^h3046] unto me the interpretation[^h6591]: but thou[^h607] art able[^h3546]; for the spirit[^h7308] of the holy[^h6922] gods[^h426] is in thee.
###### 19
Then[^h116] Daniel[^h1841], whose name[^h8036] was Belteshazzar[^h1096], was astonied[^h8075] for one[^h2298] hour[^h8160], and his thoughts[^h7476] troubled[^h927] him. The king[^h4430] spake[^h6032], and said[^h560], Belteshazzar[^h1096], let not[^h409] the dream[^h2493], or the interpretation[^h6591] thereof, trouble[^h927] thee. Belteshazzar[^h1096] answered[^h6032] and said[^h560], My lord[^h4756], the dream[^h2493] be to them that hate[^h8131] thee, and the interpretation[^h6591] thereof to thine enemies[^h6146].
###### 20
The tree[^h363] that thou sawest[^h2370], which grew[^h7236], and was strong[^h8631], whose height[^h7314] reached[^h4291] unto the heaven[^h8065], and the sight[^h2379] thereof to all[^h3606] the earth[^h772];
###### 21
Whose leaves[^h6074] were fair[^h8209], and the fruit[^h4] thereof much[^h7690], and in it was meat[^h4203] for all[^h3606]; under[^h8460] which the beasts[^h2423] of the field[^h1251] dwelt[^h1753], and upon whose branches[^h6056] the fowls[^h6853] of the heaven[^h8065] had their habitation[^h7932]:
###### 22
It is thou[^h607], O king[^h4430], that art grown[^h7236] and become strong[^h8631]: for thy greatness[^h7238] is grown[^h7236], and reacheth[^h4291] unto heaven[^h8065], and thy dominion[^h7985] to the end[^h5491] of the earth[^h772].
###### 23
And whereas the king[^h4430] saw[^h2370] a watcher[^h5894] and an holy one[^h6922] coming down[^h5182] from[^h4481] heaven[^h8065], and saying[^h560], Hew[^h1414] the tree[^h363] down[^h1414], and destroy[^h2255] it; yet[^h1297] leave[^h7662] the stump[^h6136] of the roots[^h8330] thereof in the earth[^h772], even with a band[^h613] of iron[^h6523] and brass[^h5174], in the tender grass[^h1883] of the field[^h1251]; and let it be wet[^h6647] with the dew[^h2920] of heaven[^h8065], and let his portion[^h2508] be with[^h5974] the beasts[^h2423] of the field[^h1251], till[^h5705] seven[^h7655] times[^h5732] pass[^h2499] over[^h5922] him;
###### 24
This[^h1836] is the interpretation[^h6591], O king[^h4430], and this[^h1932] is the decree[^h1510] of the most High[^h5943], which is come[^h4291] upon[^h5922] my lord[^h4756] the king[^h4430]:
###### 25
That they shall drive[^h2957] thee from[^h4481] men[^h606], and thy dwelling[^h4070] shall be[^h1934] with[^h5974] the beasts[^h2423] of the field[^h1251], and they shall make thee to eat[^h2939] grass[^h6211] as oxen[^h8450], and they shall wet[^h6647] thee with the dew[^h2920] of heaven[^h8065], and seven[^h7655] times[^h5732] shall pass[^h2499] over[^h5922] thee, till[^h5705] thou know[^h3046] that the most High[^h5943] ruleth[^h7990] in the kingdom[^h4437] of men[^h606], and giveth[^h5415] it to whomsoever[^h4479] he will[^h6634].
###### 26
And whereas they commanded[^h560] to leave[^h7662] the stump[^h6136] of the tree[^h363] roots[^h8330]; thy kingdom[^h4437] shall be sure[^h7011] unto thee, after[^h4481] that thou shalt have known[^h3046] that the heavens[^h8065] do rule[^h7990].
###### 27
Wherefore[^h3861], O king[^h4430], let my counsel[^h4431] be acceptable[^h8232] unto thee[^h5922], and break off[^h6562] thy sins[^h2408] by righteousness[^h6665], and thine iniquities[^h5758] by shewing mercy[^h2604] to the poor[^h6033]; if[^h2006] it may be[^h1934] a lengthening[^h754] of thy tranquillity[^h7963]. 
###### 28
All[^h3606] this came[^h4291] upon[^h5922] the king[^h4430] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020].
###### 29
At the end[^h7118] of twelve[^h8648] [^h6236] months[^h3393] he walked[^h1934] [^h1981] in[^h5922] the palace[^h1965] of the kingdom[^h4437] of Babylon[^h895]. 
###### 30
The king[^h4430] spake[^h6032], and said[^h560], Is not[^h3809] this[^h1932] [^h1668] great[^h7229] Babylon[^h895], that I[^h576] have built[^h1124] for the house[^h1005] of the kingdom[^h4437] by the might[^h8632] of my power[^h2632], and for the honour[^h3367] of my majesty[^h1923]?
###### 31
While[^h5751] the word[^h4406] was in the king's[^h4430] mouth[^h6433], there fell[^h5308] a voice[^h7032] from[^h4481] heaven[^h8065], saying, O king[^h4430] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020], to thee it is spoken[^h560]; The kingdom[^h4437] is departed[^h5709] from[^h4481] thee.
###### 32
And they shall drive[^h2957] thee from[^h4481] men[^h606], and thy dwelling[^h4070] shall be with[^h5974] the beasts[^h2423] of the field[^h1251]: they shall make thee to eat[^h2939] grass[^h6211] as oxen[^h8450], and seven[^h7655] times[^h5732] shall pass[^h2499] over[^h5922] thee, until[^h5705] thou know[^h3046] that the most High[^h5943] ruleth[^h7990] in the kingdom[^h4437] of men[^h606], and giveth[^h5415] it to whomsoever[^h4479] he will[^h6634].
###### 33
The same hour[^h8160] was the thing[^h4406] fulfilled[^h5487] upon[^h5922] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020]: and he was driven[^h2957] from[^h4481] men[^h606], and did eat[^h399] grass[^h6211] as oxen[^h8450], and his body[^h1655] was wet[^h6647] with the dew[^h2920] of heaven[^h8065], till[^h5705] his hairs[^h8177] were grown[^h7236] like eagles'[^h5403] feathers, and his nails[^h2953] like birds'[^h6853] claws.
###### 34
And at the end[^h7118] of the days[^h3118] I[^h576] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] lifted up[^h5191] mine eyes[^h5870] unto heaven[^h8065], and mine understanding[^h4486] returned[^h8421] unto me[^h5922], and I blessed[^h1289] the most High[^h5943], and I praised[^h7624] and honoured[^h1922] him that liveth[^h2417] for ever[^h5957], whose dominion[^h7985] is an everlasting[^h5957] dominion[^h7985], and his kingdom[^h4437] is from[^h5974] generation[^h1859] to generation[^h1859]:
###### 35
And all[^h3606] the inhabitants[^h1753] of the earth[^h772] are reputed[^h2804] as nothing[^h3809]: and he doeth[^h5648] according to his will[^h6634] in the army[^h2429] of heaven[^h8065], and among the inhabitants[^h1753] of the earth[^h772]: and none[^h3809] can[^h383] stay[^h4223] his hand[^h3028], or say[^h560] unto him, What[^h4101] doest[^h5648] thou?
###### 36
At the same time[^h2166] my reason[^h4486] returned[^h8421] unto me[^h5922]; and for the glory[^h3367] of my kingdom[^h4437], mine honour[^h1923] and brightness[^h2122] returned[^h8421] unto me[^h5922]; and my counsellors[^h1907] and my lords[^h7261] sought[^h1156] unto me[^h5922]; and I was established[^h8627] in my kingdom[^h4437], and excellent[^h3493] majesty[^h7238] was added[^h3255] unto me.
###### 37
Now[^h3705] I[^h576] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5020] praise[^h7624] and extol[^h7313] and honour[^h1922] the King[^h4430] of heaven[^h8065], all[^h3606] whose works[^h4567] are truth[^h7187], and his ways[^h735] judgment[^h1780]: and those that walk[^h1981] in pride[^h1467] he is able[^h3202] to abase[^h8214].

###### 1
In the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] came[^h935] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019] king[^h4428] of Babylon[^h894] unto Jerusalem[^h3389], and besieged[^h6696] it.
###### 2
And the Lord[^h136] gave[^h5414] Jehoiakim[^h3079] king[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] into his hand[^h3027], with part[^h7117] of the vessels[^h3627] of the house[^h1004] of God[^h430]: which he carried[^h935] into the land[^h776] of Shinar[^h8152] to the house[^h1004] of his god[^h430]; and he brought[^h935] the vessels[^h3627] into the treasure[^h214] house[^h1004] of his god[^h430].
###### 3
And the king[^h4428] spake[^h559] unto Ashpenaz[^h828] the master[^h7227] of his eunuchs[^h5631], that he should bring[^h935] certain of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], and of the king's[^h4410] seed[^h2233], and of the princes[^h6579];
###### 4
Children[^h3206] in whom was no blemish[^h3971] [^h3971], but well[^h2896] favoured[^h4758], and skilful[^h7919] in all wisdom[^h2451], and cunning[^h3045] in knowledge[^h1847], and understanding[^h995] science[^h4093], and such as had ability[^h3581] in them to stand[^h5975] in the king's[^h4428] palace[^h1964], and whom they might teach[^h3925] the learning[^h5612] and the tongue[^h3956] of the Chaldeans[^h3778].
###### 5
And the king[^h4428] appointed[^h4487] them a daily[^h3117] [^h3117] provision[^h1697] of the king's[^h4428] meat[^h6598], and of the wine[^h3196] which he drank[^h4960]: so nourishing[^h1431] them three[^h7969] years[^h8141], that at the end[^h7117] thereof they might stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 6
Now among these were of the children[^h1121] of Judah[^h3063], Daniel[^h1840], Hananiah[^h2608], Mishael[^h4332], and Azariah[^h5838]:
###### 7
Unto whom the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631] gave[^h7760] names[^h8034]: for he gave[^h7760] unto Daniel[^h1840] the name of Belteshazzar[^h1095]; and to Hananiah[^h2608], of Shadrach[^h7714]; and to Mishael[^h4332], of Meshach[^h4335]; and to Azariah[^h5838], of Abednego[^h5664].
###### 8
But Daniel[^h1840] purposed[^h7760] in his heart[^h3820] that he would not defile[^h1351] himself with the portion[^h6598] of the king's[^h4428] meat[^h6598], nor with the wine[^h3196] which he drank[^h4960]: therefore he requested[^h1245] of the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631] that he might not defile[^h1351] himself.
###### 9
Now God[^h430] had brought[^h5414] Daniel[^h1840] into favour[^h2617] and tender love[^h7356] with[^h6440] the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631].
###### 10
And the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631] said[^h559] unto Daniel[^h1840], I fear[^h3373] my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428], who hath appointed[^h4487] your meat[^h3978] and your drink[^h4960]: for why should he see[^h7200] your faces[^h6440] worse liking[^h2196] than the children[^h3206] which are of your sort[^h1524]? then shall ye make me endanger[^h2325] my head[^h7218] to the king[^h4428].  
###### 11
Then said[^h559] Daniel[^h1840] to Melzar[^h4453], whom the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631] had set[^h4487] over Daniel[^h1840], Hananiah[^h2608], Mishael[^h4332], and Azariah[^h5838], 
###### 12
Prove[^h5254] thy servants[^h5650], I beseech thee, ten[^h6235] days[^h3117]; and let them give[^h5414] us pulse[^h2235] to eat[^h398], and water[^h4325] to drink[^h8354].  
###### 13
Then let our countenances[^h4758] be looked upon[^h7200] before[^h6440] thee, and the countenance[^h4758] of the children[^h3206] that eat[^h398] of the portion[^h6598] of the king's[^h4428] meat[^h6598]: and as thou seest[^h7200], deal[^h6213] with thy servants[^h5650].
###### 14
So he consented[^h8085] to them in this matter[^h1697], and proved[^h5254] them ten[^h6235] days[^h3117].
###### 15
And at the end[^h7117] of ten[^h6235] days[^h3117] their countenances[^h4758] appeared[^h7200] fairer[^h2896] and fatter[^h1277] in flesh[^h1320] than all the children[^h3206] which did eat[^h398] the portion[^h6598] of the king's[^h4428] meat[^h6598].
###### 16
Thus Melzar[^h4453] took away[^h5375] the portion of their meat[^h6598], and the wine[^h3196] that they should drink[^h4960]; and gave[^h5414] them pulse[^h2235].
###### 17
As for these four[^h702] children[^h3206], God[^h430] gave[^h5414] them knowledge[^h4093] and skill[^h7919] in all learning[^h5612] and wisdom[^h2451]: and Daniel[^h1840] had understanding[^h995] in all visions[^h2377] and dreams[^h2472]. 
###### 18
Now at the end[^h7117] of the days[^h3117] that the king[^h4428] had said[^h559] he should bring[^h935] them in, then the prince[^h8269] of the eunuchs[^h5631] brought[^h935] them in before[^h6440] Nebuchadnezzar[^h5019].
###### 19
And the king[^h4428] communed[^h1696] with them; and among them all was found[^h4672] none like Daniel[^h1840], Hananiah[^h2608], Mishael[^h4332], and Azariah[^h5838]: therefore stood[^h5975] they before[^h6440] the king[^h4428].
###### 20
And in all matters[^h1697] of wisdom[^h2451] and understanding[^h998], that the king[^h4428] enquired[^h1245] of them, he found[^h4672] them ten times[^h6235] better[^h3027] than all the magicians[^h2748] and astrologers[^h825] that were in all his realm[^h4438]. 
###### 21
And Daniel[^h1840] continued even unto the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of king[^h4428] Cyrus[^h3566].

###### 1
In the third[^h7969] year[^h8141] of the reign[^h4438] of king[^h4428] Belshazzar[^h1112] a vision[^h2377] appeared[^h7200] unto me, even unto me Daniel[^h1840], after[^h310] that which appeared[^h7200] unto me at the first[^h8462].
###### 2
And I saw[^h7200] in a vision[^h2377]; and it came to pass, when I saw[^h7200], that I was at Shushan[^h7800] in the palace[^h1002], which is in the province[^h4082] of Elam[^h5867]; and I saw[^h7200] in a vision[^h2377], and I was by the river[^h180] of Ulai[^h195].
###### 3
Then I lifted up[^h5375] mine eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200], and, behold, there stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] the river[^h180] a[^h259] ram[^h352] which had two horns[^h7161]: and the two horns[^h7161] were high[^h1364]; but one[^h259] was higher[^h1364] than the other[^h8145], and the higher[^h1364] came up[^h5927] last[^h314]. 
###### 4
I saw[^h7200] the ram[^h352] pushing[^h5055] westward[^h3220], and northward[^h6828], and southward[^h5045]; so that no beasts[^h2416] might stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] him, neither was there any that could deliver[^h5337] out of his hand[^h3027]; but he did[^h6213] according to his will[^h7522], and became great[^h1431].
###### 5
And as I was considering[^h995], behold, an he[^h5795] goat[^h6842] came[^h935] from the west[^h4628] on the face[^h6440] of the whole earth[^h776], and touched[^h5060] not the ground[^h776]: and the goat[^h6842] had a notable[^h2380] horn[^h7161] between his eyes[^h5869].  
###### 6
And he came[^h935] to the ram[^h352] that had[^h1167] two horns[^h7161], which I had seen[^h7200] standing[^h5975] before[^h6440] the river[^h180], and ran[^h7323] unto him in the fury[^h2534] of his power[^h3581].
###### 7
And I saw[^h7200] him come[^h5060] close unto[^h681] the ram[^h352], and he was moved with choler[^h4843] against him, and smote[^h5221] the ram[^h352], and brake[^h7665] his two[^h8147] horns[^h7161]: and there was no power[^h3581] in the ram[^h352] to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] him, but he cast him down[^h7993] to the ground[^h776], and stamped[^h7429] upon him: and there was none that could deliver[^h5337] the ram[^h352] out of his hand[^h3027].
###### 8
Therefore the he[^h6842] goat[^h5795] waxed very[^h3966] great[^h1431]: and when he was strong[^h6105], the great[^h1419] horn[^h7161] was broken[^h7665]; and for it came up[^h5927] four[^h702] notable ones[^h2380] toward the four[^h702] winds[^h7307] of heaven[^h8064].
###### 9
And out of one[^h259] of them came forth[^h3318] a little[^h4704] horn[^h7161], which waxed exceeding[^h3499] great[^h1431], toward the south[^h5045], and toward the east[^h4217], and toward the pleasant[^h6643] land.
###### 10
And it waxed great[^h1431], even to the host[^h6635] of heaven[^h8064]; and it cast down[^h5307] some of the host[^h6635] and of the stars[^h3556] to the ground[^h776], and stamped[^h7429] upon them. 
###### 11
Yea, he magnified[^h1431] himself even to the prince[^h8269] of the host[^h6635], and by him the daily[^h8548] sacrifice was taken away[^h7311] [^h7311], and the place[^h4349] of his sanctuary[^h4720] was cast down[^h7993].  
###### 12
And an host[^h6635] was given[^h5414] him against the daily[^h8548] sacrifice by reason of transgression[^h6588], and it cast down[^h7993] the truth[^h571] to the ground[^h776]; and it practised[^h6213], and prospered[^h6743]. 
###### 13
Then I heard[^h8085] one[^h259] saint[^h6918] speaking[^h1696], and another[^h259] saint[^h6918] said[^h559] unto that certain[^h6422] saint which spake[^h1696], How long shall be the vision[^h2377] concerning the daily[^h8548] sacrifice, and the transgression[^h6588] of desolation[^h8074], to give[^h5414] both the sanctuary[^h6944] and the host[^h6635] to be trodden under foot[^h4823]?  
###### 14
And he said[^h559] unto me, Unto two thousand[^h505] and three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] days[^h6153] [^h1242]; then shall the sanctuary[^h6944] be cleansed[^h6663].  
###### 15
And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel[^h1840], had seen[^h7200] the vision[^h2377], and sought[^h1245] for the meaning[^h998], then, behold, there stood[^h5975] before me as the appearance[^h4758] of a man[^h1397].
###### 16
And I heard[^h8085] a man's[^h120] voice[^h6963] between the banks of Ulai[^h195], which called[^h7121], and said[^h559], Gabriel[^h1403], make this[^h1975] man to understand[^h995] the vision[^h4758].
###### 17
So he came[^h935] near[^h681] where I stood[^h5977]: and when he came[^h935], I was afraid[^h1204], and fell[^h5307] upon my face[^h6440]: but he said[^h559] unto me, Understand[^h995], O son[^h1121] of man[^h120]: for at the time[^h6256] of the end[^h7093] shall be the vision[^h2377].
###### 18
Now as he was speaking[^h1696] with me, I was in a deep sleep[^h7290] on my face[^h6440] toward the ground[^h776]: but he touched[^h5060] me, and set[^h5975] me upright[^h5977]. 
###### 19
And he said[^h559], Behold, I will make thee know[^h3045] what shall be in the last end[^h319] of the indignation[^h2195]: for at the time appointed[^h4150] the end[^h7093] shall be.
###### 20
The ram[^h352] which thou sawest[^h7200] having[^h1167] two horns[^h7161] are the kings[^h4428] of Media[^h4074] and Persia[^h6539].
###### 21
And the rough[^h8163] goat[^h6842] is the king[^h4428] of Grecia[^h3120]: and the great[^h1419] horn[^h7161] that is between his eyes[^h5869] is the first[^h7223] king[^h4428].
###### 22
Now that being broken[^h7665], whereas four[^h702] stood up[^h5975] for it, four[^h702] kingdoms[^h4438] shall stand up[^h5975] out of the nation[^h1471], but not in his power[^h3581].
###### 23
And in the latter time[^h319] of their kingdom[^h4438], when the transgressors[^h6586] are come to the full[^h8552], a king[^h4428] of fierce[^h5794] countenance[^h6440], and understanding[^h995] dark sentences[^h2420], shall stand up[^h5975]. 
###### 24
And his power[^h3581] shall be mighty[^h6105], but not by his own power[^h3581]: and he shall destroy[^h7843] wonderfully[^h6381], and shall prosper[^h6743], and practise[^h6213], and shall destroy[^h7843] the mighty[^h6099] and the holy[^h6918] people[^h5971]. 
###### 25
And through his policy[^h7922] also he shall cause craft[^h4820] to prosper[^h6743] in his hand[^h3027]; and he shall magnify[^h1431] himself in his heart[^h3824], and by peace[^h7962] shall destroy[^h7843] many[^h7227]: he shall also stand up[^h5975] against the Prince[^h8269] of princes[^h8269]; but he shall be broken[^h7665] without[^h657] hand[^h3027]. 
###### 26
And the vision[^h4758] of the evening[^h6153] and the morning[^h1242] which was told[^h559] is true[^h571]: wherefore shut thou up[^h5640] the vision[^h2377]; for it shall be for many[^h7227] days[^h3117].
###### 27
And I Daniel[^h1840] fainted[^h1961], and was sick[^h2470] certain days[^h3117]; afterward I rose up[^h6965], and did[^h6213] the king's[^h4428] business[^h4399]; and I was astonished[^h8074] at the vision[^h4758], but none understood[^h995] it.

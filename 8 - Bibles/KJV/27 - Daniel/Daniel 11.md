###### 1
Also I in the first[^h259] year[^h8141] of Darius[^h1867] the Mede[^h4075], even I, stood[^h5977] to confirm[^h2388] and to strengthen[^h4581] him.
###### 2
And now will I shew[^h5046] thee the truth[^h571]. Behold, there shall stand up[^h5975] yet three[^h7969] kings[^h4428] in Persia[^h6539]; and the fourth[^h7243] shall be far[^h6239] richer[^h6238] than they all[^h1419]: and by his strength[^h2393] through his riches[^h6239] he shall stir up[^h5782] all against the realm[^h4438] of Grecia[^h3120].
###### 3
And a mighty[^h1368] king[^h4428] shall stand up[^h5975], that shall rule[^h4910] with great[^h7227] dominion[^h4474], and do[^h6213] according to his will[^h7522].
###### 4
And when he shall stand up[^h5975], his kingdom[^h4438] shall be broken[^h7665], and shall be divided[^h2673] toward the four[^h702] winds[^h7307] of heaven[^h8064]; and not to his posterity[^h319], nor according to his dominion[^h4915] which he ruled[^h4910]: for his kingdom[^h4438] shall be plucked up[^h5428], even for others[^h312] beside those.
###### 5
And the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] shall be strong[^h2388], and one of his princes[^h8269]; and he shall be strong[^h2388] above him, and have dominion[^h4910]; his dominion[^h4475] shall be a great[^h7227] dominion[^h4474].
###### 6
And in the end[^h7093] of years[^h8141] they shall join themselves together[^h2266]; for the king's[^h4428] daughter[^h1323] of the south[^h5045] shall come[^h935] to the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828] to make[^h6213] an agreement[^h4339]: but she shall not retain[^h6113] the power[^h3581] of the arm[^h2220]; neither shall he stand[^h5975], nor his arm[^h2220]: but she shall be given up[^h5414], and they that brought[^h935] her, and he that begat[^h3205] her, and he that strengthened[^h2388] her in these times[^h6256].   
###### 7
But out of a branch[^h5342] of her roots[^h8328] shall one stand up[^h5975] in his estate[^h3653], which shall come[^h935] with an army[^h2428], and shall enter[^h935] into the fortress[^h4581] of the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828], and shall deal[^h6213] against them, and shall prevail[^h2388]: 
###### 8
And shall also carry[^h935] captives[^h7628] into Egypt[^h4714] their gods[^h430], with their princes[^h5257], and with their precious[^h2532] vessels[^h3627] of silver[^h3701] and of gold[^h2091]; and he shall continue[^h5975] more years[^h8141] than the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828]. 
###### 9
So the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] shall come[^h935] into his kingdom[^h4438], and shall return[^h7725] into his own land[^h127].
###### 10
But his sons[^h1121] shall be stirred up[^h1624], and shall assemble[^h622] a multitude[^h1995] of great[^h7227] forces[^h2428]: and one shall certainly[^h935] come[^h935], and overflow[^h7857], and pass through[^h5674]: then shall he return[^h7725], and be stirred up[^h1624], even to his fortress[^h4581].  
###### 11
And the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] shall be moved with choler[^h4843], and shall come forth[^h3318] and fight[^h3898] with him, even with the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828]: and he shall set forth[^h5975] a great[^h7227] multitude[^h1995]; but the multitude[^h1995] shall be given[^h5414] into his hand[^h3027].
###### 12
And when he hath taken away[^h5375] the multitude[^h1995], his heart[^h3824] shall be lifted up[^h7311] [^h7311]; and he shall cast down[^h5307] many ten thousands[^h7239]: but he shall not be strengthened[^h5810] by it.
###### 13
For the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828] shall return[^h7725], and shall set forth[^h5975] a multitude[^h1995] greater[^h7227] than the former[^h7223], and shall certainly[^h935] come[^h935] after[^h7093] certain[^h6256] years[^h8141] with a great[^h1419] army[^h2428] and with much[^h7227] riches[^h7399]. 
###### 14
And in those times[^h6256] there shall many[^h7227] stand up[^h5975] against the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045]: also the robbers[^h1121] [^h6530] of thy people[^h5971] shall exalt[^h5375] themselves to establish[^h5975] the vision[^h2377]; but they shall fall[^h3782]. 
###### 15
So the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828] shall come[^h935], and cast up[^h8210] a mount[^h5550], and take[^h3920] the most fenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892]: and the arms[^h2220] of the south[^h5045] shall not withstand[^h5975], neither his chosen[^h4005] people[^h5971], neither shall there be any strength[^h3581] to withstand[^h5975].  
###### 16
But he that cometh[^h935] against him shall do[^h6213] according to his own will[^h7522], and none shall stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] him: and he shall stand[^h5975] in the glorious[^h6643] land[^h776], which by his hand[^h3027] shall be consumed[^h3617]. 
###### 17
He shall also set[^h7760] his face[^h6440] to enter[^h935] with the strength[^h8633] of his whole kingdom[^h4438], and upright ones[^h3477] with him; thus shall he do[^h6213]: and he shall give[^h5414] him the daughter[^h1323] of women[^h802], corrupting[^h7843] her: but she shall not stand[^h5975] on his side, neither be for him.  
###### 18
After this shall he turn[^h7760] [^h7725] his face[^h6440] unto the isles[^h339], and shall take[^h3920] many[^h7227]: but a prince[^h7101] for his own behalf shall cause the reproach[^h2781] offered by him to cease[^h7673]; without[^h1115] his own reproach[^h2781] he shall cause it to turn[^h7725] upon him.  
###### 19
Then he shall turn[^h7725] his face[^h6440] toward the fort[^h4581] of his own land[^h776]: but he shall stumble[^h3782] and fall[^h5307], and not be found[^h4672].
###### 20
Then shall stand up[^h5975] in his estate[^h3653] a raiser[^h5674] of taxes[^h5065] in the glory[^h1925] of the kingdom[^h4438]: but within few[^h259] days[^h3117] he shall be destroyed[^h7665], neither in anger[^h639], nor in battle[^h4421].   
###### 21
And in his estate[^h3653] shall stand up[^h5975] a vile person[^h959], to whom they shall not give[^h5414] the honour[^h1935] of the kingdom[^h4438]: but he shall come[^h935] in peaceably[^h7962], and obtain[^h2388] the kingdom[^h4438] by flatteries[^h2519]. 
###### 22
And with the arms[^h2220] of a flood[^h7858] shall they be overflown[^h7857] from before[^h6440] him, and shall be broken[^h7665]; yea, also the prince[^h5057] of the covenant[^h1285].
###### 23
And after the league[^h2266] made with him he shall work[^h6213] deceitfully[^h4820]: for he shall come up[^h5927], and shall become strong[^h6105] with a small[^h4592] people[^h1471].
###### 24
He shall enter[^h935] peaceably[^h7962] even upon the fattest places[^h4924] of the province[^h4082]; and he shall do[^h6213] that which his fathers[^h1] have not done[^h6213], nor his fathers'[^h1] fathers[^h1]; he shall scatter[^h967] among them the prey[^h961], and spoil[^h7998], and riches[^h7399]: yea, and he shall forecast[^h2803] his devices[^h4284] against the strong holds[^h4013], even for a time[^h6256].  
###### 25
And he shall stir up[^h5782] his power[^h3581] and his courage[^h3824] against the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] with a great[^h1419] army[^h2428]; and the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] shall be stirred up[^h1624] to battle[^h4421] with a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] and mighty[^h6099] army[^h2428]; but he shall not stand[^h5975]: for they shall forecast[^h2803] devices[^h4284] against him.
###### 26
Yea, they that feed[^h398] of the portion of his meat[^h6598] shall destroy[^h7665] him, and his army[^h2428] shall overflow[^h7857]: and many[^h7227] shall fall[^h5307] down slain[^h2491].
###### 27
And both[^h8147] these kings'[^h4428] hearts[^h3824] shall be to do mischief[^h4827] [^h7451], and they shall speak[^h1696] lies[^h3577] at one[^h259] table[^h7979]; but it shall not prosper[^h6743]: for yet the end[^h7093] shall be at the time appointed[^h4150]. 
###### 28
Then shall he return[^h7725] into his land[^h776] with great[^h1419] riches[^h7399]; and his heart[^h3824] shall be against the holy[^h6944] covenant[^h1285]; and he shall do[^h6213] exploits, and return[^h7725] to his own land[^h776].
###### 29
At the time appointed[^h4150] he shall return[^h7725], and come[^h935] toward the south[^h5045]; but it shall not be as the former[^h7223], or as the latter[^h314].
###### 30
For the ships[^h6716] of Chittim[^h3794] shall come[^h935] against him: therefore he shall be grieved[^h3512], and return[^h7725], and have indignation[^h2194] against the holy[^h6944] covenant[^h1285]: so shall he do[^h6213]; he shall even return[^h7725], and have intelligence[^h995] with them that forsake[^h5800] the holy[^h6944] covenant[^h1285].
###### 31
And arms[^h2220] shall stand[^h5975] on his part, and they shall pollute[^h2490] the sanctuary[^h4720] of strength[^h4581], and shall take away[^h5493] the daily[^h8548] sacrifice, and they shall place[^h5414] the abomination[^h8251] that maketh desolate[^h8074]. 
###### 32
And such as do wickedly[^h7561] against the covenant[^h1285] shall he corrupt[^h2610] by flatteries[^h2514]: but the people[^h5971] that do know[^h3045] their God[^h430] shall be strong[^h2388], and do[^h6213] exploits. 
###### 33
And they that understand[^h7919] among the people[^h5971] shall instruct[^h995] many[^h7227]: yet they shall fall[^h3782] by the sword[^h2719], and by flame[^h3852], by captivity[^h7628], and by spoil[^h961], many days[^h3117].
###### 34
Now when they shall fall[^h3782], they shall be holpen[^h5826] with a little[^h4592] help[^h5828]: but many[^h7227] shall cleave[^h3867] to them with flatteries[^h2519].
###### 35
And some of them of understanding[^h7919] shall fall[^h3782], to try[^h6884] them, and to purge[^h1305], and to make them white[^h3835], even to the time[^h6256] of the end[^h7093]: because it is yet for a time appointed[^h4150]. 
###### 36
And the king[^h4428] shall do[^h6213] according to his will[^h7522]; and he shall exalt[^h7311] himself, and magnify[^h1431] himself above every god[^h410], and shall speak[^h1696] marvellous things[^h6381] against the God[^h410] of gods[^h410], and shall prosper[^h6743] till the indignation[^h2195] be accomplished[^h3615]: for that that is determined[^h2782] shall be done[^h6213].
###### 37
Neither shall he regard[^h995] the God[^h430] of his fathers[^h1], nor the desire[^h2532] of women[^h802], nor regard[^h995] any god[^h433]: for he shall magnify[^h1431] himself above all.
###### 38
But in his estate[^h3653] shall he honour[^h3513] the God[^h433] of forces[^h4581]: and a god[^h433] whom his fathers[^h1] knew[^h3045] not shall he honour[^h3513] with gold[^h2091], and silver[^h3701], and with precious[^h3368] stones[^h68], and pleasant things[^h2532].  
###### 39
Thus shall he do[^h6213] in the most strong[^h4581] holds[^h4013] with a strange[^h5236] god[^h433], whom he shall acknowledge[^h5234] [^h5234] and increase[^h7235] with glory[^h3519]: and he shall cause them to rule[^h4910] over many[^h7227], and shall divide[^h2505] the land[^h127] for gain[^h4242].  
###### 40
And at the time[^h6256] of the end[^h7093] shall the king[^h4428] of the south[^h5045] push[^h5055] at him: and the king[^h4428] of the north[^h6828] shall come against him like a whirlwind[^h8175], with chariots[^h7393], and with horsemen[^h6571], and with many[^h7227] ships[^h591]; and he shall enter[^h935] into the countries[^h776], and shall overflow[^h7857] and pass over[^h5674].
###### 41
He shall enter[^h935] also into the glorious[^h6643] land[^h776], and many[^h7227] countries shall be overthrown[^h3782]: but these shall escape[^h4422] out of his hand[^h3027], even Edom[^h123], and Moab[^h4124], and the chief[^h7225] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983]. 
###### 42
He shall stretch forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] also upon the countries[^h776]: and the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714] shall not escape[^h6413]. 
###### 43
But he shall have power[^h4910] over the treasures[^h4362] of gold[^h2091] and of silver[^h3701], and over all the precious[^h2532] things of Egypt[^h4714]: and the Libyans[^h3864] and the Ethiopians[^h3569] shall be at his steps[^h4703].
###### 44
But tidings[^h8052] out of the east[^h4217] and out of the north[^h6828] shall trouble[^h926] him: therefore he shall go forth[^h3318] with great[^h1419] fury[^h2534] to destroy[^h8045], and utterly to make away[^h2763] many[^h7227].
###### 45
And he shall plant[^h5193] the tabernacles[^h168] of his palace[^h643] between the seas[^h3220] in the glorious[^h6643] holy[^h6944] mountain[^h2022]; yet he shall come[^h935] to his end[^h7093], and none shall help[^h5826] him.

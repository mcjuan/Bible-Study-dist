###### 1
Now there was a certain[^h259] man[^h376] of Ramathaimzophim[^h7436], of mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and his name[^h8034] was Elkanah[^h511], the son[^h1121] of Jeroham[^h3395], the son[^h1121] of Elihu[^h453], the son[^h1121] of Tohu[^h8459], the son[^h1121] of Zuph[^h6689], an Ephrathite[^h673]:
###### 2
And he had two[^h8147] wives[^h802]; the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Hannah[^h2584], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h8145] Peninnah[^h6444]: and Peninnah[^h6444] had children[^h3206], but Hannah[^h2584] had no children[^h3206].
###### 3
And this[^h1931] man[^h376] went up[^h5927] out of his city[^h5892] yearly[^h3117] [^h3117] to worship[^h7812] and to sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635] in Shiloh[^h7887]. And the two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] of Eli[^h5941], Hophni[^h2652] and Phinehas[^h6372], the priests[^h3548] of the LORD[^h3068], were there. 
###### 4
And when the time[^h3117] was that Elkanah[^h511] offered[^h2076], he gave[^h5414] to Peninnah[^h6444] his wife[^h802], and to all her sons[^h1121] and her daughters[^h1323], portions[^h4490]:
###### 5
But unto Hannah[^h2584] he gave[^h5414] a[^h259] worthy[^h639] portion[^h4490]; for he loved[^h157] Hannah[^h2584]: but the LORD[^h3068] had shut up[^h5462] her womb[^h7358]. 
###### 6
And her adversary[^h6869] also provoked[^h3707] her sore[^h3708], for to make her fret[^h7481], because the LORD[^h3068] had shut[^h5462] up[^h1157] her womb[^h7358]. 
###### 7
And as he did[^h6213] so year[^h8141] by year[^h8141], when[^h1767] she went up[^h5927] to the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068], so she provoked[^h3707] her; therefore she wept[^h1058], and did not eat[^h398]. 
###### 8
Then said[^h559] Elkanah[^h511] her husband[^h376] to her, Hannah[^h2584], why weepest[^h1058] thou? and why eatest[^h398] thou not? and why is thy heart[^h3824] grieved[^h3415]? am not I better[^h2896] to thee than ten[^h6235] sons[^h1121]?
###### 9
So Hannah[^h2584] rose up[^h6965] after[^h310] they had eaten[^h398] in Shiloh[^h7887], and after[^h310] they had drunk[^h8354]. Now Eli[^h5941] the priest[^h3548] sat[^h3427] upon a seat[^h3678] by a post[^h4201] of the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 10
And she was in bitterness[^h4751] of soul[^h5315], and prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068], and wept[^h1058] sore[^h1058]. 
###### 11
And she vowed[^h5087] a vow[^h5088], and said[^h559], O LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], if thou wilt indeed[^h7200] look[^h7200] on the affliction[^h6040] of thine handmaid[^h519], and remember[^h2142] me, and not forget[^h7911] thine handmaid[^h519], but wilt give[^h5414] unto thine handmaid[^h519] a man[^h582] child[^h2233], then I will give[^h5414] him unto the LORD[^h3068] all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416], and there shall no razor[^h4177] come[^h5927] upon his head[^h7218]. 
###### 12
And it came to pass, as she continued[^h7235] praying[^h6419] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], that Eli[^h5941] marked[^h8104] her mouth[^h6310]. 
###### 13
Now Hannah[^h2584], she spake[^h1696] in her heart[^h3820]; only her lips[^h8193] moved[^h5128], but her voice[^h6963] was not heard[^h8085]: therefore Eli[^h5941] thought[^h2803] she had been drunken[^h7910].
###### 14
And Eli[^h5941] said[^h559] unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken[^h7937]? put away[^h5493] thy wine[^h3196] from thee.
###### 15
And Hannah[^h2584] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], No, my lord[^h113], I am a woman[^h802] of a sorrowful[^h7186] spirit[^h7307]: I have drunk[^h8354] neither wine[^h3196] nor strong drink[^h7941], but have poured out[^h8210] my soul[^h5315] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 16
Count[^h5414] not thine handmaid[^h519] for[^h6440] a daughter[^h1323] of Belial[^h1100]: for out of the abundance[^h7230] of my complaint[^h7879] and grief[^h3708] have I spoken[^h1696] hitherto. 
###### 17
Then Eli[^h5941] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965]: and the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] grant[^h5414] thee thy petition[^h7596] that thou hast asked[^h7592] of him.
###### 18
And she said[^h559], Let thine handmaid[^h8198] find[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thy sight[^h5869]. So the woman[^h802] went[^h3212] her way[^h1870], and did eat[^h398], and her countenance[^h6440] was no more sad.
###### 19
And they rose up[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242] early[^h7925], and worshipped[^h7812] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and returned[^h7725], and came[^h935] to their house[^h1004] to Ramah[^h7414]: and Elkanah[^h511] knew[^h3045] Hannah[^h2584] his wife[^h802]; and the LORD[^h3068] remembered[^h2142] her.
###### 20
Wherefore it came to pass, when the time[^h3117] was come[^h8622] about after Hannah[^h2584] had conceived[^h2029], that she bare[^h3205] a son[^h1121], and called[^h7121] his name[^h8034] Samuel[^h8050], saying, Because I have asked[^h7592] him of the LORD[^h3068].  
###### 21
And the man[^h376] Elkanah[^h511], and all his house[^h1004], went up[^h5927] to offer[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068] the yearly[^h3117] sacrifice[^h2077], and his vow[^h5088].
###### 22
But Hannah[^h2584] went not up[^h5927]; for she said[^h559] unto her husband[^h376], I will not go up until the child[^h5288] be weaned[^h1580], and then I will bring[^h935] him, that he may appear[^h7200] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and there abide[^h3427] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 23
And Elkanah[^h511] her husband[^h376] said[^h559] unto her, Do[^h6213] what seemeth[^h5869] thee good[^h2896]; tarry[^h3427] until thou have weaned[^h1580] him; only the LORD[^h3068] establish[^h6965] his word[^h1697]. So the woman[^h802] abode[^h3427], and gave her son[^h1121] suck[^h3243] until she weaned[^h1580] him.
###### 24
And when she had weaned[^h1580] him, she took him up[^h5927] with her, with three[^h7969] bullocks[^h6499], and one[^h259] ephah[^h374] of flour[^h7058], and a bottle[^h5035] of wine[^h3196], and brought[^h935] him unto the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068] in Shiloh[^h7887]: and the child[^h5288] was young[^h5288].
###### 25
And they slew[^h7819] a bullock[^h6499], and brought[^h935] the child[^h5288] to Eli[^h5941].
###### 26
And she said[^h559], Oh[^h994] my lord[^h113], as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], my lord[^h113], I am the woman[^h802] that stood[^h5324] by thee here, praying[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 27
For this child[^h5288] I prayed[^h6419]; and the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] me my petition[^h7596] which I asked[^h7592] of him:
###### 28
Therefore also I have lent[^h7592] him to the LORD[^h3068]; as long as he liveth[^h3117] he shall be lent[^h7592] to the LORD[^h3068]. And he worshipped[^h7812] the LORD[^h3068] there.

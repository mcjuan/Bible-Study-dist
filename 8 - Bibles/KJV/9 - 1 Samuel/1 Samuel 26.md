###### 1
And the Ziphites[^h2130] came[^h935] unto Saul[^h7586] to Gibeah[^h1390], saying[^h559], Doth not David[^h1732] hide[^h5641] himself in the hill[^h1389] of Hachilah[^h2444], which is before[^h6440] Jeshimon[^h3452]?
###### 2
Then Saul[^h7586] arose[^h6965], and went down[^h3381] to the wilderness[^h4057] of Ziph[^h2128], having three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] with him, to seek[^h1245] David[^h1732] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Ziph[^h2128].
###### 3
And Saul[^h7586] pitched[^h2583] in the hill[^h1389] of Hachilah[^h2444], which is before[^h6440] Jeshimon[^h3452], by the way[^h1870]. But David[^h1732] abode[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057], and he saw[^h7200] that Saul[^h7586] came[^h935] after[^h310] him into the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 4
David[^h1732] therefore sent out[^h7971] spies[^h7270], and understood[^h3045] that Saul[^h7586] was come[^h935] in very deed[^h3559].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and came[^h935] to the place[^h4725] where Saul[^h7586] had pitched[^h2583]: and David[^h1732] beheld[^h7200] the place[^h4725] where Saul[^h7586] lay[^h7901], and Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], the captain[^h8269] of his host[^h6635]: and Saul[^h7586] lay[^h7901] in the trench[^h4570], and the people[^h5971] pitched[^h2583] round about[^h5439] him. 
###### 6
Then answered[^h6030] David[^h1732] and said[^h559] to Ahimelech[^h288] the Hittite[^h2850], and to Abishai[^h52] the son[^h1121] of Zeruiah[^h6870], brother[^h251] to Joab[^h3097], saying[^h559], Who will go down[^h3381] with me to Saul[^h7586] to the camp[^h4264]? And Abishai[^h52] said[^h559], I will go down[^h3381] with thee.
###### 7
So David[^h1732] and Abishai[^h52] came[^h935] to the people[^h5971] by night[^h3915]: and, behold, Saul[^h7586] lay[^h7901] sleeping[^h3463] within the trench[^h4570], and his spear[^h2595] stuck[^h4600] in the ground[^h776] at his bolster[^h4763]: but Abner[^h74] and the people[^h5971] lay[^h7901] round about[^h5439] him.
###### 8
Then said[^h559] Abishai[^h52] to David[^h1732], God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5462] thine enemy[^h341] into thine hand[^h3027] this day[^h3117]: now therefore let me smite[^h5221] him, I pray thee, with the spear[^h2595] even to the earth[^h776] at once[^h6471] [^h259], and I will not smite him the second time[^h8138]. 
###### 9
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abishai[^h52], Destroy[^h7843] him not: for who can stretch forth[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] against the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899], and be guiltless[^h5352]?
###### 10
David[^h1732] said[^h559] furthermore, As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], the LORD[^h3068] shall smite[^h5062] him; or his day[^h3117] shall come[^h935] to die[^h4191]; or he shall descend[^h3381] into battle[^h4421], and perish[^h5595].
###### 11
The LORD[^h3068] forbid[^h2486] that I should stretch forth[^h7971] mine hand[^h3027] against the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899]: but, I pray thee, take[^h3947] thou now the spear[^h2595] that is at his bolster[^h4763], and the cruse[^h6835] of water[^h4325], and let us go[^h3212].
###### 12
So David[^h1732] took[^h3947] the spear[^h2595] and the cruse[^h6835] of water[^h4325] from Saul's[^h7586] bolster[^h7226]; and they gat them away[^h3212], and no man saw[^h7200] it, nor knew[^h3045] it, neither awaked[^h6974]: for they were all asleep[^h3463]; because a deep sleep[^h8639] from the LORD[^h3068] was fallen[^h5307] upon them.
###### 13
Then David[^h1732] went over[^h5674] to the other side[^h5676], and stood[^h5975] on the top[^h7218] of an hill[^h2022] afar off[^h7350]; a great[^h7227] space[^h4725] being between them:
###### 14
And David[^h1732] cried[^h7121] to the people[^h5971], and to Abner[^h74] the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], saying[^h559], Answerest[^h6030] thou not, Abner[^h74]? Then Abner[^h74] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Who art thou that criest[^h7121] to the king[^h4428]?
###### 15
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abner[^h74], Art not thou a valiant man[^h376]? and who is like to thee in Israel[^h3478]? wherefore then hast thou not kept[^h8104] thy lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]? for there came[^h935] one[^h259] of the people[^h5971] in to destroy[^h7843] the king[^h4428] thy lord[^h113].
###### 16
This thing[^h1697] is not good[^h2896] that thou hast done[^h6213]. As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], ye are worthy[^h1121] to die[^h4194], because ye have not kept[^h8104] your master[^h113], the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899]. And now see[^h7200] where the king's[^h4428] spear[^h2595] is, and the cruse[^h6835] of water[^h4325] that was at his bolster[^h4763]. 
###### 17
And Saul[^h7586] knew[^h5234] David's[^h1732] voice[^h6963], and said[^h559], Is this thy voice[^h6963], my son[^h1121] David[^h1732]? And David[^h1732] said[^h559], It is my voice[^h6963], my lord[^h113], O king[^h4428].
###### 18
And he said[^h559], Wherefore doth my lord[^h113] thus pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] his servant[^h5650]? for what have I done[^h6213]? or what evil[^h7451] is in mine hand[^h3027]?
###### 19
Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428] hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of his servant[^h5650]. If the LORD[^h3068] have stirred thee up[^h5496] against me, let him accept[^h7306] an offering[^h4503]: but if they be the children[^h1121] of men[^h120], cursed[^h779] be they before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; for they have driven[^h1644] me out this day[^h3117] from abiding[^h5596] in the inheritance[^h5159] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Go[^h3212], serve[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430].  
###### 20
Now therefore, let not my blood[^h1818] fall[^h5307] to the earth[^h776] before the face[^h6440] of the LORD[^h3068]: for the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] is come out[^h3318] to seek[^h1245] a[^h259] flea[^h6550], as when one doth hunt[^h7291] a partridge[^h7124] in the mountains[^h2022].
###### 21
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586], I have sinned[^h2398]: return[^h7725], my son[^h1121] David[^h1732]: for I will no more do thee harm[^h7489], because my soul[^h5315] was precious[^h3365] in thine eyes[^h5869] this day[^h3117]: behold, I have played the fool[^h5528], and have erred[^h7686] exceedingly[^h7235] [^h3966].
###### 22
And David[^h1732] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Behold the king's[^h4428] spear[^h2595]! and let one[^h259] of the young men[^h5288] come over[^h5674] and fetch[^h3947] it.
###### 23
The LORD[^h3068] render[^h7725] to every man[^h376] his righteousness[^h6666] and his faithfulness[^h530]: for the LORD[^h3068] delivered[^h5414] thee into my hand[^h3027] to day[^h3117], but I would[^h14] not stretch forth[^h7971] mine hand[^h3027] against the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899].
###### 24
And, behold, as thy life[^h5315] was much set by[^h1431] this day[^h3117] in mine eyes[^h5869], so let my life[^h5315] be much set by[^h1431] in the eyes[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], and let him deliver[^h5337] me out of all tribulation[^h6869].
###### 25
Then Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Blessed[^h1288] be thou, my son[^h1121] David[^h1732]: thou shalt both do[^h6213] great[^h6213] things, and also shalt still[^h3201] prevail[^h3201]. So David[^h1732] went[^h3212] on his way[^h1870], and Saul[^h7586] returned[^h7725] to his place[^h4725].

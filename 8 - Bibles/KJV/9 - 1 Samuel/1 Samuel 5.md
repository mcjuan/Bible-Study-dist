###### 1
And the Philistines[^h6430] took[^h3947] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], and brought[^h935] it from Ebenezer[^h72] unto Ashdod[^h795].
###### 2
When the Philistines[^h6430] took[^h3947] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], they brought[^h935] it into the house[^h1004] of Dagon[^h1712], and set[^h3322] it by[^h681] Dagon[^h1712].
###### 3
And when they of Ashdod[^h796] arose early[^h7925] on the morrow[^h4283], behold, Dagon[^h1712] was fallen[^h5307] upon his face[^h6440] to the earth[^h776] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068]. And they took[^h3947] Dagon[^h1712], and set[^h7725] him in his place[^h4725] again[^h7725].
###### 4
And when they arose early[^h7925] on the morrow[^h4283] morning[^h1242], behold, Dagon[^h1712] was fallen[^h5307] upon his face[^h6440] to the ground[^h776] before[^h6440] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068]; and the head[^h7218] of Dagon[^h1712] and both[^h8147] the palms[^h3709] of his hands[^h3027] were cut off[^h3772] upon the threshold[^h4670]; only the stump of Dagon[^h1712] was left[^h7604] to him. 
###### 5
Therefore neither the priests[^h3548] of Dagon[^h1712], nor any that come[^h935] into Dagon's[^h1712] house[^h1004], tread[^h1869] on the threshold[^h4670] of Dagon[^h1712] in Ashdod[^h795] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 6
But the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was heavy[^h3513] upon them of Ashdod[^h796], and he destroyed[^h8074] them, and smote[^h5221] them with emerods[^h2914] [^h6076], even Ashdod[^h795] and the coasts[^h1366] thereof.
###### 7
And when the men[^h582] of Ashdod[^h795] saw[^h7200] that it was so, they said[^h559], The ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] shall not abide[^h3427] with us: for his hand[^h3027] is sore[^h7185] upon us, and upon Dagon[^h1712] our god[^h430].
###### 8
They sent[^h7971] therefore and gathered[^h622] all the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] unto them, and said[^h559], What shall we do[^h6213] with the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]? And they answered[^h559], Let the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] be carried about[^h5437] unto Gath[^h1661]. And they carried[^h5437] the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] about[^h5437] thither.
###### 9
And it was so, that, after[^h310] they had carried it about[^h5437], the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was against the city[^h5892] with a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] destruction[^h4103]: and he smote[^h5221] the men[^h582] of the city[^h5892], both small[^h6996] and great[^h1419], and they had emerods[^h2914] [^h6076] in their secret parts[^h8368].
###### 10
Therefore they sent[^h7971] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] to Ekron[^h6138]. And it came to pass, as the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] came[^h935] to Ekron[^h6138], that the Ekronites[^h6139] cried out[^h2199], saying[^h559], They have brought about[^h5437] the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] to us, to slay[^h4191] us and our people[^h5971]. 
###### 11
So they sent[^h7971] and gathered together[^h622] all the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430], and said[^h559], Send away[^h7971] the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], and let it go again[^h7725] to his own place[^h4725], that it slay[^h4191] us not, and our people[^h5971]: for there was a deadly[^h4194] destruction[^h4103] throughout all the city[^h5892]; the hand[^h3027] of God[^h430] was very[^h3966] heavy[^h3513] there. 
###### 12
And the men[^h582] that died[^h4191] not were smitten[^h5221] with the emerods[^h2914] [^h6076]: and the cry[^h7775] of the city[^h5892] went up[^h5927] to heaven[^h8064].

###### 1
Now there was a man[^h376] of Benjamin[^h1144], whose name[^h8034] was Kish[^h7027], the son[^h1121] of Abiel[^h22], the son[^h1121] of Zeror[^h6872], the son[^h1121] of Bechorath[^h1064], the son[^h1121] of Aphiah[^h647], a Benjamite[^h1145], a mighty[^h1368] man[^h376] of power[^h2428].  
###### 2
And he had a son[^h1121], whose name[^h8034] was Saul[^h7586], a choice young man[^h970], and a goodly[^h2896]: and there was not among the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] a goodlier[^h2896] person[^h376] than he: from his shoulders[^h7926] and upward[^h4605] he was higher[^h1364] than any of the people[^h5971].
###### 3
And the asses[^h860] of Kish[^h7027] Saul's[^h7586] father[^h1] were lost[^h6]. And Kish[^h7027] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586] his son[^h1121], Take[^h3947] now one[^h259] of the servants[^h5288] with thee, and arise[^h6965], go[^h3212] seek[^h1245] the asses[^h860].
###### 4
And he passed through[^h5674] mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], and passed through[^h5674] the land[^h776] of Shalisha[^h8031], but they found[^h4672] them not: then they passed through[^h5674] the land[^h776] of Shalim[^h8171], and there they were not: and he passed through[^h5674] the land[^h776] of the Benjamites[^h1145], but they found[^h4672] them not.
###### 5
And when they were come[^h935] to the land[^h776] of Zuph[^h6689], Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to his servant[^h5288] that was with him, Come[^h3212], and let us return[^h7725]; lest my father[^h1] leave[^h2308] caring for the asses[^h860], and take thought[^h1672] for us.
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto him, Behold now, there is in this city[^h5892] a man[^h376] of God[^h430], and he is an honourable[^h3513] man[^h376]; all that he saith[^h1696] cometh[^h935] surely to pass[^h935]: now let us go[^h3212] thither; peradventure he can shew[^h5046] us our way[^h1870] that we should go[^h1980].
###### 7
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586] to his servant[^h5288], But, behold, if we go[^h3212], what shall we bring[^h935] the man[^h376]? for the bread[^h3899] is spent[^h235] in our vessels[^h3627], and there is not a present[^h8670] to bring[^h935] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430]: what have we?  
###### 8
And the servant[^h5288] answered[^h6030] Saul[^h7586] again[^h3254], and said[^h559], Behold, I have[^h4672] here at hand[^h3027] the fourth part[^h7253] of a shekel[^h8255] of silver[^h3701]: that will I give[^h5414] to the man[^h376] of God[^h430], to tell[^h5046] us our way[^h1870]. 
###### 9
(Beforetime[^h6440] in Israel[^h3478], when a man[^h376] went[^h3212] to enquire[^h1875] of God[^h430], thus he spake[^h559], Come[^h3212], and let us go[^h3212] to the seer[^h7200]: for he that is now[^h3117] called a Prophet[^h5030] was beforetime[^h6440] called[^h7121] a Seer[^h7200].)
###### 10
Then said[^h1697] Saul[^h7586] to his servant[^h5288], Well[^h2896] said[^h559]; come[^h3212], let us go[^h3212]. So they went[^h3212] unto the city[^h5892] where the man[^h376] of God[^h430] was. 
###### 11
And as they went up[^h5927] the hill[^h4608] to the city[^h5892], they found[^h4672] young maidens[^h5291] going out[^h3318] to draw[^h7579] water[^h4325], and said[^h559] unto them, Is[^h3426] the seer[^h7200] here? 
###### 12
And they answered[^h6030] them, and said[^h559], He is[^h3426]; behold, he is before[^h6440] you: make haste[^h4116] now, for he came[^h935] to day[^h3117] to the city[^h5892]; for there is a sacrifice[^h2077] of the people[^h5971] to day[^h3117] in the high place[^h1116]: 
###### 13
As soon as ye be come[^h935] into the city[^h5892], ye shall straightway[^h3651] find[^h4672] him, before he go up[^h5927] to the high place[^h1116] to eat[^h398]: for the people[^h5971] will not eat[^h398] until he come[^h935], because he doth bless[^h1288] the sacrifice[^h2077]; and afterwards[^h310] [^h3651] they eat[^h398] that be bidden[^h7121]. Now therefore get you up[^h5927]; for about this time[^h3117] ye shall find[^h4672] him. 
###### 14
And they went up[^h5927] into[^h8432] the city[^h5892]: and when they were come[^h935] into the city[^h5892], behold, Samuel[^h8050] came out[^h3318] against[^h7125] them, for to go up[^h5927] to the high place[^h1116].
###### 15
Now the LORD[^h3068] had told[^h1540] Samuel[^h8050] in his ear[^h241] a[^h259] day[^h3117] before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586] came[^h935], saying[^h559], 
###### 16
To morrow[^h4279] about this time[^h6256] I will send[^h7971] thee a man[^h376] out of the land[^h776] of Benjamin[^h1144], and thou shalt anoint[^h4886] him to be captain[^h5057] over my people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478], that he may save[^h3467] my people[^h5971] out of the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430]: for I have looked[^h7200] upon my people[^h5971], because their cry[^h6818] is come[^h935] unto me.
###### 17
And when Samuel[^h8050] saw[^h7200] Saul[^h7586], the LORD[^h3068] said[^h6030] unto him, Behold the man[^h376] whom I spake[^h559] to thee of! this same shall reign[^h6113] over my people[^h5971]. 
###### 18
Then Saul[^h7586] drew near[^h5066] to Samuel[^h8050] in[^h8432] the gate[^h8179], and said[^h559], Tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, where[^h335] the seer's[^h7200] house[^h1004] is.
###### 19
And Samuel[^h8050] answered[^h6030] Saul[^h7586], and said[^h559], I am the seer[^h7200]: go up[^h5927] before[^h6440] me unto the high place[^h1116]; for ye shall eat[^h398] with me to day[^h3117], and to morrow[^h1242] I will let thee go[^h7971], and will tell[^h5046] thee all that is in thine heart[^h3824].
###### 20
And as for thine asses[^h860] that were lost[^h6] three[^h7969] days[^h3117] ago[^h3117], set[^h7760] not thy mind[^h3820] on them; for they are found[^h4672]. And on whom is all the desire[^h2532] of Israel[^h3478]? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004]? 
###### 21
And Saul[^h7586] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Am not I a Benjamite[^h1145], of the smallest[^h6996] of the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478]? and my family[^h4940] the least[^h6810] of all the families[^h4940] of the tribe[^h7626] of Benjamin[^h1144]? wherefore then speakest[^h1696] thou so[^h1697] to me? 
###### 22
And Samuel[^h8050] took[^h3947] Saul[^h7586] and his servant[^h5288], and brought[^h935] them into the parlour[^h3957], and made them sit[^h5414] in the chiefest[^h7218] place[^h4725] among them that were bidden[^h7121], which were about thirty[^h7970] persons[^h376].
###### 23
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto the cook[^h2876], Bring[^h5414] the portion[^h4490] which I gave[^h5414] thee, of which I said[^h559] unto thee, Set[^h7760] it by thee.
###### 24
And the cook[^h2876] took up[^h7311] the shoulder[^h7785], and that which was upon it, and set[^h7760] it before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586]. And Samuel said[^h559], Behold that which is left[^h7604]! set[^h7760] it before[^h6440] thee, and eat[^h398]: for unto this time[^h4150] hath it been kept[^h8104] for thee since I said[^h559], I have invited[^h7121] the people[^h5971]. So Saul[^h7586] did eat[^h398] with Samuel[^h8050] that day[^h3117]. 
###### 25
And when they were come down[^h3381] from the high place[^h1116] into the city[^h5892], Samuel communed[^h1696] with Saul[^h7586] upon the top of the house[^h1406].
###### 26
And they arose early[^h7925]: and it came to pass about the spring[^h5927] of the day[^h7837], that Samuel[^h8050] called[^h7121] Saul[^h7586] to the top of the house[^h1406], saying[^h559], Up[^h6965], that I may send thee away[^h7971]. And Saul[^h7586] arose[^h6965], and they went out[^h3318] both[^h8147] of them, he and Samuel[^h8050], abroad[^h2351].
###### 27
And as they were going down[^h3381] to the end[^h7097] of the city[^h5892], Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], Bid[^h559] the servant[^h5288] pass on[^h5674] before[^h6440] us, (and he passed on[^h5674],) but stand[^h5975] thou still a while[^h3117], that I may shew[^h8085] thee the word[^h1697] of God[^h430].

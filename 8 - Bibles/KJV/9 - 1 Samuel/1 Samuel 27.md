###### 1
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] in his heart[^h3820], I shall now perish[^h5595] one[^h259] day[^h3117] by the hand[^h3027] of Saul[^h7586]: there is nothing better[^h2896] for me than that[^h3588] I should speedily[^h4422] escape[^h4422] into the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430]; and Saul[^h7586] shall despair[^h2976] of me, to seek[^h1245] me any more in any coast[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]: so shall I escape[^h4422] out of his hand[^h3027]. 
###### 2
And David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and he passed over[^h5674] with the six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that were with him unto Achish[^h397], the son[^h1121] of Maoch[^h4582], king[^h4428] of Gath[^h1661].
###### 3
And David[^h1732] dwelt[^h3427] with Achish[^h397] at Gath[^h1661], he and his men[^h582], every man[^h376] with his household[^h1004], even David[^h1732] with his two[^h8147] wives[^h802], Ahinoam[^h293] the Jezreelitess[^h3159], and Abigail[^h26] the Carmelitess[^h3762], Nabal's[^h5037] wife[^h802].
###### 4
And it was told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586] that David[^h1732] was fled[^h1272] to Gath[^h1661]: and he sought[^h1245] no more again[^h3254] [^h3254] for him.
###### 5
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Achish[^h397], If I have now found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869], let them give[^h5414] me a place[^h4725] in some[^h259] town[^h5892] in the country[^h7704], that I may dwell[^h3427] there: for why should thy servant[^h5650] dwell[^h3427] in the royal[^h4467] city[^h5892] with thee?
###### 6
Then Achish[^h397] gave[^h5414] him Ziklag[^h6860] that day[^h3117]: wherefore Ziklag[^h6860] pertaineth unto the kings[^h4428] of Judah[^h3063] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 7
And the time[^h4557] [^h3117] that David[^h1732] dwelt[^h3427] in the country[^h7704] of the Philistines[^h6430] was a full year[^h3117] and four[^h702] months[^h2320].  
###### 8
And David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] went up[^h5927], and invaded[^h6584] the Geshurites[^h1651], and the Gezrites[^h1511], and the Amalekites[^h6003]: for those[^h2007] nations were of old[^h5769] the inhabitants[^h3427] of the land[^h776], as thou goest[^h935] to Shur[^h7793], even unto the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 9
And David[^h1732] smote[^h5221] the land[^h776], and left neither man[^h376] nor woman[^h802] alive[^h2421], and took away[^h3947] the sheep[^h6629], and the oxen[^h1241], and the asses[^h2543], and the camels[^h1581], and the apparel[^h899], and returned[^h7725], and came[^h935] to Achish[^h397].
###### 10
And Achish[^h397] said[^h559], Whither[^h408] have ye made a road[^h6584] to day[^h3117]? And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Against the south[^h5045] of Judah[^h3063], and against the south[^h5045] of the Jerahmeelites[^h3397], and against the south[^h5045] of the Kenites[^h7017]. 
###### 11
And David[^h1732] saved[^h2421] neither man[^h376] nor woman[^h802] alive[^h2421], to bring[^h935] tidings to Gath[^h1661], saying[^h559], Lest they should tell[^h5046] on us, saying[^h559], So did[^h6213] David[^h1732], and so will be his manner[^h4941] all the while[^h3117] he dwelleth[^h3427] in the country[^h7704] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 12
And Achish[^h397] believed[^h539] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], He hath made his people[^h5971] Israel[^h3478] utterly[^h887] to abhor[^h887] him; therefore he shall be my servant[^h5650] for ever[^h5769].

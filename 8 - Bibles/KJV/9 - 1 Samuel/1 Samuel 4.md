###### 1
And the word[^h1697] of Samuel[^h8050] came to all Israel[^h3478]. Now Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318] against[^h7125] the Philistines[^h6430] to battle[^h4421], and pitched[^h2583] beside Ebenezer[^h72]: and the Philistines[^h6430] pitched[^h2583] in Aphek[^h663]. 
###### 2
And the Philistines[^h6430] put themselves in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] Israel[^h3478]: and when they joined[^h5203] battle[^h4421], Israel[^h3478] was smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430]: and they slew[^h5221] of the army[^h4634] in the field[^h7704] about four[^h702] thousand[^h505] men[^h376].  
###### 3
And when the people[^h5971] were come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264], the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Wherefore hath the LORD[^h3068] smitten[^h5062] us to day[^h3117] before[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430]? Let us fetch[^h3947] the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] out of Shiloh[^h7887] unto us, that, when it cometh[^h935] among[^h7130] us, it may save[^h3467] us out of the hand[^h3709] of our enemies[^h341]. 
###### 4
So the people[^h5971] sent[^h7971] to Shiloh[^h7887], that they might bring[^h5375] from thence the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], which dwelleth[^h3427] between the cherubims[^h3742]: and the two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] of Eli[^h5941], Hophni[^h2652] and Phinehas[^h6372], were there with the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of God[^h430].
###### 5
And when the ark[^h727] of the covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h935] into the camp[^h4264], all Israel[^h3478] shouted[^h7321] with a great[^h1419] shout[^h8643], so that the earth[^h776] rang again[^h1949].
###### 6
And when the Philistines[^h6430] heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of the shout[^h8643], they said[^h559], What meaneth the noise[^h6963] of this great[^h1419] shout[^h8643] in the camp[^h4264] of the Hebrews[^h5680]? And they understood[^h3045] that the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] was come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264].
###### 7
And the Philistines[^h6430] were afraid[^h3372], for they said[^h559], God[^h430] is come[^h935] into the camp[^h4264]. And they said[^h559], Woe[^h188] unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore[^h865] [^h8032]. 
###### 8
Woe[^h188] unto us! who shall deliver[^h5337] us out of the hand[^h3027] of these mighty[^h117] Gods[^h430]? these are the Gods[^h430] that smote[^h5221] the Egyptians[^h4714] with all the plagues[^h4347] in the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 9
Be strong[^h2388], and quit[^h1961] yourselves like men[^h582], O ye Philistines[^h6430], that ye be not servants[^h5647] unto the Hebrews[^h5680], as they have been[^h5647] to you: quit[^h1961] yourselves like men[^h582], and fight[^h3898]. 
###### 10
And the Philistines[^h6430] fought[^h3898], and Israel[^h3478] was smitten[^h5062], and they fled[^h5127] every man[^h376] into his tent[^h168]: and there was a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]; for there fell[^h5307] of Israel[^h3478] thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] footmen[^h7273].
###### 11
And the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] was taken[^h3947]; and the two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] of Eli[^h5941], Hophni[^h2652] and Phinehas[^h6372], were slain[^h4191]. 
###### 12
And there ran[^h7323] a man[^h376] of Benjamin[^h1144] out of the army[^h4634], and came[^h935] to Shiloh[^h7887] the same day[^h3117] with his clothes[^h4055] rent[^h7167], and with earth[^h127] upon his head[^h7218].
###### 13
And when he came[^h935], lo, Eli[^h5941] sat[^h3427] upon a seat[^h3678] by the wayside[^h1870] [^h3027] [^h3197] watching[^h6822]: for his heart[^h3820] trembled[^h2730] for the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]. And when the man[^h376] came[^h935] into the city[^h5892], and told[^h5046] it, all the city[^h5892] cried out[^h2199].
###### 14
And when Eli[^h5941] heard[^h8085] the noise[^h6963] of the crying[^h6818], he said[^h559], What meaneth the noise[^h6963] of this tumult[^h1995]? And the man[^h376] came[^h935] in hastily[^h4116], and told[^h5046] Eli[^h5941].
###### 15
Now Eli[^h5941] was ninety[^h8673] and eight[^h8083] years[^h8141] old[^h1121]; and his eyes[^h5869] were dim[^h6965], that he could[^h3201] not see[^h7200]. 
###### 16
And the man[^h376] said[^h559] unto Eli[^h5941], I am he that came[^h935] out of the army[^h4634], and I fled[^h5127] to day[^h3117] out of the army[^h4634]. And he said[^h559], What is there done[^h1697], my son[^h1121]? 
###### 17
And the messenger[^h1319] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], Israel[^h3478] is fled[^h5127] before[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430], and there hath been also a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4046] among the people[^h5971], and thy two[^h8147] sons[^h1121] also, Hophni[^h2652] and Phinehas[^h6372], are dead[^h4191], and the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] is taken[^h3947].
###### 18
And it came to pass, when he made mention[^h2142] of the ark[^h727] of God[^h430], that he fell[^h5307] from off the seat[^h3678] backward[^h322] by[^h1157] the side[^h3027] of the gate[^h8179], and his neck[^h4665] brake[^h7665], and he died[^h4191]: for he was an old[^h2204] man[^h376], and heavy[^h3513]. And he had judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] forty[^h705] years[^h8141].
###### 19
And his daughter in law[^h3618], Phinehas'[^h6372] wife[^h802], was with child[^h2030], near to be delivered[^h3205]: and when she heard[^h8085] the tidings[^h8052] that[^h413] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] was taken[^h3947], and that her father in law[^h2524] and her husband[^h376] were dead[^h4191], she bowed[^h3766] herself and travailed[^h3205]; for her pains[^h6735] came[^h2015] upon her.  
###### 20
And about the time[^h6256] of her death[^h4191] the women that stood[^h5324] by her said[^h1696] unto her, Fear[^h3372] not; for thou hast born[^h3205] a son[^h1121]. But she answered[^h6030] not, neither did she regard[^h7896] [^h3820] it. 
###### 21
And she named[^h7121] the child[^h5288] Ichabod[^h350], saying[^h559], The glory[^h3519] is departed[^h1540] from Israel[^h3478]: because[^h413] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] was taken[^h3947], and because of her father in law[^h2524] and her husband[^h376]. 
###### 22
And she said[^h559], The glory[^h3519] is departed[^h1540] from Israel[^h3478]: for the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] is taken[^h3947].

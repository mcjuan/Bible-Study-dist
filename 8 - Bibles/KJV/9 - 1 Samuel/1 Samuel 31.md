###### 1
Now the Philistines[^h6430] fought[^h3898] against Israel[^h3478]: and the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] fled[^h5127] from before[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430], and fell down[^h5307] slain[^h2491] in mount[^h2022] Gilboa[^h1533]. 
###### 2
And the Philistines[^h6430] followed hard[^h1692] upon Saul[^h7586] and upon his sons[^h1121]; and the Philistines[^h6430] slew[^h5221] Jonathan[^h3083], and Abinadab[^h41], and Malchishua[^h4444], Saul's[^h7586] sons[^h1121].
###### 3
And the battle[^h4421] went sore[^h3513] against Saul[^h7586], and the archers[^h3384] [^h582] [^h7198] hit[^h4672] him; and he was sore[^h3966] wounded[^h2342] of the archers[^h3384] [^h582] [^h7198].  
###### 4
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586] unto his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], Draw[^h8025] thy sword[^h2719], and thrust me through[^h1856] therewith; lest these uncircumcised[^h6189] come[^h935] and thrust me through[^h1856], and abuse[^h5953] me. But his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] would[^h14] not; for he was sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372]. Therefore Saul[^h7586] took[^h3947] a sword[^h2719], and fell[^h5307] upon it. 
###### 5
And when his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] saw[^h7200] that Saul[^h7586] was dead[^h4191], he fell[^h5307] likewise upon his sword[^h2719], and died[^h4191] with him.
###### 6
So Saul[^h7586] died[^h4191], and his three[^h7969] sons[^h1121], and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], and all his men[^h582], that same day[^h3117] together[^h3162].
###### 7
And when the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] that were on the other side[^h5676] of the valley[^h6010], and they that were on the other side[^h5676] Jordan[^h3383], saw[^h7200] that the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] fled[^h5127], and that Saul[^h7586] and his sons[^h1121] were dead[^h4191], they forsook[^h5800] the cities[^h5892], and fled[^h5127]; and the Philistines[^h6430] came[^h935] and dwelt[^h3427] in them.
###### 8
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], when the Philistines[^h6430] came[^h935] to strip[^h6584] the slain[^h2491], that they found[^h4672] Saul[^h7586] and his three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] fallen[^h5307] in mount[^h2022] Gilboa[^h1533].
###### 9
And they cut off[^h3772] his head[^h7218], and stripped off[^h6584] his armour[^h3627], and sent[^h7971] into the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430] round about[^h5439], to publish[^h1319] it in the house[^h1004] of their idols[^h6091], and among the people[^h5971].
###### 10
And they put[^h7760] his armour[^h3627] in the house[^h1004] of Ashtaroth[^h6252] [^h1045]: and they fastened[^h8628] his body[^h1472] to the wall[^h2346] of Bethshan[^h1052].
###### 11
And when the inhabitants[^h3427] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568] heard[^h8085] of that which the Philistines[^h6430] had done[^h6213] to Saul[^h7586]; 
###### 12
All the valiant[^h2428] men[^h376] [^h381] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] all night[^h3915], and took[^h3947] the body[^h1472] of Saul[^h7586] and the bodies[^h1472] of his sons[^h1121] from the wall[^h2346] of Bethshan[^h1052], and came[^h935] to Jabesh[^h3003], and burnt[^h8313] them there.
###### 13
And they took[^h3947] their bones[^h6106], and buried[^h6912] them under a tree[^h815] at Jabesh[^h3003], and fasted[^h6684] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117].

###### 1
And it came to pass, when Saul[^h7586] was returned[^h7725] from following[^h310] the Philistines[^h6430], that it was told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], Behold, David[^h1732] is in the wilderness[^h4057] of Engedi[^h5872]. 
###### 2
Then Saul[^h7586] took[^h3947] three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] chosen[^h977] men[^h376] out of all Israel[^h3478], and went[^h3212] to seek[^h1245] David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] upon[^h6440] the rocks[^h6697] of the wild goats[^h3277].
###### 3
And he came[^h935] to the sheepcotes[^h1448] [^h6629] by the way[^h1870], where was a cave[^h4631]; and Saul[^h7586] went in[^h935] to cover[^h5526] his feet[^h7272]: and David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] remained[^h3427] in the sides[^h3411] of the cave[^h4631].
###### 4
And the men[^h582] of David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, Behold the day[^h3117] of which the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto thee, Behold, I will deliver[^h5414] thine enemy[^h341] into thine hand[^h3027], that thou mayest do[^h6213] to him as it shall seem good[^h3190] unto thee[^h5869]. Then David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and cut off[^h3772] the skirt[^h3671] of Saul's[^h7586] robe[^h4598] privily[^h3909]. 
###### 5
And it came to pass afterward[^h310], that David's[^h1732] heart[^h3820] smote[^h5221] him, because he had cut off[^h3772] Saul's[^h7586] skirt[^h3671].
###### 6
And he said[^h559] unto his men[^h582], The LORD[^h3068] forbid[^h2486] that I should do[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] unto my master[^h113], the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899], to stretch forth[^h7971] mine hand[^h3027] against him, seeing he is the anointed[^h4899] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 7
So David[^h1732] stayed[^h8156] his servants[^h582] with these words[^h1697], and suffered[^h5414] them not to rise[^h6965] against Saul[^h7586]. But Saul[^h7586] rose up[^h6965] out of the cave[^h4631], and went[^h3212] on his way[^h1870]. 
###### 8
David[^h1732] also arose[^h6965] afterward, and went out[^h3318] of the cave[^h4631], and cried[^h7121] after[^h310] Saul[^h7586], saying[^h559], My lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]. And when Saul[^h7586] looked[^h5027] behind[^h310] him, David[^h1732] stooped[^h6915] with his face[^h639] to the earth[^h776], and bowed[^h7812] himself.
###### 9
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], Wherefore hearest[^h8085] thou men's[^h120] words[^h1697], saying[^h559], Behold, David[^h1732] seeketh[^h1245] thy hurt[^h7451]?
###### 10
Behold, this day[^h3117] thine eyes[^h5869] have seen[^h7200] how that the LORD[^h3068] had delivered[^h5414] thee to day[^h3117] into mine hand[^h3027] in the cave[^h4631]: and some bade[^h559] me kill[^h2026] thee: but mine eye spared[^h2347] thee; and I said[^h559], I will not put forth[^h7971] mine hand[^h3027] against my lord[^h113]; for he is the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899].
###### 11
Moreover, my father[^h1], see[^h7200], yea, see[^h7200] the skirt[^h3671] of thy robe[^h4598] in my hand[^h3027]: for in that I cut off[^h3772] the skirt[^h3671] of thy robe[^h4598], and killed[^h2026] thee not, know[^h3045] thou and see[^h7200] that there is neither evil[^h7451] nor transgression[^h6588] in mine hand[^h3027], and I have not sinned[^h2398] against thee; yet thou huntest[^h6658] my soul[^h5315] to take[^h3947] it.
###### 12
The LORD[^h3068] judge[^h8199] between me and thee, and the LORD[^h3068] avenge[^h5358] me of thee: but mine hand[^h3027] shall not be upon thee.
###### 13
As saith[^h559] the proverb[^h4912] of the ancients[^h6931], Wickedness[^h7562] proceedeth[^h3318] from the wicked[^h7563]: but mine hand[^h3027] shall not be upon thee.
###### 14
After[^h310] whom is the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478] come out[^h3318]? after[^h310] whom dost thou pursue[^h7291]? after[^h310] a dead[^h4191] dog[^h3611], after[^h310] a[^h259] flea[^h6550].
###### 15
The LORD[^h3068] therefore be judge[^h1781], and judge[^h8199] between me and thee, and see[^h7200], and plead[^h7378] my cause[^h7379], and deliver[^h8199] me out of thine hand[^h3027]. 
###### 16
And it came to pass, when David[^h1732] had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] these words[^h1697] unto Saul[^h7586], that Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Is this thy voice[^h6963], my son[^h1121] David[^h1732]? And Saul[^h7586] lifted up[^h5375] his voice[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 17
And he said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Thou art more righteous[^h6662] than I: for thou hast rewarded[^h1580] me good[^h2896], whereas I have rewarded[^h1580] thee evil[^h7451].
###### 18
And thou hast shewed[^h5046] this day[^h3117] how that thou hast dealt[^h6213] well[^h2896] with me: forasmuch as when the LORD[^h3068] had delivered[^h5462] me into thine hand[^h3027], thou killedst[^h2026] me not. 
###### 19
For if a man[^h376] find[^h4672] his enemy[^h341], will he let him go[^h7971] well[^h2896] away[^h1870]? wherefore the LORD[^h3068] reward[^h7999] thee good[^h2896] for that thou hast done[^h6213] unto me this day[^h3117].
###### 20
And now, behold, I know well[^h3045] that thou shalt surely[^h4427] be king[^h4427], and that the kingdom[^h4467] of Israel[^h3478] shall be established[^h6965] in thine hand[^h3027].
###### 21
Swear[^h7650] now therefore unto me by the LORD[^h3068], that thou wilt not[^h518] cut off[^h3772] my seed[^h2233] after[^h310] me, and that thou wilt not destroy[^h8045] my name[^h8034] out of my father's[^h1] house[^h1004].
###### 22
And David[^h1732] sware[^h7650] unto Saul[^h7586]. And Saul[^h7586] went[^h3212] home[^h1004]; but David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] gat them up[^h5927] unto the hold[^h4686].

###### 1
And Samuel[^h8050] died[^h4191]; and all the Israelites[^h3478] were gathered together[^h6908], and lamented[^h5594] him, and buried[^h6912] him in his house[^h1004] at Ramah[^h7414]. And David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and went down[^h3381] to the wilderness[^h4057] of Paran[^h6290].
###### 2
And there was a man[^h376] in Maon[^h4584], whose possessions[^h4639] were in Carmel[^h3760]; and the man[^h376] was very[^h3966] great[^h1419], and he had three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] sheep[^h6629], and a thousand[^h505] goats[^h5795]: and he was shearing[^h1494] his sheep[^h6629] in Carmel[^h3760]. 
###### 3
Now the name[^h8034] of the man[^h376] was Nabal[^h5037]; and the name[^h8034] of his wife[^h802] Abigail[^h26]: and she was a woman[^h802] of good[^h2896] understanding[^h7922], and of a beautiful[^h3303] countenance[^h8389]: but the man[^h376] was churlish[^h7186] and evil[^h7451] in his doings[^h4611]; and he was of the house of Caleb[^h3614].
###### 4
And David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] in the wilderness[^h4057] that Nabal[^h5037] did shear[^h1494] his sheep[^h6629].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] sent out[^h7971] ten[^h6235] young men[^h5288], and David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto the young men[^h5288], Get you up[^h5927] to Carmel[^h3760], and go[^h935] to Nabal[^h5037], and greet[^h7592] [^h7965] him in my name[^h8034]: 
###### 6
And thus shall ye say[^h559] to him that liveth[^h2416] in prosperity, Peace[^h7965] be both to thee, and peace[^h7965] be to thine house[^h1004], and peace[^h7965] be unto all that thou hast.
###### 7
And now I have heard[^h8085] that thou hast shearers[^h1494]: now thy shepherds[^h7462] which were with us, we hurt[^h3637] them not, neither was there ought[^h3972] missing[^h6485] unto them, all the while[^h3117] they were in Carmel[^h3760]. 
###### 8
Ask[^h7592] thy young men[^h5288], and they will shew[^h5046] thee. Wherefore let the young men[^h5288] find[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869]: for we come[^h935] in a good[^h2896] day[^h3117]: give[^h5414], I pray thee, whatsoever cometh[^h4672] to thine hand[^h3027] unto thy servants[^h5650], and to thy son[^h1121] David[^h1732].
###### 9
And when David's[^h1732] young men[^h5288] came[^h935], they spake[^h1696] to Nabal[^h5037] according to all those words[^h1697] in the name[^h8034] of David[^h1732], and ceased[^h5117]. 
###### 10
And Nabal[^h5037] answered[^h6030] David's[^h1732] servants[^h5650], and said[^h559], Who is David[^h1732]? and who is the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448]? there be many[^h7231] servants[^h5650] now a days[^h3117] that break away[^h6555] every man[^h376] from[^h6440] his master[^h113].
###### 11
Shall I then take[^h3947] my bread[^h3899], and my water[^h4325], and my flesh[^h2878] that I have killed[^h2873] for my shearers[^h1494], and give[^h5414] it unto men[^h582], whom I know[^h3045] not whence they be? 
###### 12
So David's[^h1732] young men[^h5288] turned[^h2015] their way[^h1870], and went again[^h7725], and came[^h935] and told[^h5046] him all those sayings[^h1697].
###### 13
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto his men[^h582], Gird ye on[^h2296] every man[^h376] his sword[^h2719]. And they girded on[^h2296] every man[^h376] his sword[^h2719]; and David[^h1732] also girded on[^h2296] his sword[^h2719]: and there went up[^h5927] after[^h310] David[^h1732] about four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]; and two hundred[^h3967] abode[^h3427] by the stuff[^h3627].
###### 14
But one[^h259] of the young men[^h5288] told[^h5046] Abigail[^h26], Nabal's[^h5037] wife[^h802], saying[^h559], Behold, David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] out of the wilderness[^h4057] to salute[^h1288] our master[^h113]; and he railed[^h5860] on them. 
###### 15
But the men[^h582] were very[^h3966] good[^h2896] unto us, and we were not hurt[^h3637], neither missed[^h6485] we any thing[^h3972], as long as[^h3117] we were conversant[^h1980] with them, when we were in the fields[^h7704]: 
###### 16
They were a wall[^h2346] unto us both by night[^h3915] and day[^h3119], all the while[^h3117] we were with them keeping[^h7462] the sheep[^h6629].
###### 17
Now therefore know[^h3045] and consider[^h7200] what thou wilt do[^h6213]; for evil[^h7451] is determined[^h3615] against our master[^h113], and against all his household[^h1004]: for he is such a son[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100], that a man cannot speak[^h1696] to him.
###### 18
Then Abigail[^h26] made haste[^h4116], and took[^h3947] two hundred[^h3967] loaves[^h3899], and two[^h8147] bottles[^h5035] of wine[^h3196], and five[^h2568] sheep[^h6629] ready dressed[^h6213], and five[^h2568] measures[^h5429] of parched[^h7039] corn, and an hundred[^h3967] clusters of raisins[^h6778], and two hundred[^h3967] cakes[^h1690] of figs, and laid[^h7760] them on asses[^h2543]. 
###### 19
And she said[^h559] unto her servants[^h5288], Go on[^h5674] before[^h6440] me; behold, I come[^h935] after[^h310] you. But she told[^h5046] not her husband[^h376] Nabal[^h5037].
###### 20
And it was so, as she rode[^h7392] on the ass[^h2543], that she came down[^h3381] by the covert[^h5643] of the hill[^h2022], and, behold, David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] came down[^h3381] against[^h7125] her; and she met[^h6298] them.
###### 21
Now David[^h1732] had said[^h559], Surely in vain[^h8267] have I kept[^h8104] all that this[^h2088] fellow hath in the wilderness[^h4057], so that nothing[^h3972] was missed[^h6485] of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited[^h7725] me evil[^h7451] for good[^h2896].
###### 22
So[^h3541] and more[^h3254] also do[^h6213] God[^h430] unto the enemies[^h341] of David[^h1732], if I leave[^h7604] of all that pertain to him by[^h5704] the morning[^h1242] light[^h216] any that pisseth[^h8366] against the wall[^h7023].
###### 23
And when Abigail[^h26] saw[^h7200] David[^h1732], she hasted[^h4116], and lighted off[^h3381] the ass[^h2543], and fell[^h5307] before[^h639] David[^h1732] on her face[^h6440], and bowed[^h7812] herself to the ground[^h776],
###### 24
And fell[^h5307] at his feet[^h7272], and said[^h559], Upon me, my lord[^h113], upon me let this iniquity[^h5771] be: and let thine handmaid[^h519], I pray thee, speak[^h1696] in thine audience[^h241], and hear[^h8085] the words[^h1697] of thine handmaid[^h589]. 
###### 25
Let[^h7760] not my lord[^h113], I pray thee, regard[^h3820] this man[^h376] of Belial[^h1100], even Nabal[^h5037]: for as his name[^h8034] is, so is he; Nabal[^h5037] is his name[^h8034], and folly[^h5039] is with him: but I thine handmaid[^h519] saw[^h7200] not the young men[^h5288] of my lord[^h113], whom thou didst send[^h7971].  
###### 26
Now therefore, my lord[^h113], as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], seeing the LORD[^h3068] hath withholden[^h4513] thee from coming[^h935] to shed blood[^h1818], and from avenging[^h3467] thyself with thine own hand[^h3027], now let thine enemies[^h341], and they that seek[^h1245] evil[^h7451] to my lord[^h113], be as Nabal[^h5037]. 
###### 27
And now this blessing[^h1293] which thine handmaid[^h8198] hath brought[^h935] unto my lord[^h113], let it even be given[^h5414] unto the young men[^h5288] that follow[^h1980] [^h7272] my lord[^h113].  
###### 28
I pray thee, forgive[^h5375] the trespass[^h6588] of thine handmaid[^h519]: for the LORD[^h3068] will certainly[^h6213] make[^h6213] my lord[^h113] a sure[^h539] house[^h1004]; because my lord[^h113] fighteth[^h3898] the battles[^h4421] of the LORD[^h3068], and evil[^h7451] hath not been found[^h4672] in thee all thy days[^h3117].
###### 29
Yet a man[^h120] is risen[^h6965] to pursue[^h7291] thee, and to seek[^h1245] thy soul[^h5315]: but the soul[^h5315] of my lord[^h113] shall be bound[^h6887] in the bundle[^h6872] of life[^h2416] with the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430]; and the souls[^h5315] of thine enemies[^h341], them shall he sling out[^h7049], as out of the middle[^h8432] [^h3709] of a sling[^h7050]. 
###### 30
And it shall come to pass, when the LORD[^h3068] shall have done[^h6213] to my lord[^h113] according to all the good[^h2896] that he hath spoken[^h1696] concerning thee, and shall have appointed[^h6680] thee ruler[^h5057] over Israel[^h3478];
###### 31
That this shall be no grief[^h6330] unto thee, nor offence[^h4383] of heart[^h3820] unto my lord[^h113], either that thou hast shed[^h8210] blood[^h1818] causeless[^h2600], or that my lord[^h113] hath avenged[^h3467] himself: but when the LORD[^h3068] shall have dealt well[^h3190] with my lord[^h113], then remember[^h2142] thine handmaid[^h519]. 
###### 32
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abigail[^h26], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], which sent[^h7971] thee this day[^h3117] to meet[^h7125] me:
###### 33
And blessed[^h1288] be thy advice[^h2940], and blessed[^h1288] be thou, which hast kept[^h3607] me this day[^h3117] from coming[^h935] to shed blood[^h1818], and from avenging[^h3467] myself with mine own hand[^h3027].
###### 34
For in very deed[^h199], as the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] liveth[^h2416], which hath kept me back[^h4513] from hurting[^h7489] thee, except[^h3884] thou hadst hasted[^h4116] and come[^h935] to meet[^h7125] me, surely there had not been left[^h3498] unto Nabal[^h5037] by the morning[^h1242] light[^h216] any that pisseth[^h8366] against the wall[^h7023].
###### 35
So David[^h1732] received[^h3947] of her hand[^h3027] that which she had brought[^h935] him, and said[^h559] unto her, Go up[^h5927] in peace[^h7965] to thine house[^h1004]; see[^h7200], I have hearkened[^h8085] to thy voice[^h6963], and have accepted[^h5375] thy person[^h6440].
###### 36
And Abigail[^h26] came[^h935] to Nabal[^h5037]; and, behold, he held a feast[^h4960] in his house[^h1004], like the feast[^h4960] of a king[^h4428]; and Nabal's[^h5037] heart[^h3820] was merry[^h2896] within him, for he was very[^h3966] drunken[^h7910]: wherefore she told[^h5046] him nothing[^h1697], less[^h6996] or more[^h1419], until the morning[^h1242] light[^h216].
###### 37
But it came to pass in the morning[^h1242], when the wine[^h3196] was gone out[^h3318] of Nabal[^h5037], and his wife[^h802] had told[^h5046] him these things[^h1697], that his heart[^h3820] died[^h4191] within[^h7130] him, and he became as a stone[^h68].
###### 38
And it came to pass about ten[^h6235] days[^h3117] after, that the LORD[^h3068] smote[^h5062] Nabal[^h5037], that he died[^h4191].
###### 39
And when David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] that Nabal[^h5037] was dead[^h4191], he said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be the LORD[^h3068], that hath pleaded[^h7378] the cause[^h7379] of my reproach[^h2781] from the hand[^h3027] of Nabal[^h5037], and hath kept[^h2820] his servant[^h5650] from evil[^h7451]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath returned[^h7725] the wickedness[^h7451] of Nabal[^h5037] upon his own head[^h7218]. And David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] and communed[^h1696] with Abigail[^h26], to take[^h3947] her to him to wife[^h802].
###### 40
And when the servants[^h5650] of David[^h1732] were come[^h935] to Abigail[^h26] to Carmel[^h3760], they spake[^h1696] unto her, saying[^h559], David[^h1732] sent[^h7971] us unto thee, to take[^h3947] thee to him to wife[^h802].
###### 41
And she arose[^h6965], and bowed[^h7812] herself on her face[^h639] to the earth[^h776], and said[^h559], Behold, let thine handmaid[^h519] be a servant[^h8198] to wash[^h7364] the feet[^h7272] of the servants[^h5650] of my lord[^h113].
###### 42
And Abigail[^h26] hasted[^h4116], and arose[^h6965], and rode[^h7392] upon an ass[^h2543], with five[^h2568] damsels[^h5291] of hers that went[^h1980] after[^h7272] her; and she went[^h3212] after[^h310] the messengers[^h4397] of David[^h1732], and became his wife[^h802]. 
###### 43
David[^h1732] also took[^h3947] Ahinoam[^h293] of Jezreel[^h3157]; and they were also both[^h8147] of them his wives[^h802].
###### 44
But Saul[^h7586] had given[^h5414] Michal[^h4324] his daughter[^h1323], David's[^h1732] wife[^h802], to Phalti[^h6406] the son[^h1121] of Laish[^h3919], which was of Gallim[^h1554].

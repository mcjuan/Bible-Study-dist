###### 1
And it came to pass, when he had made an end[^h3615] of speaking[^h1696] unto Saul[^h7586], that the soul[^h5315] of Jonathan[^h3083] was knit[^h7194] with the soul[^h5315] of David[^h1732], and Jonathan[^h3083] loved[^h157] him as his own soul[^h5315].
###### 2
And Saul[^h7586] took[^h3947] him that day[^h3117], and would let[^h5414] him go no more home[^h7725] to his father's[^h1] house[^h1004].
###### 3
Then Jonathan[^h3083] and David[^h1732] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285], because he loved[^h160] him as his own soul[^h5315].
###### 4
And Jonathan[^h3083] stripped[^h6584] himself of the robe[^h4598] that was upon him, and gave[^h5414] it to David[^h1732], and his garments[^h4055], even to his sword[^h2719], and to his bow[^h7198], and to his girdle[^h2289].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] went out[^h3318] whithersoever Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] him, and behaved himself wisely[^h7919]: and Saul[^h7586] set[^h7760] him over the men[^h582] of war[^h4421], and he was accepted[^h3190] in the sight[^h5869] of all the people[^h5971], and also in the sight[^h5869] of Saul's[^h7586] servants[^h5650]. 
###### 6
And it came to pass as they came[^h935], when David[^h1732] was returned[^h7725] from the slaughter[^h5221] of the Philistine[^h6430], that the women[^h802] came out[^h3318] of all cities[^h5892] of Israel[^h3478], singing[^h7891] and dancing[^h4246], to meet[^h7125] king[^h4428] Saul[^h7586], with tabrets[^h8596], with joy[^h8057], and with instruments[^h7991] of musick.  
###### 7
And the women[^h802] answered[^h6030] one another as they played[^h7832], and said[^h559], Saul[^h7586] hath slain[^h5221] his thousands[^h505], and David[^h1732] his ten thousands[^h7233].
###### 8
And Saul[^h7586] was very[^h3966] wroth[^h2734], and the saying[^h1697] displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] him; and he said[^h559], They have ascribed[^h5414] unto David[^h1732] ten thousands[^h7233], and to me they have ascribed[^h5414] but thousands[^h505]: and what can he have more but the kingdom[^h4410]? 
###### 9
And Saul[^h7586] eyed[^h5770] David[^h1732] from that day[^h3117] and forward[^h1973].
###### 10
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], that the evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] from God[^h430] came[^h6743] upon Saul[^h7586], and he prophesied[^h5012] in the midst[^h8432] of the house[^h1004]: and David[^h1732] played[^h5059] with his hand[^h3027], as at other times[^h3117]: and there was a javelin[^h2595] in Saul's[^h7586] hand[^h3027].
###### 11
And Saul[^h7586] cast[^h2904] the javelin[^h2595]; for he said[^h559], I will smite[^h5221] David[^h1732] even to the wall[^h7023] with it. And David[^h1732] avoided out[^h5437] of his presence[^h6440] twice[^h6471].
###### 12
And Saul[^h7586] was afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] David[^h1732], because the LORD[^h3068] was with him, and was departed[^h5493] from Saul[^h7586].
###### 13
Therefore Saul[^h7586] removed[^h5493] him from him, and made[^h7760] him his captain[^h8269] over a thousand[^h505]; and he went out[^h3318] and came in[^h935] before[^h6440] the people[^h5971].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] behaved himself wisely[^h7919] in all his ways[^h1870]; and the LORD[^h3068] was with him. 
###### 15
Wherefore when Saul[^h7586] saw[^h7200] that he behaved[^h7919] himself very[^h3966] wisely[^h7919], he was afraid[^h1481] of[^h6440] him.
###### 16
But all Israel[^h3478] and Judah[^h3063] loved[^h157] David[^h1732], because he went out[^h3318] and came in[^h935] before[^h6440] them.
###### 17
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Behold my elder[^h1419] daughter[^h1323] Merab[^h4764], her will I give[^h5414] thee to wife[^h802]: only be thou valiant[^h1121] [^h2428] for me, and fight[^h3898] the LORD'S[^h3068] battles[^h4421]. For Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Let not mine hand[^h3027] be upon him, but let the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430] be upon him. 
###### 18
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], Who am I? and what is my life[^h2416], or my father's[^h1] family[^h4940] in Israel[^h3478], that I should be son in law[^h2860] to the king[^h4428]?
###### 19
But it came to pass at the time[^h6256] when Merab[^h4764] Saul's[^h7586] daughter[^h1323] should have been given[^h5414] to David[^h1732], that she was given[^h5414] unto Adriel[^h5741] the Meholathite[^h4259] to wife[^h802].
###### 20
And Michal[^h4324] Saul's[^h7586] daughter[^h1323] loved[^h157] David[^h1732]: and they told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586], and the thing[^h1697] pleased[^h3474] [^h5869] him. 
###### 21
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], I will give[^h5414] him her, that she may be a snare[^h4170] to him, and that the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430] may be against him. Wherefore Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Thou shalt this day[^h3117] be my son in law[^h2859] in the one of the twain[^h8147].
###### 22
And Saul[^h7586] commanded[^h6680] his servants[^h5650], saying, Commune[^h1696] with David[^h1732] secretly[^h3909], and say[^h559], Behold, the king[^h4428] hath delight[^h2654] in thee, and all his servants[^h5650] love[^h157] thee: now therefore be the king's[^h4428] son in law[^h2859].
###### 23
And Saul's[^h7586] servants[^h5650] spake[^h1696] those words[^h1697] in the ears[^h241] of David[^h1732]. And David[^h1732] said[^h559], Seemeth[^h5869] it to you a light[^h7043] thing to be a king's[^h4428] son in law[^h2859], seeing that I am a poor[^h7326] man[^h376], and lightly esteemed[^h7034]?
###### 24
And the servants[^h5650] of Saul[^h7586] told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], On this manner[^h1697] spake[^h1696] David[^h1732]. 
###### 25
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Thus shall ye say[^h559] to David[^h1732], The king[^h4428] desireth[^h2656] not any dowry[^h4119], but an hundred[^h3967] foreskins[^h6190] of the Philistines[^h6430], to be avenged[^h5358] of the king's[^h4428] enemies[^h341]. But Saul[^h7586] thought[^h2803] to make David[^h1732] fall[^h5307] by the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 26
And when his servants[^h5650] told[^h5046] David[^h1732] these words[^h1697], it pleased[^h3474] [^h1697] [^h5869] David[^h1732] well to be the king's[^h4428] son in law[^h2859]: and the days[^h3117] were not expired[^h4390]. 
###### 27
Wherefore David[^h1732] arose[^h6965] and went[^h3212], he and his men[^h582], and slew[^h5221] of the Philistines[^h6430] two hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]; and David[^h1732] brought[^h935] their foreskins[^h6190], and they gave them in full tale[^h4390] to the king[^h4428], that he might be the king's[^h4428] son in law[^h2859]. And Saul[^h7586] gave[^h5414] him Michal[^h4324] his daughter[^h1323] to wife[^h802].
###### 28
And Saul[^h7586] saw[^h7200] and knew[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] was with David[^h1732], and that Michal[^h4324] Saul's[^h7586] daughter[^h1323] loved[^h157] him.
###### 29
And Saul[^h7586] was yet the more[^h3254] afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] David[^h1732]; and Saul[^h7586] became David's[^h1732] enemy[^h341] continually[^h3117].
###### 30
Then the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430] went forth[^h3318]: and it came to pass, after[^h1767] they went forth[^h3318], that David[^h1732] behaved himself more wisely[^h7919] than all the servants[^h5650] of Saul[^h7586]; so that his name[^h8034] was much[^h3966] set by[^h3365].

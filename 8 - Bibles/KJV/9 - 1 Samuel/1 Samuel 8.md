###### 1
And it came to pass, when Samuel[^h8050] was old[^h2204], that he made[^h7760] his sons[^h1121] judges[^h8199] over Israel[^h3478].
###### 2
Now the name[^h8034] of his firstborn[^h1121] [^h1060] was Joel[^h3100]; and the name[^h8034] of his second[^h4932], Abiah[^h29]: they were judges[^h8199] in Beersheba[^h884].
###### 3
And his sons[^h1121] walked[^h1980] not in his ways[^h1870], but turned aside[^h5186] after[^h310] lucre[^h1215], and took[^h3947] bribes[^h7810], and perverted[^h5186] judgment[^h4941].
###### 4
Then all the elders[^h2205] of Israel[^h3478] gathered themselves together[^h6908], and came[^h935] to Samuel[^h8050] unto Ramah[^h7414],
###### 5
And said[^h559] unto him, Behold, thou art old[^h2204], and thy sons[^h1121] walk[^h1980] not in thy ways[^h1870]: now make[^h7760] us a king[^h4428] to judge[^h8199] us like all the nations[^h1471].
###### 6
But the thing[^h1697] displeased[^h3415] [^h5869] Samuel[^h8050], when they said[^h559], Give[^h5414] us a king[^h4428] to judge[^h8199] us. And Samuel[^h8050] prayed[^h6419] unto the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 7
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], Hearken[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of the people[^h5971] in all that they say[^h559] unto thee: for they have not rejected[^h3988] thee, but they have rejected[^h3988] me, that I should not reign[^h4427] over them.
###### 8
According to all the works[^h4639] which they have done[^h6213] since the day[^h3117] that I brought them up[^h5927] out of Egypt[^h4714] even unto this day[^h3117], wherewith they have forsaken[^h5800] me, and served[^h5647] other[^h312] gods[^h430], so do[^h6213] they also unto thee.
###### 9
Now therefore hearken[^h8085] unto their voice[^h6963]: howbeit[^h389] yet protest[^h5749] solemnly[^h5749] unto them, and shew[^h5046] them the manner[^h4941] of the king[^h4428] that shall reign[^h4427] over them.  
###### 10
And Samuel[^h8050] told[^h559] all the words[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] unto the people[^h5971] that asked[^h7592] of him a king[^h4428].
###### 11
And he said[^h559], This will be the manner[^h4941] of the king[^h4428] that shall reign[^h4427] over you: He will take[^h3947] your sons[^h1121], and appoint[^h7760] them for himself, for his chariots[^h4818], and to be his horsemen[^h6571]; and some shall run[^h7323] before[^h6440] his chariots[^h4818].
###### 12
And he will appoint[^h7760] him captains[^h8269] over thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] over fifties[^h2572]; and will set them to ear[^h2790] his ground[^h2758], and to reap[^h7114] his harvest[^h7105], and to make[^h6213] his instruments[^h3627] of war[^h4421], and instruments[^h3627] of his chariots[^h7393].
###### 13
And he will take[^h3947] your daughters[^h1323] to be confectionaries[^h7548], and to be cooks[^h2879], and to be bakers[^h644].
###### 14
And he will take[^h3947] your fields[^h7704], and your vineyards[^h3754], and your oliveyards[^h2132], even the best[^h2896] of them, and give[^h5414] them to his servants[^h5650].
###### 15
And he will take the tenth[^h6237] of your seed[^h2233], and of your vineyards[^h3754], and give[^h5414] to his officers[^h5631], and to his servants[^h5650]. 
###### 16
And he will take[^h3947] your menservants[^h5650], and your maidservants[^h8198], and your goodliest[^h2896] young men[^h970], and your asses[^h2543], and put[^h6213] them to his work[^h4399].
###### 17
He will take the tenth[^h6237] of your sheep[^h6629]: and ye shall be his servants[^h5650].
###### 18
And ye shall cry out[^h2199] in that day[^h3117] because[^h6440] of your king[^h4428] which ye shall have chosen[^h977] you; and the LORD[^h3068] will not hear[^h6030] you in that day[^h3117].
###### 19
Nevertheless the people[^h5971] refused[^h3985] to obey[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of Samuel[^h8050]; and they said[^h559], Nay; but we will have a king[^h4428] over us;
###### 20
That we also may be like all the nations[^h1471]; and that our king[^h4428] may judge[^h8199] us, and go out[^h3318] before[^h6440] us, and fight[^h3898] our battles[^h4421].
###### 21
And Samuel[^h8050] heard[^h8085] all the words[^h1697] of the people[^h5971], and he rehearsed[^h1696] them in the ears[^h241] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to Samuel[^h8050], Hearken[^h8085] unto their voice[^h6963], and make[^h4427] them a king[^h4428]. And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478], Go[^h3212] ye every man[^h376] unto his city[^h5892].

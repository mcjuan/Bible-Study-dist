###### 1
Now the Philistines[^h6430] gathered together[^h622] their armies[^h4264] to battle[^h4421], and were gathered together[^h622] at Shochoh[^h7755], which belongeth to Judah[^h3063], and pitched[^h2583] between Shochoh[^h7755] and Azekah[^h5825], in Ephesdammim[^h658]. 
###### 2
And Saul[^h7586] and the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] were gathered together[^h622], and pitched[^h2583] by the valley[^h6010] of Elah[^h425], and set the battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186] against[^h7125] the Philistines[^h6430]. 
###### 3
And the Philistines[^h6430] stood[^h5975] on a mountain[^h2022] on the one side, and Israel[^h3478] stood[^h5975] on a mountain[^h2022] on the other side: and there was a valley[^h1516] between them.
###### 4
And there went out[^h3318] a champion[^h376] [^h1143] out of the camp[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430], named[^h8034] Goliath[^h1555], of Gath[^h1661], whose height[^h1363] was six[^h8337] cubits[^h520] and a span[^h2239].
###### 5
And he had an helmet[^h3553] of brass[^h5178] upon his head[^h7218], and he was armed[^h3847] with a coat[^h8302] of mail[^h7193]; and the weight[^h4948] of the coat[^h8302] was five[^h2568] thousand[^h505] shekels[^h8255] of brass[^h5178]. 
###### 6
And he had greaves[^h4697] of brass[^h5178] upon his legs[^h7272], and a target[^h3591] of brass[^h5178] between his shoulders[^h3802]. 
###### 7
And the staff[^h6086] [^h2671] of his spear[^h2595] was like a weaver's[^h707] beam[^h4500]; and his spear's[^h2595] head[^h3852] weighed six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] shekels[^h8255] of iron[^h1270]: and one bearing[^h5375] a shield[^h6793] went[^h1980] before[^h6440] him.
###### 8
And he stood[^h5975] and cried[^h7121] unto the armies[^h4634] of Israel[^h3478], and said[^h559] unto them, Why are ye come out[^h3318] to set your battle[^h4421] in array[^h6186]? am not I a Philistine[^h6430], and ye servants[^h5650] to Saul[^h7586]? choose[^h1262] you a man[^h376] for you, and let him come down[^h3381] to me.
###### 9
If he be able[^h3201] to fight[^h3898] with me, and to kill[^h5221] me, then will we be your servants[^h5650]: but if I prevail[^h3201] against him, and kill[^h5221] him, then shall ye be our servants[^h5650], and serve[^h5647] us.
###### 10
And the Philistine[^h6430] said[^h559], I defy[^h2778] the armies[^h4634] of Israel[^h3478] this day[^h3117]; give[^h5414] me a man[^h376], that we may fight[^h3898] together[^h3162].
###### 11
When Saul[^h7586] and all Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] those words[^h1697] of the Philistine[^h6430], they were dismayed[^h2865], and greatly[^h3966] afraid[^h3372].
###### 12
Now David[^h1732] was the son[^h1121] of that Ephrathite[^h376] [^h673] of Bethlehemjudah[^h1035] [^h3063], whose name[^h8034] was Jesse[^h3448]; and he had eight[^h8083] sons[^h1121]: and the man[^h376] went[^h935] among men[^h582] for an old man[^h2204] in the days[^h3117] of Saul[^h7586].
###### 13
And the three[^h7969] eldest[^h1419] sons[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] went[^h3212] and followed[^h310] Saul[^h7586] to the battle[^h4421]: and the names[^h8034] of his three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] that went[^h1980] to the battle[^h4421] were Eliab[^h446] the firstborn[^h1060], and next[^h4932] unto him Abinadab[^h41], and the third[^h7992] Shammah[^h8048].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] was the youngest[^h6996]: and the three[^h7969] eldest[^h1419] followed[^h1980] [^h310] Saul[^h7586].
###### 15
But David[^h1732] went[^h1980] and returned[^h7725] from Saul[^h7586] to feed[^h7462] his father's[^h1] sheep[^h6629] at Bethlehem[^h1035].
###### 16
And the Philistine[^h6430] drew near[^h5066] morning[^h7925] and evening[^h6150], and presented[^h3320] himself forty[^h705] days[^h3117].
###### 17
And Jesse[^h3448] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732] his son[^h1121], Take[^h3947] now for thy brethren[^h251] an ephah[^h374] of this[^h2088] parched[^h7039] corn, and these ten[^h6235] loaves[^h3899], and run[^h7323] to the camp[^h4264] to thy brethren[^h251];
###### 18
And carry[^h935] these ten[^h6235] cheeses[^h2461] [^h2757] unto the captain[^h8269] of their thousand[^h505], and look[^h6485] how thy brethren[^h251] fare[^h7965], and take[^h3947] their pledge[^h6161].  
###### 19
Now Saul[^h7586], and they, and all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], were in the valley[^h6010] of Elah[^h425], fighting[^h3898] with the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 20
And David[^h1732] rose up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and left[^h5203] the sheep[^h6629] with a keeper[^h8104], and took[^h5375], and went[^h3212], as Jesse[^h3448] had commanded[^h6680] him; and he came[^h935] to the trench[^h4570], as the host[^h2428] was going forth[^h3318] to the fight[^h4634], and shouted[^h7321] for the battle[^h4421].  
###### 21
For Israel[^h3478] and the Philistines[^h6430] had put the battle in array[^h6186], army[^h4634] against[^h7125] army[^h4634].
###### 22
And David[^h1732] left[^h5203] his carriage[^h3627] in the hand[^h3027] of the keeper[^h8104] of the carriage[^h3627], and ran[^h7323] into the army[^h4634], and came[^h935] and saluted[^h7592] [^h7965] his brethren[^h251].  
###### 23
And as he talked[^h1696] with them, behold, there came up[^h5927] the champion[^h376] [^h1143], the Philistine[^h6430] of Gath[^h1661], Goliath[^h1555] by name[^h8034], out of the armies[^h4634] [^h4630] of the Philistines[^h6430], and spake[^h1696] according to the same[^h428] words[^h1697]: and David[^h1732] heard[^h8085] them.
###### 24
And all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478], when they saw[^h7200] the man[^h376], fled[^h5127] from him[^h6440], and were sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372]. 
###### 25
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559], Have ye seen[^h7200] this man[^h376] that is come up[^h5927]? surely to defy[^h2778] Israel[^h3478] is he come up[^h5927]: and it shall be, that the man[^h376] who killeth[^h5221] him, the king[^h4428] will enrich[^h6238] him with great[^h1419] riches[^h6239], and will give[^h5414] him his daughter[^h1323], and make[^h6213] his father's[^h1] house[^h1004] free[^h2670] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 26
And David[^h1732] spake[^h559] to the men[^h582] that stood[^h5975] by him, saying[^h559], What shall be done[^h6213] to the man[^h376] that killeth[^h5221] this[^h1975] Philistine[^h6430], and taketh away[^h5493] the reproach[^h2781] from Israel[^h3478]? for who is this uncircumcised[^h6189] Philistine[^h6430], that he should defy[^h2778] the armies[^h4634] of the living[^h2416] God[^h430]?
###### 27
And the people[^h5971] answered[^h559] him after this manner[^h1697], saying[^h559], So shall it be done[^h6213] to the man[^h376] that killeth[^h5221] him.
###### 28
And Eliab[^h446] his eldest[^h1419] brother[^h251] heard[^h8085] when he spake[^h1696] unto the men[^h582]; and Eliab's[^h446] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against David[^h1732], and he said[^h559], Why camest thou down[^h3381] hither? and with whom hast thou left[^h5203] those[^h2007] few[^h4592] sheep[^h6629] in the wilderness[^h4057]? I know[^h3045] thy pride[^h2087], and the naughtiness[^h7455] of thine heart[^h3824]; for thou art come down[^h3381] that thou mightest see[^h7200] the battle[^h4421].
###### 29
And David[^h1732] said[^h559], What have I now done[^h6213]? Is there not a cause[^h1697]?
###### 30
And he turned[^h5437] from him[^h681] toward[^h4136] another[^h312], and spake[^h559] after the same manner[^h1697]: and the people[^h5971] answered[^h1697] him again[^h7725] after the former[^h7223] manner[^h1697]. 
###### 31
And when the words[^h1697] were heard[^h8085] which David[^h1732] spake[^h1696], they rehearsed[^h5046] them before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586]: and he sent[^h3947] for him. 
###### 32
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], Let no man's[^h120] heart[^h3820] fail[^h5307] because of him; thy servant[^h5650] will go[^h3212] and fight[^h3898] with this Philistine[^h6430].
###### 33
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Thou art not able[^h3201] to go[^h3212] against this Philistine[^h6430] to fight[^h3898] with him: for thou art but a youth[^h5288], and he a man[^h376] of war[^h4421] from his youth[^h5271].
###### 34
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], Thy servant[^h5650] kept[^h7462] his father's[^h1] sheep[^h6629], and there came[^h935] a lion[^h738], and a bear[^h1677], and took[^h5375] a lamb[^h7716] [^h2089] out of the flock[^h5739]: 
###### 35
And I went out[^h3318] after[^h310] him, and smote[^h5221] him, and delivered[^h5337] it out of his mouth[^h6310]: and when he arose[^h6965] against me, I caught[^h2388] him by his beard[^h2206], and smote[^h5221] him, and slew[^h4191] him.
###### 36
Thy servant[^h5650] slew[^h5221] both the lion[^h738] and the bear[^h1677]: and this uncircumcised[^h6189] Philistine[^h6430] shall be as one[^h259] of them, seeing he hath defied[^h2778] the armies[^h4634] of the living[^h2416] God[^h430].
###### 37
David[^h1732] said[^h559] moreover, The LORD[^h3068] that delivered[^h5337] me out of the paw[^h3027] of the lion[^h738], and out of the paw[^h3027] of the bear[^h1677], he will deliver[^h5337] me out of the hand[^h3027] of this Philistine[^h6430]. And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Go[^h3212], and the LORD[^h3068] be with thee.
###### 38
And Saul[^h7586] armed[^h3847] David[^h1732] with his armour[^h4055], and he put[^h5414] an helmet[^h6959] of brass[^h5178] upon his head[^h7218]; also he armed[^h3847] him with a coat of mail[^h8302]. 
###### 39
And David[^h1732] girded[^h2296] his sword[^h2719] upon his armour[^h4055], and he assayed[^h2974] to go[^h3212]; for he had not proved[^h5254] it. And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], I cannot[^h3201] go[^h3212] with these; for I have not proved[^h5254] them. And David[^h1732] put[^h5493] them off him.
###### 40
And he took[^h3947] his staff[^h4731] in his hand[^h3027], and chose[^h977] him five[^h2568] smooth[^h2512] stones[^h68] out of the brook[^h5158], and put[^h7760] them in a shepherd's[^h7462] bag[^h3627] which he had, even in a scrip[^h3219]; and his sling[^h7050] was in his hand[^h3027]: and he drew near[^h5066] to the Philistine[^h6430].  
###### 41
And the Philistine[^h6430] came[^h3212] on[^h1980] and drew near[^h7131] unto David[^h1732]; and the man[^h376] that bare[^h5375] the shield[^h6793] went before[^h6440] him.
###### 42
And when the Philistine[^h6430] looked about[^h5027], and saw[^h7200] David[^h1732], he disdained[^h959] him: for he was but a youth[^h5288], and ruddy[^h132], and of a fair[^h3303] countenance[^h4758].
###### 43
And the Philistine[^h6430] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Am I a dog[^h3611], that thou comest[^h935] to me with staves[^h4731]? And the Philistine[^h6430] cursed[^h7043] David[^h1732] by his gods[^h430].
###### 44
And the Philistine[^h6430] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Come[^h3212] to me, and I will give[^h5414] thy flesh[^h1320] unto the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064], and to the beasts[^h929] of the field[^h7704].
###### 45
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732] to the Philistine[^h6430], Thou comest[^h935] to me with a sword[^h2719], and with a spear[^h2595], and with a shield[^h3591]: but I come[^h935] to thee in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068] of hosts[^h6635], the God[^h430] of the armies[^h4634] of Israel[^h3478], whom thou hast defied[^h2778].
###### 46
This day[^h3117] will the LORD[^h3068] deliver[^h5462] thee into mine hand[^h3027]; and I will smite[^h5221] thee, and take[^h5493] thine head[^h7218] from thee; and I will give[^h5414] the carcases[^h6297] of the host[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430] this day[^h3117] unto the fowls[^h5775] of the air[^h8064], and to the wild beasts[^h2416] of the earth[^h776]; that all the earth[^h776] may know[^h3045] that there is[^h3426] a God[^h430] in Israel[^h3478]. 
###### 47
And all this assembly[^h6951] shall know[^h3045] that the LORD[^h3068] saveth[^h3467] not with sword[^h2719] and spear[^h2595]: for the battle[^h4421] is the LORD'S[^h3068], and he will give[^h5414] you into our hands[^h3027].
###### 48
And it came to pass, when the Philistine[^h6430] arose[^h6965], and came[^h3212] and drew nigh[^h7126] to meet[^h7125] David[^h1732], that David[^h1732] hasted[^h4116], and ran[^h7323] toward the army[^h4634] to meet[^h7125] the Philistine[^h6430].
###### 49
And David[^h1732] put[^h7971] his hand[^h3027] in his bag[^h3627], and took[^h3947] thence a stone[^h68], and slang[^h7049] it, and smote[^h5221] the Philistine[^h6430] in his forehead[^h4696], that the stone[^h68] sunk[^h2883] into his forehead[^h4696]; and he fell[^h5307] upon his face[^h6440] to the earth[^h776].
###### 50
So David[^h1732] prevailed[^h2388] over[^h4480] the Philistine[^h6430] with a sling[^h7050] and with a stone[^h68], and smote[^h5221] the Philistine[^h6430], and slew[^h4191] him; but there was no sword[^h2719] in the hand[^h3027] of David[^h1732].
###### 51
Therefore David[^h1732] ran[^h7323], and stood[^h5975] upon the Philistine[^h6430], and took[^h3947] his sword[^h2719], and drew[^h8025] it out of the sheath[^h8593] thereof, and slew[^h4191] him, and cut off[^h3772] his head[^h7218] therewith. And when the Philistines[^h6430] saw[^h7200] their champion[^h1368] was dead[^h4191], they fled[^h5127].
###### 52
And the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] and of Judah[^h3063] arose[^h6965], and shouted[^h7321], and pursued[^h7291] the Philistines[^h6430], until thou come[^h935] to the valley[^h1516], and to the gates[^h8179] of Ekron[^h6138]. And the wounded[^h2491] of the Philistines[^h6430] fell down[^h5307] by the way[^h1870] to Shaaraim[^h8189], even unto Gath[^h1661], and unto Ekron[^h6138].
###### 53
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] returned[^h7725] from chasing[^h1814] after[^h310] the Philistines[^h6430], and they spoiled[^h8155] their tents[^h4264].
###### 54
And David[^h1732] took[^h3947] the head[^h7218] of the Philistine[^h6430], and brought[^h935] it to Jerusalem[^h3389]; but he put[^h7760] his armour[^h3627] in his tent[^h168].
###### 55
And when Saul[^h7586] saw[^h7200] David[^h1732] go forth[^h3318] against[^h7125] the Philistine[^h6430], he said[^h559] unto Abner[^h74], the captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635], Abner[^h74], whose son[^h1121] is this youth[^h5288]? And Abner[^h74] said[^h559], As thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], O king[^h4428], I cannot[^h518] tell[^h3045].
###### 56
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Enquire[^h7592] thou whose son[^h1121] the stripling[^h5958] is.
###### 57
And as David[^h1732] returned[^h7725] from the slaughter[^h5221] of the Philistine[^h6430], Abner[^h74] took[^h3947] him, and brought[^h935] him before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586] with the head[^h7218] of the Philistine[^h6430] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 58
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to him, Whose son[^h1121] art thou, thou young man[^h5288]? And David[^h1732] answered[^h559], I am the son[^h1121] of thy servant[^h5650] Jesse[^h3448] the Bethlehemite[^h1022].

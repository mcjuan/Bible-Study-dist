###### 1
And it came to pass, when David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] were come[^h935] to Ziklag[^h6860] on the third[^h7992] day[^h3117], that the Amalekites[^h6003] had invaded[^h6584] the south[^h5045], and Ziklag[^h6860], and smitten[^h5221] Ziklag[^h6860], and burned[^h8313] it with fire[^h784];
###### 2
And had taken the women[^h802] captives[^h7617], that were therein: they slew[^h4191] not any[^h376], either great[^h1419] or small[^h6996], but carried them away[^h5090], and went[^h3212] on their way[^h1870].
###### 3
So David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] came[^h935] to the city[^h5892], and, behold, it was burned[^h8313] with fire[^h784]; and their wives[^h802], and their sons[^h1121], and their daughters[^h1323], were taken captives[^h7617].
###### 4
Then David[^h1732] and the people[^h5971] that were with him lifted up[^h5375] their voice[^h6963] and wept[^h1058], until they had no more power[^h3581] to weep[^h1058].
###### 5
And David's[^h1732] two[^h8147] wives[^h802] were taken captives[^h7617], Ahinoam[^h293] the Jezreelitess[^h3159], and Abigail[^h26] the wife[^h802] of Nabal[^h5037] the Carmelite[^h3761].
###### 6
And David[^h1732] was greatly[^h3966] distressed[^h3334]; for the people[^h5971] spake[^h559] of stoning[^h5619] him, because the soul[^h5315] of all the people[^h5971] was grieved[^h4843], every man[^h376] for his sons[^h1121] and for his daughters[^h1323]: but David[^h1732] encouraged[^h2388] himself in the LORD[^h3068] his God[^h430]. 
###### 7
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548], Ahimelech's[^h288] son[^h1121], I pray thee, bring me hither[^h5066] the ephod[^h646]. And Abiathar[^h54] brought[^h5066] thither the ephod[^h646] to David[^h1732].
###### 8
And David[^h1732] enquired[^h7592] at the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Shall I pursue[^h7291] after[^h310] this troop[^h1416]? shall I overtake[^h5381] them? And he answered[^h559] him, Pursue[^h7291]: for thou shalt surely[^h5381] overtake[^h5381] them, and without fail[^h5337] recover[^h5337] all.
###### 9
So David[^h1732] went[^h3212], he and the six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376] that were with him, and came[^h935] to the brook[^h5158] Besor[^h1308], where those that were left behind[^h3498] stayed[^h5975].
###### 10
But David[^h1732] pursued[^h7291], he and four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]: for two hundred[^h3967] abode behind[^h5975], which were so faint[^h6296] that they could not go over[^h5674] the brook[^h5158] Besor[^h1308].
###### 11
And they found[^h4672] an Egyptian[^h376] [^h4713] in the field[^h7704], and brought[^h3947] him to David[^h1732], and gave[^h5414] him bread[^h3899], and he did eat[^h398]; and they made him drink[^h8248] water[^h4325];
###### 12
And they gave[^h5414] him a piece[^h6400] of a cake[^h1690] of figs, and two[^h8147] clusters of raisins[^h6778]: and when he had eaten[^h398], his spirit[^h7307] came again[^h7725] to him: for he had eaten[^h398] no bread[^h3899], nor drunk[^h8354] any water[^h4325], three[^h7969] days[^h3117] and three[^h7969] nights[^h3915].
###### 13
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said[^h559], I am a young man[^h5288] of Egypt[^h4713], servant[^h5650] to an Amalekite[^h376] [^h6003]; and my master[^h113] left[^h5800] me, because three[^h7969] days[^h3117] agone I fell sick[^h2470].
###### 14
We made an invasion[^h6584] upon the south[^h5045] of the Cherethites[^h3774], and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah[^h3063], and upon the south[^h5045] of Caleb[^h3612]; and we burned[^h8313] Ziklag[^h6860] with fire[^h784].
###### 15
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to him, Canst thou bring me down[^h3381] to this company[^h1416]? And he said[^h559], Swear[^h7650] unto me by God[^h430], that thou wilt neither kill[^h4191] me, nor[^h518] deliver[^h5462] me into the hands[^h3027] of my master[^h113], and I will bring thee down[^h3381] to this company[^h1416].
###### 16
And when he had brought him down[^h3381], behold, they were spread abroad[^h5203] upon all[^h6440] the earth[^h776], eating[^h398] and drinking[^h8354], and dancing[^h2287], because of all the great[^h1419] spoil[^h7998] that they had taken[^h3947] out of the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430], and out of the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 17
And David[^h1732] smote[^h5221] them from the twilight[^h5399] even unto the evening[^h6153] of the next day[^h4283]: and there escaped[^h4422] not a man[^h376] of them, save four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] young[^h5288] men[^h376], which rode[^h7392] upon camels[^h1581], and fled[^h5127]. 
###### 18
And David[^h1732] recovered[^h5337] all that the Amalekites[^h6002] had carried away[^h3947]: and David[^h1732] rescued[^h5337] his two[^h8147] wives[^h802].
###### 19
And there was nothing lacking[^h5737] to them, neither[^h4480] small[^h6996] nor great[^h1419], neither sons[^h1121] nor daughters[^h1323], neither spoil[^h7998], nor any thing that they had taken[^h3947] to them: David[^h1732] recovered[^h7725] all.
###### 20
And David[^h1732] took[^h3947] all the flocks[^h6629] and the herds[^h1241], which they drave[^h5090] before[^h6440] those[^h1931] other cattle[^h4735], and said[^h559], This is David's[^h1732] spoil[^h7998].
###### 21
And David[^h1732] came[^h935] to the two hundred[^h3967] men[^h582], which were so faint[^h6296] that they could not follow[^h3212] [^h310] David[^h1732], whom they had made also to abide[^h3427] at the brook[^h5158] Besor[^h1308]: and they went forth[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] David[^h1732], and to meet[^h7125] the people[^h5971] that were with him: and when David[^h1732] came near[^h5066] to the people[^h5971], he saluted[^h7592] [^h7965] them. 
###### 22
Then answered[^h6030] all the wicked[^h7451] men[^h376] and men of Belial[^h1100], of those[^h582] that went[^h1980] with David[^h1732], and said[^h559], Because they went[^h1980] not with us, we will not give[^h5414] them ought of the spoil[^h7998] that we have recovered[^h5337], save to every man[^h376] his wife[^h802] and his children[^h1121], that they may lead them away[^h5090], and depart[^h3212]. 
###### 23
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732], Ye shall not do so[^h6213], my brethren[^h251], with that which the LORD[^h3068] hath given[^h5414] us, who hath preserved[^h8104] us, and delivered[^h5414] the company[^h1416] that came[^h935] against us into our hand[^h3027].
###### 24
For who will hearken[^h8085] unto you in this matter[^h1697]? but as his part[^h2506] is that goeth down[^h3381] [^h3381] to the battle[^h4421], so shall his part[^h2506] be that tarrieth[^h3427] by the stuff[^h3627]: they shall part[^h2505] alike[^h3162].
###### 25
And it was so from that day[^h3117] forward[^h4605], that he made[^h7760] it a statute[^h2706] and an ordinance[^h4941] for Israel[^h3478] unto this day[^h3117]. 
###### 26
And when David[^h1732] came[^h935] to Ziklag[^h6860], he sent[^h7971] of the spoil[^h7998] unto the elders[^h2205] of Judah[^h3063], even to his friends[^h7453], saying[^h559], Behold a present[^h1293] for you of the spoil[^h7998] of the enemies[^h341] of the LORD[^h3068]; 
###### 27
To them [^h834] which were in Bethel[^h1008], and to them which were in south[^h5045] Ramoth[^h7418], and to them which were in Jattir[^h3492],
###### 28
And to them which were in Aroer[^h6177], and to them which were in Siphmoth[^h8224], and to them which were in Eshtemoa[^h851],
###### 29
And to them which were in Rachal[^h7403], and to them which were in the cities[^h5892] of the Jerahmeelites[^h3397], and to them which were in the cities[^h5892] of the Kenites[^h7017],
###### 30
And to them which were in Hormah[^h2767], and to them which were in Chorashan[^h3565], and to them which were in Athach[^h6269],
###### 31
And to them which were in Hebron[^h2275], and to all the places[^h4725] where David[^h1732] himself and his men[^h582] were wont to haunt[^h1980].

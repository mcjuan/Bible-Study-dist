###### 1
And Hannah[^h2584] prayed[^h6419], and said[^h559], My heart[^h3820] rejoiceth[^h5970] in the LORD[^h3068], mine horn[^h7161] is exalted[^h7311] in the LORD[^h3068]: my mouth[^h6310] is enlarged[^h7337] over mine enemies[^h341]; because I rejoice[^h8055] in thy salvation[^h3444].
###### 2
There is none holy[^h6918] as the LORD[^h3068]: for there is none beside[^h1115] thee: neither is there any rock[^h6697] like our God[^h430].
###### 3
Talk[^h1696] no more[^h7235] so exceeding[^h1364] proudly[^h1364]; let not arrogancy[^h6277] come[^h3318] out of your mouth[^h6310]: for the LORD[^h3068] is a God[^h410] of knowledge[^h1844], and by him actions[^h5949] are weighed[^h8505]. 
###### 4
The bows[^h7198] of the mighty men[^h1368] are broken[^h2844], and they that stumbled[^h3782] are girded[^h247] with strength[^h2428].
###### 5
They that were full[^h7649] have hired out[^h7936] themselves for bread[^h3899]; and they that were hungry[^h7457] ceased[^h2308]: so that the barren[^h6135] hath born[^h3205] seven[^h7651]; and she that hath many[^h7227] children[^h1121] is waxed feeble[^h535].
###### 6
The LORD[^h3068] killeth[^h4191], and maketh alive[^h2421]: he bringeth down[^h3381] to the grave[^h7585], and bringeth up[^h5927].
###### 7
The LORD[^h3068] maketh poor[^h3423], and maketh rich[^h6238]: he bringeth low[^h8213], and[^h637] lifteth up[^h7311].
###### 8
He raiseth up[^h6965] the poor[^h1800] out of the dust[^h6083], and lifteth up[^h7311] the beggar[^h34] from the dunghill[^h830], to set[^h3427] them among princes[^h5081], and to make them inherit[^h5157] the throne[^h3678] of glory[^h3519]: for the pillars[^h4690] of the earth[^h776] are the LORD'S[^h3068], and he hath set[^h7896] the world[^h8398] upon them.
###### 9
He will keep[^h8104] the feet[^h7272] of his saints[^h2623], and the wicked[^h7563] shall be silent[^h1826] in darkness[^h2822]; for by strength[^h3581] shall no man[^h376] prevail[^h1396].
###### 10
The adversaries[^h7378] of the LORD[^h3068] shall be broken to pieces[^h2865]; out of heaven[^h8064] shall he thunder[^h7481] upon them: the LORD[^h3068] shall judge[^h1777] the ends[^h657] of the earth[^h776]; and he shall give[^h5414] strength[^h5797] unto his king[^h4428], and exalt[^h7311] the horn[^h7161] of his anointed[^h4899].
###### 11
And Elkanah[^h511] went[^h3212] to Ramah[^h7414] to his house[^h1004]. And the child[^h5288] did[^h1961] minister[^h8334] unto the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] Eli[^h5941] the priest[^h3548].
###### 12
Now the sons[^h1121] of Eli[^h5941] were sons[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100]; they knew[^h3045] not the LORD[^h3068].
###### 13
And the priests'[^h3548] custom[^h4941] with the people[^h5971] was, that, when any man[^h376] offered[^h2076] sacrifice[^h2077], the priest's[^h3548] servant[^h5288] came[^h935], while the flesh[^h1320] was in seething[^h1310], with a fleshhook[^h4207] of three[^h7969] teeth[^h8127] in his hand[^h3027];
###### 14
And he struck[^h5221] it into the pan[^h3595], or kettle[^h1731], or caldron[^h7037], or pot[^h6517]; all that the fleshhook[^h4207] brought up[^h5927] the priest[^h3548] took[^h3947] for himself. So they did[^h6213] in Shiloh[^h7887] unto all the Israelites[^h3478] that came[^h935] thither.
###### 15
Also before they burnt[^h6999] the fat[^h2459], the priest's[^h3548] servant[^h5288] came[^h935], and said[^h559] to the man[^h376] that sacrificed[^h2076], Give[^h5414] flesh[^h1320] to roast[^h6740] for the priest[^h3548]; for he will not have[^h3947] sodden[^h1310] flesh[^h1320] of thee, but raw[^h2416].
###### 16
And if any man[^h376] said[^h559] unto him, Let them not fail[^h6999] to burn[^h6999] the fat[^h2459] presently[^h3117], and then take[^h3947] as much as thy soul[^h5315] desireth[^h183]; then he would answer[^h559] him, Nay; but thou shalt give[^h5414] it me now: and if not, I will take[^h3947] it by force[^h2394]. 
###### 17
Wherefore the sin[^h2403] of the young men[^h5288] was very[^h3966] great[^h1419] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: for men[^h582] abhorred[^h5006] the offering[^h4503] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 18
But Samuel[^h8050] ministered[^h8334] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], being a child[^h5288], girded[^h2296] with a linen[^h906] ephod[^h646].
###### 19
Moreover his mother[^h517] made[^h6213] him a little[^h6996] coat[^h4598], and brought[^h5927] it to him from year[^h3117] to year[^h3117], when she came up[^h5927] with her husband[^h376] to offer[^h2076] the yearly[^h3117] sacrifice[^h2077].
###### 20
And Eli[^h5941] blessed[^h1288] Elkanah[^h511] and his wife[^h802], and said[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] give[^h7760] thee seed[^h2233] of this woman[^h802] for the loan[^h7596] which is lent[^h7592] to the LORD[^h3068]. And they went[^h1980] unto their own home[^h4725]. 
###### 21
And[^h3588] the LORD[^h3068] visited[^h6485] Hannah[^h2584], so that she conceived[^h2029], and bare[^h3205] three[^h7969] sons[^h1121] and two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323]. And the child[^h5288] Samuel[^h8050] grew[^h1431] before[^h5973] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 22
Now Eli[^h5941] was very[^h3966] old[^h2204], and heard[^h8085] all that his sons[^h1121] did[^h6213] unto all Israel[^h3478]; and how they lay[^h7901] with the women[^h802] that assembled[^h6633] at the door[^h6607] of the tabernacle[^h168] of the congregation[^h4150]. 
###### 23
And he said[^h559] unto them, Why do[^h6213] ye such things[^h1697]? for I hear[^h8085] of your evil[^h7451] dealings[^h1697] by all this people[^h5971]. 
###### 24
Nay, my sons[^h1121]; for it is no good[^h2896] report[^h8052] that I hear[^h8085]: ye make the LORD'S[^h3068] people[^h5971] to transgress[^h5674]. 
###### 25
If one man[^h376] sin[^h2398] against another[^h376], the judge[^h430] shall judge[^h6419] him: but if a man[^h376] sin[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], who shall intreat[^h6419] for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened[^h8085] not unto the voice[^h6963] of their father[^h1], because the LORD[^h3068] would[^h2654] slay[^h4191] them.
###### 26
And the child[^h5288] Samuel[^h8050] grew[^h1432] on[^h1980], and was in favour[^h2896] both with the LORD[^h3068], and also with men[^h582].
###### 27
And there came[^h935] a man[^h376] of God[^h430] unto Eli[^h5941], and said[^h559] unto him, Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068], Did I plainly[^h1540] appear[^h1540] unto the house[^h1004] of thy father[^h1], when they were in Egypt[^h4714] in Pharaoh's[^h6547] house[^h1004]?
###### 28
And did I choose[^h977] him out of all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to be my priest[^h3548], to offer[^h5927] upon mine altar[^h4196], to burn[^h6999] incense[^h7004], to wear[^h5375] an ephod[^h646] before[^h6440] me? and did I give[^h5414] unto the house[^h1004] of thy father[^h1] all the offerings made by fire[^h801] of the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478]?
###### 29
Wherefore kick[^h1163] ye at my sacrifice[^h2077] and at mine offering[^h4503], which I have commanded[^h6680] in my habitation[^h4583]; and honourest[^h3513] thy sons[^h1121] above me, to make yourselves fat[^h1254] with the chiefest[^h7225] of all the offerings[^h4503] of Israel[^h3478] my people[^h5971]?
###### 30
Wherefore the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478] saith[^h5002], I said[^h559] indeed[^h559] that thy house[^h1004], and the house[^h1004] of thy father[^h1], should walk[^h1980] before[^h6440] me for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]: but now the LORD[^h3068] saith[^h5002], Be it far from me[^h2486]; for them that honour[^h3513] me I will honour[^h3513], and they that despise[^h959] me shall be lightly esteemed[^h7043].
###### 31
Behold, the days[^h3117] come[^h935], that I will cut off[^h1438] thine arm[^h2220], and the arm[^h2220] of thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004], that there shall not be an old man[^h2205] in thine house[^h1004].
###### 32
And thou shalt see[^h5027] an enemy[^h6862] in my habitation[^h4583], in all the wealth which God shall give[^h3190] Israel[^h3478]: and there shall not be an old man[^h2205] in thine house[^h1004] for ever[^h3117]. 
###### 33
And the man[^h376] of thine, whom I shall not cut off[^h3772] from mine altar[^h4196], shall be to consume[^h3615] thine eyes[^h5869], and to grieve[^h109] thine heart[^h5315]: and all the increase[^h4768] of thine house[^h1004] shall die[^h4191] in the flower of their age[^h582]. 
###### 34
And this shall be a sign[^h226] unto thee, that shall come[^h935] upon thy two[^h8147] sons[^h1121], on Hophni[^h2652] and Phinehas[^h6372]; in one[^h259] day[^h3117] they shall die[^h4191] both[^h8147] of them.
###### 35
And I will raise me up[^h6965] a faithful[^h539] priest[^h3548], that shall do[^h6213] according to that which is in mine heart[^h3824] and in my mind[^h5315]: and I will build[^h1129] him a sure[^h539] house[^h1004]; and he shall walk[^h1980] before[^h6440] mine anointed[^h4899] for ever[^h3117].
###### 36
And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left[^h3498] in thine house[^h1004] shall come[^h935] and crouch[^h7812] to him for a piece[^h95] of silver[^h3701] and a morsel[^h3603] of bread[^h3899], and shall say[^h559], Put[^h5596] me, I pray thee, into one[^h259] of the priests' offices[^h3550], that I may eat[^h398] a piece[^h6595] of bread[^h3899].

###### 1
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], How long wilt thou mourn[^h56] for Saul[^h7586], seeing I have rejected[^h3988] him from reigning[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478]? fill[^h4390] thine horn[^h7161] with oil[^h8081], and go[^h3212], I will send[^h7971] thee to Jesse[^h3448] the Bethlehemite[^h1022]: for I have provided[^h7200] me a king[^h4428] among his sons[^h1121].
###### 2
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559], How can I go[^h3212]? if Saul[^h7586] hear[^h8085] it, he will kill[^h2026] me. And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Take[^h3947] an heifer[^h1241] [^h5697] with thee[^h3027], and say[^h559], I am come[^h935] to sacrifice[^h2076] to the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 3
And call[^h7121] Jesse[^h3448] to the sacrifice[^h2077], and I will shew[^h3045] thee what thou shalt do[^h6213]: and thou shalt anoint[^h4886] unto me him whom I name[^h559] unto thee.
###### 4
And Samuel[^h8050] did[^h6213] that which the LORD[^h3068] spake[^h1696], and came[^h935] to Bethlehem[^h1035]. And the elders[^h2205] of the town[^h5892] trembled[^h2729] at his coming[^h7125], and said[^h559], Comest[^h935] thou peaceably[^h7965]? 
###### 5
And he said[^h559], Peaceably[^h7965]: I am come[^h935] to sacrifice[^h2076] unto the LORD[^h3068]: sanctify[^h6942] yourselves, and come[^h935] with me to the sacrifice[^h2077]. And he sanctified[^h6942] Jesse[^h3448] and his sons[^h1121], and called[^h7121] them to the sacrifice[^h2077].
###### 6
And it came to pass, when they were come[^h935], that he looked[^h7200] on Eliab[^h446], and said[^h559], Surely the LORD'S[^h3068] anointed[^h4899] is before him. 
###### 7
But the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], Look[^h5027] not on his countenance[^h4758], or on the height[^h1364] of his stature[^h6967]; because I have refused[^h3988] him: for the LORD seeth not as man[^h120] seeth[^h7200]; for man[^h120] looketh[^h7200] on the outward appearance[^h5869], but the LORD[^h3068] looketh[^h7200] on the heart[^h3824]. 
###### 8
Then Jesse[^h3448] called[^h7121] Abinadab[^h41], and made him pass[^h5674] before[^h6440] Samuel[^h8050]. And he said[^h559], Neither hath the LORD[^h3068] chosen[^h977] this.
###### 9
Then Jesse[^h3448] made Shammah[^h8048] to pass by[^h5674]. And he said[^h559], Neither hath the LORD[^h3068] chosen[^h977] this.
###### 10
Again, Jesse[^h3448] made seven[^h7651] of his sons[^h1121] to pass[^h5674] before[^h6440] Samuel[^h8050]. And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto Jesse[^h3448], The LORD[^h3068] hath not chosen[^h977] these.
###### 11
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto Jesse[^h3448], Are here all[^h8552] thy children[^h5288]? And he said[^h559], There remaineth[^h7604] yet the youngest[^h6996], and, behold, he keepeth[^h7462] the sheep[^h6629]. And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto Jesse[^h3448], Send[^h7971] and fetch[^h3947] him: for we will not sit down[^h5437] till he come[^h935] hither[^h6311]. 
###### 12
And he sent[^h7971], and brought him in[^h935]. Now he was ruddy[^h132], and withal[^h5973] of a beautiful[^h3303] countenance[^h5869], and goodly[^h2896] to look to[^h7210]. And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], Arise[^h6965], anoint[^h4886] him: for this is he. 
###### 13
Then Samuel[^h8050] took[^h3947] the horn[^h7161] of oil[^h8081], and anointed[^h4886] him in the midst[^h7130] of his brethren[^h251]: and the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] came[^h6743] upon David[^h1732] from that day[^h3117] forward[^h4605]. So Samuel[^h8050] rose up[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to Ramah[^h7414].
###### 14
But the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] departed[^h5493] from Saul[^h7586], and an evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] from the LORD[^h3068] troubled[^h1204] him. 
###### 15
And Saul's[^h7586] servants[^h5650] said[^h559] unto him, Behold now, an evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] from God[^h430] troubleth[^h1204] thee.
###### 16
Let our lord[^h113] now command[^h559] thy servants[^h5650], which are before[^h6440] thee, to seek out[^h1245] a man[^h376], who is a cunning[^h3045] player[^h5059] on an harp[^h3658]: and it shall come to pass, when the evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] from God[^h430] is upon thee, that he shall play[^h5059] with his hand[^h3027], and thou shalt be well[^h2895].
###### 17
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650], Provide[^h7200] me now a man[^h376] that can play[^h5059] well[^h3190], and bring[^h935] him to me.
###### 18
Then answered[^h6030] one[^h259] of the servants[^h5288], and said[^h559], Behold, I have seen[^h7200] a son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] the Bethlehemite[^h1022], that is cunning[^h3045] in playing[^h5059], and a mighty[^h1368] valiant man[^h2428], and a man[^h376] of war[^h4421], and prudent[^h995] in matters[^h1697], and a comely[^h8389] person[^h376], and the LORD[^h3068] is with him. 
###### 19
Wherefore Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto Jesse[^h3448], and said[^h559], Send[^h7971] me David[^h1732] thy son[^h1121], which is with the sheep[^h6629].
###### 20
And Jesse[^h3448] took[^h3947] an ass[^h2543] laden with bread[^h3899], and a bottle[^h4997] of wine[^h3196], and a[^h259] kid[^h1423] [^h5795], and sent[^h7971] them by[^h3027] David[^h1732] his son[^h1121] unto Saul[^h7586].
###### 21
And David[^h1732] came[^h935] to Saul[^h7586], and stood[^h5975] before[^h6440] him: and he loved[^h157] him greatly[^h3966]; and he became his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627].
###### 22
And Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] to Jesse[^h3448], saying[^h559], Let David[^h1732], I pray thee, stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] me; for he hath found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in my sight[^h5869].
###### 23
And it came to pass, when the evil spirit[^h7307] from God[^h430] was upon Saul[^h7586], that David[^h1732] took[^h3947] an harp[^h3658], and played[^h5059] with his hand[^h3027]: so Saul[^h7586] was refreshed[^h7304], and was well[^h2895], and the evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] departed[^h5493] from him.

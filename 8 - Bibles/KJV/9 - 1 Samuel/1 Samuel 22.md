###### 1
David[^h1732] therefore departed[^h3212] thence, and escaped[^h4422] to the cave[^h4631] Adullam[^h5725]: and when his brethren[^h251] and all his father's[^h1] house[^h1004] heard[^h8085] it, they went down[^h3381] thither to him.
###### 2
And every one[^h376] that was in distress[^h4689], and every one[^h376] that was in debt[^h5378], and every one[^h376] that was discontented[^h4751] [^h5315], gathered[^h6908] themselves unto him; and he became a captain[^h8269] over them: and there were with him about four[^h702] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376].  
###### 3
And David[^h1732] went[^h3212] thence to Mizpeh[^h4708] of Moab[^h4124]: and he said[^h559] unto the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], Let my father[^h1] and my mother[^h517], I pray thee, come forth[^h3318], and be with you, till I know[^h3045] what God[^h430] will do[^h6213] for me.
###### 4
And he brought[^h5148] them before[^h6440] the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124]: and they dwelt[^h3427] with him all the while[^h3117] that David[^h1732] was in the hold[^h4686].
###### 5
And the prophet[^h5030] Gad[^h1410] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Abide[^h3427] not in the hold[^h4686]; depart[^h3212], and get[^h935] thee into the land[^h776] of Judah[^h3063]. Then David[^h1732] departed[^h3212], and came[^h935] into the forest[^h3293] of Hareth[^h2802].
###### 6
When Saul[^h7586] heard[^h8085] that David[^h1732] was discovered[^h3045], and the men[^h582] that were with him, (now Saul[^h7586] abode[^h3427] in Gibeah[^h1390] under a tree[^h815] in Ramah[^h7414], having his spear[^h2595] in his hand[^h3027], and all his servants[^h5650] were standing[^h5324] about him;) 
###### 7
Then Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto his servants[^h5650] that stood[^h5324] about him, Hear now[^h8085], ye Benjamites[^h1145]; will the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] give[^h5414] every one of you fields[^h7704] and vineyards[^h3754], and make[^h7760] you all captains[^h8269] of thousands[^h505], and captains[^h8269] of hundreds[^h3967];
###### 8
That all of you have conspired[^h7194] against me, and there is none that sheweth[^h1540] [^h241] me that my son[^h1121] hath made a league[^h3772] with the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448], and there is none of you that is sorry[^h2470] for me, or sheweth[^h1540] [^h241] unto me that my son[^h1121] hath stirred up[^h6965] my servant[^h5650] against me, to lie in wait[^h693], as at this day[^h3117]? 
###### 9
Then answered[^h6030] Doeg[^h1673] the Edomite[^h130], which was set[^h5324] over the servants[^h5650] of Saul[^h7586], and said[^h559], I saw[^h7200] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] coming[^h935] to Nob[^h5011], to Ahimelech[^h288] the son[^h1121] of Ahitub[^h285].
###### 10
And he enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068] for him, and gave[^h5414] him victuals[^h6720], and gave[^h5414] him the sword[^h2719] of Goliath[^h1555] the Philistine[^h6430].
###### 11
Then the king[^h4428] sent[^h7971] to call[^h7121] Ahimelech[^h288] the priest[^h3548], the son[^h1121] of Ahitub[^h285], and all his father's[^h1] house[^h1004], the priests[^h3548] that were in Nob[^h5011]: and they came[^h935] all of them to the king[^h4428].
###### 12
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Hear[^h8085] now, thou son[^h1121] of Ahitub[^h285]. And he answered[^h559], Here I am, my lord[^h113]. 
###### 13
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto him, Why have ye conspired[^h7194] against me, thou and the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448], in that thou hast given[^h5414] him bread[^h3899], and a sword[^h2719], and hast enquired[^h7592] of God[^h430] for him, that he should rise[^h6965] against me, to lie in wait[^h693], as at this day[^h3117]?
###### 14
Then Ahimelech[^h288] answered[^h6030] the king[^h4428], and said[^h559], And who is so faithful[^h539] among all thy servants[^h5650] as David[^h1732], which is the king's[^h4428] son in law[^h2860], and goeth[^h5493] at thy bidding[^h4928], and is honourable[^h3513] in thine house[^h1004]?
###### 15
Did I then[^h3117] begin[^h2490] to enquire[^h7592] of God[^h430] for him? be it far from me[^h2486]: let not the king[^h4428] impute[^h7760] any thing[^h1697] unto his servant[^h5650], nor to all the house[^h1004] of my father[^h1]: for thy servant[^h5650] knew[^h3045] nothing[^h1697] of all this, less[^h6996] or more[^h1419]. 
###### 16
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559], Thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191], Ahimelech[^h288], thou, and all thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004].
###### 17
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto the footmen[^h7323] that stood[^h5324] about him, Turn[^h5437], and slay[^h4191] the priests[^h3548] of the LORD[^h3068]; because their hand[^h3027] also is with David[^h1732], and because they knew[^h3045] when he fled[^h1272], and did not shew[^h1540] [^h241] it to me. But the servants[^h5650] of the king[^h4428] would[^h14] not put forth[^h7971] their hand[^h3027] to fall[^h6293] upon the priests[^h3548] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 18
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] to Doeg[^h1673], Turn[^h5437] thou, and fall[^h6293] upon the priests[^h3548]. And Doeg[^h1673] the Edomite[^h130] turned[^h5437], and he fell[^h6293] upon the priests[^h3548], and slew[^h4191] on that day[^h3117] fourscore[^h8084] and five[^h2568] persons[^h376] that did wear[^h5375] a linen[^h906] ephod[^h646].
###### 19
And Nob[^h5011], the city[^h5892] of the priests[^h3548], smote[^h5221] he with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719], both men[^h376] and women[^h802], children[^h5768] and sucklings[^h3243], and oxen[^h7794], and asses[^h2543], and sheep[^h7716], with the edge[^h6310] of the sword[^h2719].
###### 20
And one[^h259] of the sons[^h1121] of Ahimelech[^h288] the son[^h1121] of Ahitub[^h285], named[^h8034] Abiathar[^h54], escaped[^h4422], and fled[^h1272] after[^h310] David[^h1732].
###### 21
And Abiathar[^h54] shewed[^h5046] David[^h1732] that Saul[^h7586] had slain[^h2026] the LORD'S[^h3068] priests[^h3548].
###### 22
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Abiathar[^h54], I knew[^h3045] it that day[^h3117], when Doeg[^h1673] the Edomite[^h130] was there, that he would surely[^h5046] tell[^h5046] Saul[^h7586]: I have occasioned[^h5437] the death of all the persons[^h5315] of thy father's[^h1] house[^h1004].
###### 23
Abide[^h3427] thou with me, fear[^h3372] not: for he that seeketh[^h1245] my life[^h5315] seeketh[^h1245] thy life[^h5315]: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard[^h4931].

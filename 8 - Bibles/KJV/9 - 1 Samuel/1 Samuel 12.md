###### 1
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto all Israel[^h3478], Behold, I have hearkened[^h8085] unto your voice[^h6963] in all that ye said[^h559] unto me, and have made[^h4427] a king[^h4428] over you.
###### 2
And now, behold, the king[^h4428] walketh[^h1980] before[^h6440] you: and I am old[^h2204] and grayheaded[^h7867]; and, behold, my sons[^h1121] are with you: and I have walked[^h1980] before[^h6440] you from my childhood[^h5271] unto this day[^h3117].
###### 3
Behold, here I am: witness[^h6030] against me before the LORD[^h3068], and before his anointed[^h4899]: whose ox[^h7794] have I taken[^h3947]? or whose ass[^h2543] have I taken[^h3947]? or whom have I defrauded[^h6231]? whom have I oppressed[^h7533]? or of whose hand[^h3027] have I received any bribe[^h3724] to blind[^h5956] mine eyes[^h5869] therewith? and I will restore[^h7725] it you.  
###### 4
And they said[^h559], Thou hast not defrauded[^h6231] us, nor oppressed[^h7533] us, neither hast thou taken[^h3947] ought[^h3972] of any man's[^h376] hand[^h3027].
###### 5
And he said[^h559] unto them, The LORD[^h3068] is witness[^h5707] against you, and his anointed[^h4899] is witness[^h5707] this day[^h3117], that ye have not found[^h4672] ought[^h3972] in my hand[^h3027]. And they answered[^h559], He is witness[^h5707].
###### 6
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], It is the LORD[^h3068] that advanced[^h6213] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], and that brought[^h5927] your fathers[^h1] up[^h5927] out of the land[^h776] of Egypt[^h4714]. 
###### 7
Now therefore stand still[^h3320], that I may reason[^h8199] with you before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] of all the righteous acts[^h6666] of the LORD[^h3068], which he did[^h6213] to you and to your fathers[^h1].  
###### 8
When Jacob[^h3290] was come[^h935] into Egypt[^h4714], and your fathers[^h1] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068], then the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] Moses[^h4872] and Aaron[^h175], which brought forth[^h3318] your fathers[^h1] out of Egypt[^h4714], and made them dwell[^h3427] in this place[^h4725].
###### 9
And when they forgat[^h7911] the LORD[^h3068] their God[^h430], he sold[^h4376] them into the hand[^h3027] of Sisera[^h5516], captain[^h8269] of the host[^h6635] of Hazor[^h2674], and into the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430], and into the hand[^h3027] of the king[^h4428] of Moab[^h4124], and they fought[^h3898] against them.
###### 10
And they cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068], and said[^h559], We have sinned[^h2398], because we have forsaken[^h5800] the LORD[^h3068], and have served[^h5647] Baalim[^h1168] and Ashtaroth[^h6252]: but now deliver[^h5337] us out of the hand[^h3027] of our enemies[^h341], and we will serve[^h5647] thee.
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h7971] Jerubbaal[^h3378], and Bedan[^h917], and Jephthah[^h3316], and Samuel[^h8050], and delivered[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of your enemies[^h341] on every side[^h5439], and ye dwelled[^h3427] safe[^h983].
###### 12
And when ye saw[^h7200] that Nahash[^h5176] the king[^h4428] of the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983] came[^h935] against you, ye said[^h559] unto me, Nay; but a king[^h4428] shall reign[^h4427] over us: when the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430] was your king[^h4428].
###### 13
Now therefore behold the king[^h4428] whom ye have chosen[^h977], and whom ye have desired[^h7592]! and, behold, the LORD[^h3068] hath set[^h5414] a king[^h4428] over you.
###### 14
If ye will fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068], and serve[^h5647] him, and obey[^h8085] his voice[^h6963], and not rebel[^h4784] against the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], then shall both ye and also the king[^h4428] that reigneth[^h4427] over you continue following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068] your God[^h430]:  
###### 15
But if ye will not obey[^h8085] the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], but rebel[^h4784] against the commandment[^h6310] of the LORD[^h3068], then shall the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] be against you, as it was against your fathers[^h1].
###### 16
Now therefore[^h1571] stand[^h3320] and see[^h7200] this great[^h1419] thing[^h1697], which the LORD[^h3068] will do[^h6213] before your eyes[^h5869].
###### 17
Is it not wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105] to day[^h3117]? I will call[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068], and he shall send[^h5414] thunder[^h6963] and rain[^h4306]; that ye may perceive[^h3045] and see[^h7200] that your wickedness[^h7451] is great[^h7227], which ye have done[^h6213] in the sight[^h5869] of the LORD[^h3068], in asking[^h7592] you a king[^h4428].
###### 18
So Samuel[^h8050] called[^h7121] unto the LORD[^h3068]; and the LORD[^h3068] sent[^h5414] thunder[^h6963] and rain[^h4306] that day[^h3117]: and all the people[^h5971] greatly[^h3966] feared[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068] and Samuel[^h8050].
###### 19
And all the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], Pray[^h6419] for thy servants[^h5650] unto the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], that we die[^h4191] not: for we have added[^h3254] unto all our sins[^h2403] this evil[^h7451], to ask[^h7592] us a king[^h4428].
###### 20
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto the people[^h5971], Fear[^h3372] not: ye have done[^h6213] all this wickedness[^h7451]: yet turn not aside[^h5493] from following[^h310] the LORD[^h3068], but serve[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] with all your heart[^h3824];
###### 21
And turn ye not aside[^h5493]: for then should ye go after[^h310] vain[^h8414] things, which cannot profit[^h3276] nor deliver[^h5337]; for they are vain[^h8414].
###### 22
For the LORD[^h3068] will not forsake[^h5203] his people[^h5971] for his great[^h1419] name's[^h8034] sake: because it hath pleased[^h2974] the LORD[^h3068] to make[^h6213] you his people[^h5971].
###### 23
Moreover as for me[^h595], God forbid[^h2486] that I should sin[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068] in ceasing[^h2308] to pray[^h6419] for you: but I will teach[^h3384] you the good[^h2896] and the right[^h3477] way[^h1870]: 
###### 24
Only fear[^h3372] the LORD[^h3068], and serve[^h5647] him in truth[^h571] with all your heart[^h3824]: for consider[^h7200] how great things he hath done[^h1431] for you. 
###### 25
But if ye shall still[^h7489] do wickedly[^h7489], ye shall be consumed[^h5595], both ye and your king[^h4428].

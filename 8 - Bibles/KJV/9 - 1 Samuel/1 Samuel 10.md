###### 1
Then Samuel[^h8050] took[^h3947] a vial[^h6378] of oil[^h8081], and poured[^h3332] it upon his head[^h7218], and kissed[^h5401] him, and said[^h559], Is it not because the LORD[^h3068] hath anointed[^h4886] thee to be captain[^h5057] over his inheritance[^h5159]?
###### 2
When thou art departed[^h3212] from me[^h5978] to day[^h3117], then thou shalt find[^h4672] two[^h8147] men[^h582] by Rachel's[^h7354] sepulchre[^h6900] in the border[^h1366] of Benjamin[^h1144] at Zelzah[^h6766]; and they will say[^h559] unto thee, The asses[^h860] which thou wentest[^h1980] to seek[^h1245] are found[^h4672]: and, lo, thy father[^h1] hath left[^h5203] the care[^h1697] of the asses[^h860], and sorroweth[^h1672] for you, saying[^h559], What shall I do[^h6213] for my son[^h1121]? 
###### 3
Then shalt thou go on[^h2498] forward[^h1973] from thence, and thou shalt come[^h935] to the plain[^h436] of Tabor[^h8396], and there shall meet[^h4672] thee three[^h7969] men[^h582] going up[^h5927] to God[^h430] to Bethel[^h1008], one[^h259] carrying[^h5375] three[^h7969] kids[^h1423], and another[^h259] carrying[^h5375] three[^h7969] loaves[^h3603] of bread[^h3899], and another[^h259] carrying[^h5375] a bottle[^h5035] of wine[^h3196]:
###### 4
And they will[^h7592] salute[^h7965] thee, and give[^h5414] thee two[^h8147] loaves of bread[^h3899]; which thou shalt receive[^h3947] of their hands[^h3027]. 
###### 5
After[^h310] that thou shalt come[^h935] to the hill[^h1389] of God[^h430], where is the garrison[^h5333] of the Philistines[^h6430]: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither[^h935] to the city[^h5892], that thou shalt meet[^h6293] a company[^h2256] of prophets[^h5030] coming down[^h3381] from the high place[^h1116] with a psaltery[^h5035], and a tabret[^h8596], and a pipe[^h2485], and a harp[^h3658], before[^h6440] them; and they shall prophesy[^h5012]:
###### 6
And the Spirit[^h7307] of the LORD[^h3068] will come[^h6743] upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy[^h5012] with them, and shalt be turned[^h2015] into another[^h312] man[^h376].
###### 7
And let it be, when these signs[^h226] are come[^h935] unto thee, that thou do[^h6213] as occasion[^h4672] serve[^h3027] thee; for God[^h430] is with thee.  
###### 8
And thou shalt go down[^h3381] before[^h6440] me to Gilgal[^h1537]; and, behold, I will come down[^h3381] unto thee, to offer[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930], and to sacrifice[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002]: seven[^h7651] days[^h3117] shalt thou tarry[^h3176], till I come[^h935] to thee, and shew[^h3045] thee what thou shalt do[^h6213].
###### 9
And it was so, that when he had turned[^h6437] his back[^h7926] to go[^h3212] from Samuel[^h8050], God[^h430] gave[^h2015] him another[^h312] heart[^h3820]: and all those signs[^h226] came[^h935] to pass that day[^h3117].  
###### 10
And when they came[^h935] thither to the hill[^h1389], behold, a company[^h2256] of prophets[^h5030] met[^h7125] him; and the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] came[^h6743] upon him, and he prophesied[^h5012] among[^h8432] them.
###### 11
And it came to pass, when all that knew[^h3045] him beforetime[^h865] [^h8032] saw[^h7200] that, behold, he prophesied[^h5012] among the prophets[^h5030], then the people[^h5971] said[^h559] one[^h376] to another[^h7453], What is this that is come unto the son[^h1121] of Kish[^h7027]? Is Saul[^h7586] also among the prophets[^h5030]? 
###### 12
And one[^h376] of the same place answered[^h6030] and said[^h559], But who is their father[^h1]? Therefore it became a proverb[^h4912], Is Saul[^h7586] also among the prophets[^h5030]? 
###### 13
And when he had made an end[^h3615] of prophesying[^h5012], he came[^h935] to the high place[^h1116].
###### 14
And Saul's[^h7586] uncle[^h1730] said[^h559] unto him and to his servant[^h5288], Whither[^h575] went[^h1980] ye? And he said[^h559], To seek[^h1245] the asses[^h860]: and when we saw[^h7200] that they were no where[^h369], we came[^h935] to Samuel[^h8050].
###### 15
And Saul's[^h7586] uncle[^h1730] said[^h559], Tell[^h5046] me, I pray thee, what Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] unto you.
###### 16
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto his uncle[^h1730], He told[^h5046] us plainly[^h5046] that the asses[^h860] were found[^h4672]. But of the matter[^h1697] of the kingdom[^h4410], whereof Samuel[^h8050] spake[^h559], he told[^h5046] him not.
###### 17
And Samuel[^h8050] called[^h6817] the people[^h5971] together unto the LORD[^h3068] to Mizpeh[^h4709];
###### 18
And said[^h559] unto the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478], Thus saith[^h559] the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], I brought up[^h5927] Israel[^h3478] out of Egypt[^h4714], and delivered[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of the Egyptians[^h4714], and out of the hand[^h3027] of all kingdoms[^h4467], and of them that oppressed[^h3905] you:
###### 19
And ye have this day[^h3117] rejected[^h3988] your God[^h430], who himself saved[^h3467] you out of all your adversities[^h7451] and your tribulations[^h6869]; and ye have said[^h559] unto him, Nay, but set[^h7760] a king[^h4428] over us. Now therefore present[^h3320] yourselves before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] by your tribes[^h7626], and by your thousands[^h505].
###### 20
And when Samuel[^h8050] had caused all the tribes[^h7626] of Israel[^h3478] to come near[^h7126], the tribe[^h7626] of Benjamin[^h1144] was taken[^h3920].
###### 21
When he had caused the tribe[^h7626] of Benjamin[^h1144] to come near[^h7126] by their families[^h4940], the family[^h4940] of Matri[^h4309] was taken[^h3920], and Saul[^h7586] the son[^h1121] of Kish[^h7027] was taken[^h3920]: and when they sought[^h1245] him, he could not be found[^h4672].
###### 22
Therefore they enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068] further, if the man[^h376] should yet come[^h935] thither[^h1988]. And the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h559], Behold, he hath hid[^h2244] himself among the stuff[^h3627].
###### 23
And they ran[^h7323] and fetched[^h3947] him thence: and when he stood[^h3320] among[^h8432] the people[^h5971], he was higher[^h1361] than any of the people[^h5971] from his shoulders[^h7926] and upward[^h4605].
###### 24
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] to all the people[^h5971], See[^h7200] ye him whom the LORD[^h3068] hath chosen[^h977], that there is none like him among all the people[^h5971]? And all the people[^h5971] shouted[^h7321], and said[^h559], God save[^h2421] the king[^h4428]. 
###### 25
Then Samuel[^h8050] told[^h1696] the people[^h5971] the manner[^h4941] of the kingdom[^h4410], and wrote[^h3789] it in a book[^h5612], and laid it up[^h3240] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]. And Samuel[^h8050] sent[^h7971] all the people[^h5971] away[^h7971], every man[^h376] to his house[^h1004].
###### 26
And Saul[^h7586] also went[^h1980] home[^h1004] to Gibeah[^h1390]; and there went[^h3212] with him a band of men[^h2428], whose hearts[^h3820] God[^h430] had touched[^h5060].
###### 27
But the children[^h1121] of Belial[^h1100] said[^h559], How shall this man save[^h3467] us? And they despised[^h959] him, and brought[^h935] him no presents[^h4503]. But he held his peace[^h2790].

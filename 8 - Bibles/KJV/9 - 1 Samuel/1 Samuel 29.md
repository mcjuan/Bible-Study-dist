###### 1
Now the Philistines[^h6430] gathered together[^h6908] all their armies[^h4264] to Aphek[^h663]: and the Israelites[^h3478] pitched[^h2583] by a fountain[^h5869] which is in Jezreel[^h3157].
###### 2
And the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] passed on[^h5674] by hundreds[^h3967], and by thousands[^h505]: but David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] passed on[^h5674] in the rereward[^h314] with Achish[^h397].
###### 3
Then said[^h559] the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430], What do these Hebrews[^h5680] here? And Achish[^h397] said[^h559] unto the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430], Is not this David[^h1732], the servant[^h5650] of Saul[^h7586] the king[^h4428] of Israel[^h3478], which hath been with me these days[^h3117], or these years[^h8141], and I have found[^h4672] no fault[^h3972] in him since[^h3117] he fell[^h5307] unto me unto this day[^h3117]?
###### 4
And the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430] were wroth[^h7107] with him; and the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430] said[^h559] unto him, Make[^h7725] this fellow[^h376] return[^h7725], that he may go again[^h7725] to his place[^h4725] which thou hast appointed[^h6485] him, and let him not go down[^h3381] with us to battle[^h4421], lest in the battle[^h4421] he be an adversary[^h7854] to us: for wherewith should he reconcile[^h7521] himself unto his master[^h113]? should it not be with the heads[^h7218] of these men[^h582]?
###### 5
Is not this David[^h1732], of whom they sang[^h6030] one to another in dances[^h4246], saying[^h559], Saul[^h7586] slew[^h5221] his thousands[^h505], and David[^h1732] his ten thousands[^h7233]?
###### 6
Then Achish[^h397] called[^h7121] David[^h1732], and said[^h559] unto him, Surely, as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], thou hast been upright[^h3477], and thy going out[^h3318] and thy coming in[^h935] with me in the host[^h4264] is good[^h2896] in my sight[^h5869]: for I have not found[^h4672] evil[^h7451] in thee since the day[^h3117] of thy coming[^h935] unto me unto this day[^h3117]: nevertheless the lords[^h5633] favour[^h2896] thee not[^h5869]. 
###### 7
Wherefore now return[^h7725], and go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965], that thou displease[^h6213] [^h7451] [^h5869] not the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430]. 
###### 8
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Achish[^h397], But what have I done[^h6213]? and what hast thou found[^h4672] in thy servant[^h5650] so long as[^h3117] I have been with thee[^h6440] unto this day[^h3117], that I may not go[^h935] fight[^h3898] against the enemies[^h341] of my lord[^h113] the king[^h4428]? 
###### 9
And Achish[^h397] answered[^h6030] and said[^h559] to David[^h1732], I know[^h3045] that thou art good[^h2896] in my sight[^h5869], as an angel[^h4397] of God[^h430]: notwithstanding the princes[^h8269] of the Philistines[^h6430] have said[^h559], He shall not go up[^h5927] with us to the battle[^h4421].
###### 10
Wherefore now rise up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242] with thy master's[^h113] servants[^h5650] that are come[^h935] with thee: and as soon as ye be up early[^h7925] in the morning[^h1242], and have light[^h215], depart[^h3212].
###### 11
So David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] rose up early[^h7925] to depart[^h3212] in the morning[^h1242], to return[^h7725] into the land[^h776] of the Philistines[^h6430]. And the Philistines[^h6430] went up[^h5927] to Jezreel[^h3157].

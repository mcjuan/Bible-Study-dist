###### 1
Then they told[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Behold, the Philistines[^h6430] fight[^h3898] against Keilah[^h7084], and they rob[^h8154] the threshingfloors[^h1637].
###### 2
Therefore David[^h1732] enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], Shall I go[^h3212] and smite[^h5221] these Philistines[^h6430]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Go[^h3212], and smite[^h5221] the Philistines[^h6430], and save[^h3467] Keilah[^h7084].
###### 3
And David's[^h1732] men[^h582] said[^h559] unto him, Behold, we be afraid[^h3373] here in Judah[^h3063]: how much more then if we come[^h3212] to Keilah[^h7084] against the armies[^h4634] of the Philistines[^h6430]?
###### 4
Then David[^h1732] enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068] yet again[^h3254]. And the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] him and said[^h559], Arise[^h6965], go down[^h3381] to Keilah[^h7084]; for I will deliver[^h5414] the Philistines[^h6430] into thine hand[^h3027].
###### 5
So David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] went[^h3212] to Keilah[^h7084], and fought[^h3898] with the Philistines[^h6430], and brought away[^h5090] their cattle[^h4735], and smote[^h5221] them with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]. So David[^h1732] saved[^h3467] the inhabitants[^h3427] of Keilah[^h7084].
###### 6
And it came to pass, when Abiathar[^h54] the son[^h1121] of Ahimelech[^h288] fled[^h1272] to David[^h1732] to Keilah[^h7084], that he came down[^h3381] with an ephod[^h646] in his hand[^h3027].
###### 7
And it was told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586] that David[^h1732] was come[^h935] to Keilah[^h7084]. And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], God[^h430] hath delivered[^h5234] him into mine hand[^h3027]; for he is shut in[^h5462], by entering[^h935] into a town[^h5892] that hath gates[^h1817] and bars[^h1280].
###### 8
And Saul[^h7586] called[^h8085] all the people[^h5971] together[^h8085] to war[^h4421], to go down[^h3381] to Keilah[^h7084], to besiege[^h6696] David[^h1732] and his men[^h582].
###### 9
And David[^h1732] knew[^h3045] that Saul[^h7586] secretly practised[^h2790] mischief[^h7451] against him; and he said[^h559] to Abiathar[^h54] the priest[^h3548], Bring hither[^h5066] the ephod[^h646].
###### 10
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], thy servant[^h5650] hath certainly[^h8085] heard[^h8085] that Saul[^h7586] seeketh[^h1245] to come[^h935] to Keilah[^h7084], to destroy[^h7843] the city[^h5892] for my sake.
###### 11
Will the men[^h1167] of Keilah[^h7084] deliver me up[^h5462] into his hand[^h3027]? will Saul[^h7586] come down[^h3381], as thy servant[^h5650] hath heard[^h8085]? O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], I beseech thee, tell[^h5046] thy servant[^h5650]. And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], He will come down[^h3381].
###### 12
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732], Will the men[^h1167] of Keilah[^h7084] deliver[^h5462] me and my men[^h582] into the hand[^h3027] of Saul[^h7586]? And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559], They will deliver thee up[^h5462]. 
###### 13
Then David[^h1732] and his men[^h582], which were about six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] [^h376], arose[^h6965] and departed[^h3318] out of Keilah[^h7084], and went[^h1980] whithersoever[^h834] they could go[^h1980]. And it was told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586] that David[^h1732] was escaped[^h4422] from Keilah[^h7084]; and he forbare[^h2308] to go forth[^h3318].
###### 14
And David[^h1732] abode[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057] in strong holds[^h4679], and remained[^h3427] in a mountain[^h2022] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Ziph[^h2128]. And Saul[^h7586] sought[^h1245] him every day[^h3117], but God[^h430] delivered[^h5414] him not into his hand[^h3027].
###### 15
And David[^h1732] saw[^h7200] that Saul[^h7586] was come out[^h3318] to seek[^h1245] his life[^h5315]: and David[^h1732] was in the wilderness[^h4057] of Ziph[^h2128] in a wood[^h2793].
###### 16
And Jonathan[^h3083] Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121] arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to David[^h1732] into the wood[^h2793], and strengthened[^h2388] his hand[^h3027] in God[^h430].
###### 17
And he said[^h559] unto him, Fear[^h3372] not: for the hand[^h3027] of Saul[^h7586] my father[^h1] shall not find[^h4672] thee; and thou shalt be king[^h4427] over Israel[^h3478], and I shall be next[^h4932] unto thee; and that also Saul[^h7586] my father[^h1] knoweth[^h3045].
###### 18
And they two[^h8147] made[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: and David[^h1732] abode[^h3427] in the wood[^h2793], and Jonathan[^h3083] went[^h1980] to his house[^h1004].
###### 19
Then came up[^h5927] the Ziphites[^h2130] to Saul[^h7586] to Gibeah[^h1390], saying[^h559], Doth not David[^h1732] hide[^h5641] himself with us in strong holds[^h4679] in the wood[^h2793], in the hill[^h1389] of Hachilah[^h2444], which is on the south[^h3225] of Jeshimon[^h3452]?  
###### 20
Now therefore, O king[^h4428], come down[^h3381] according to all the desire[^h185] of thy soul[^h5315] to come down[^h3381]; and our part shall be to deliver[^h5462] him into the king's[^h4428] hand[^h3027].
###### 21
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Blessed[^h1288] be ye of the LORD[^h3068]; for ye have compassion[^h2550] on me.
###### 22
Go[^h3212], I pray you, prepare[^h3559] yet, and know[^h3045] and see[^h7200] his place[^h4725] where his haunt[^h7272] is, and who hath seen[^h7200] him there: for it is told[^h559] me that he dealeth very[^h6191] subtilly[^h6191]. 
###### 23
See[^h7200] therefore, and take knowledge[^h3045] of all the lurking places[^h4224] where he hideth[^h2244] himself, and come ye again[^h7725] to me with the certainty[^h3559], and I will go[^h1980] with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be[^h3426] in the land[^h776], that I will search[^h2664] him out throughout all the thousands[^h505] of Judah[^h3063].
###### 24
And they arose[^h6965], and went[^h3212] to Ziph[^h2128] before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586]: but David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] were in the wilderness[^h4057] of Maon[^h4584], in the plain[^h6160] on the south[^h3225] of Jeshimon[^h3452].
###### 25
Saul[^h7586] also and his men[^h582] went[^h3212] to seek[^h1245] him. And they told[^h5046] David[^h1732]: wherefore he came down[^h3381] into a rock[^h5553], and abode[^h3427] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Maon[^h4584]. And when Saul[^h7586] heard[^h8085] that, he pursued[^h7291] after[^h310] David[^h1732] in the wilderness[^h4057] of Maon[^h4584]. 
###### 26
And Saul[^h7586] went[^h3212] on this side[^h6654] of the mountain[^h2022], and David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] on that side[^h6654] of the mountain[^h2022]: and David[^h1732] made haste[^h2648] to get away[^h3212] for fear[^h6440] of Saul[^h7586]; for Saul[^h7586] and his men[^h582] compassed[^h5849] David[^h1732] and his men[^h582] round about[^h5849] to take[^h8610] them.
###### 27
But there came[^h935] a messenger[^h4397] unto Saul[^h7586], saying[^h559], Haste[^h4116] thee, and come[^h3212]; for the Philistines[^h6430] have invaded[^h6584] the land[^h776]. 
###### 28
Wherefore Saul[^h7586] returned[^h7725] from pursuing[^h7291] after[^h310] David[^h1732], and went[^h3212] against[^h7125] the Philistines[^h6430]: therefore they called[^h7121] that place[^h4725] Selahammahlekoth[^h5555]. 
###### 29
And David[^h1732] went up[^h5927] from thence, and dwelt[^h3427] in strong holds[^h4679] at Engedi[^h5872].

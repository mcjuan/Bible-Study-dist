###### 1
And David[^h1732] fled[^h1272] from Naioth[^h5121] in Ramah[^h7414], and came[^h935] and said[^h559] before[^h6440] Jonathan[^h3083], What have I done[^h6213]? what is mine iniquity[^h5771]? and what is my sin[^h2403] before[^h6440] thy father[^h1], that he seeketh[^h1245] my life[^h5315]?
###### 2
And he said[^h559] unto him, God forbid[^h2486]; thou shalt not die[^h4191]: behold, my father[^h1] will do[^h6213] [^h6213] nothing[^h1697] either great[^h1419] or small[^h6996], but that he will shew[^h1540] [^h241] it me: and why should my father[^h1] hide[^h5641] this thing[^h1697] from me? it is not so. 
###### 3
And David[^h1732] sware[^h7650] moreover, and said[^h559], Thy father[^h1] certainly[^h3045] knoweth[^h3045] that I have found[^h4672] grace[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869]; and he saith[^h559], Let not Jonathan[^h3083] know[^h3045] this, lest he be grieved[^h6087]: but truly[^h199] as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], and as thy soul[^h5315] liveth[^h2416], there is but a step[^h6587] between me and death[^h4194].
###### 4
Then said[^h559] Jonathan[^h3083] unto David[^h1732], Whatsoever thy soul[^h5315] desireth[^h559], I will even do[^h6213] it for thee.  
###### 5
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Jonathan[^h3083], Behold, to morrow[^h4279] is the new moon[^h2320], and I should not fail[^h3427] to sit[^h3427] with the king[^h4428] at meat[^h398]: but let me go[^h7971], that I may hide[^h5641] myself in the field[^h7704] unto the third[^h7992] day at even[^h6153].
###### 6
If thy father[^h1] at all[^h6485] miss[^h6485] me, then say[^h559], David[^h1732] earnestly[^h7592] asked[^h7592] leave of me that he might run[^h7323] to Bethlehem[^h1035] his city[^h5892]: for there is a yearly[^h3117] sacrifice[^h2077] there for all the family[^h4940]. 
###### 7
If he say[^h559] thus, It is well[^h2896]; thy servant[^h5650] shall have peace[^h7965]: but if he be very[^h2734] wroth[^h2734], then be sure[^h3045] that evil[^h7451] is determined[^h3615] by him.
###### 8
Therefore thou shalt deal[^h6213] kindly[^h2617] with thy servant[^h5650]; for thou hast brought[^h935] thy servant[^h5650] into a covenant[^h1285] of the LORD[^h3068] with thee: notwithstanding, if there be[^h3426] in me iniquity[^h5771], slay[^h4191] me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring[^h935] me to thy father[^h1]?
###### 9
And Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559], Far be it from thee[^h2486]: for if I knew[^h3045] certainly[^h3045] that evil[^h7451] were determined[^h3615] by my father[^h1] to come[^h935] upon thee, then would not I tell[^h5046] it thee?
###### 10
Then said[^h559] David[^h1732] to Jonathan[^h3083], Who shall tell[^h5046] me? or what if thy father[^h1] answer[^h6030] thee roughly[^h7186]?
###### 11
And Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Come[^h3212], and let us go out[^h3318] into the field[^h7704]. And they went out[^h3318] both[^h8147] of them into the field[^h7704].
###### 12
And Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], O LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], when I have sounded[^h2713] my father[^h1] about to morrow[^h4279] any time[^h6256], or the third[^h7992] day, and, behold, if there be good[^h2895] toward David[^h1732], and I then send[^h7971] not unto thee, and shew[^h1540] [^h241] it thee;  
###### 13
The LORD[^h3068] do[^h6213] so[^h3541] and much more[^h3254] to Jonathan[^h3083]: but if it please[^h3190] my father[^h1] to do thee evil[^h7451], then I will shew[^h1540] [^h241] it thee, and send thee away[^h7971], that thou mayest go[^h1980] in peace[^h7965]: and the LORD[^h3068] be with thee, as he hath been with my father[^h1]. 
###### 14
And thou shalt not only while yet[^h518] I live[^h2416] shew[^h6213] me the kindness[^h2617] of the LORD[^h3068], that I die[^h4191] not:
###### 15
But also thou shalt not cut off[^h3772] thy kindness[^h2617] from my house[^h1004] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]: no, not when the LORD[^h3068] hath cut off[^h3772] the enemies[^h341] of David[^h1732] every one[^h376] from the face[^h6440] of the earth[^h127].
###### 16
So Jonathan[^h3083] made[^h3772] a covenant with the house[^h1004] of David[^h1732], saying, Let the LORD[^h3068] even require[^h1245] it at the hand[^h3027] of David's[^h1732] enemies[^h341]. 
###### 17
And Jonathan[^h3083] caused David[^h1732] to swear[^h7650] again[^h3254], because he loved[^h160] him: for he loved[^h157] him as he loved[^h160] his own soul[^h5315]. 
###### 18
Then Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], To morrow[^h4279] is the new moon[^h2320]: and thou shalt be missed[^h6485], because thy seat[^h4186] will be empty[^h6485]. 
###### 19
And when thou hast stayed three days[^h8027], then thou shalt go down[^h3381] quickly[^h3966], and come[^h935] to the place[^h4725] where thou didst hide[^h5641] thyself when[^h3117] the business[^h4639] was in hand, and shalt remain[^h3427] by[^h681] the stone[^h68] Ezel[^h237].   
###### 20
And I will shoot[^h3384] three[^h7969] arrows[^h2671] on the side[^h6654] thereof, as though I shot[^h7971] at a mark[^h4307].
###### 21
And, behold, I will send[^h7971] a lad[^h5288], saying, Go[^h3212], find out[^h4672] the arrows[^h2671]. If I expressly[^h559] say[^h559] unto the lad[^h5288], Behold, the arrows[^h2671] are on this side of thee, take[^h3947] them; then come[^h935] thou: for there is peace[^h7965] to thee, and no hurt[^h1697]; as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416]. 
###### 22
But if I say[^h559] thus unto the young man[^h5958], Behold, the arrows[^h2671] are beyond[^h1973] thee; go thy way[^h3212]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath sent thee away[^h7971].
###### 23
And as touching the matter[^h1697] which thou and I have spoken[^h1696] of, behold, the LORD[^h3068] be between thee and me for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 24
So David[^h1732] hid[^h5641] himself in the field[^h7704]: and when the new moon[^h2320] was come, the king[^h4428] sat him down[^h3427] to eat[^h398] meat[^h3899].
###### 25
And the king[^h4428] sat[^h3427] upon his seat[^h4186], as at other times[^h6471], even upon a seat[^h4186] by the wall[^h7023]: and Jonathan[^h3083] arose[^h6965], and Abner[^h74] sat[^h3427] by Saul's[^h7586] side[^h6654], and David's[^h1732] place[^h4725] was empty[^h6485].
###### 26
Nevertheless Saul[^h7586] spake[^h1696] not any thing[^h3972] that day[^h3117]: for he thought[^h559], Something hath befallen[^h4745] him, he is not[^h1115] clean[^h2889]; surely he is not clean[^h2889].
###### 27
And it came to pass on the morrow[^h4283], which was the second[^h8145] day of the month[^h2320], that David's[^h1732] place[^h4725] was empty[^h6485]: and Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto Jonathan[^h3083] his son[^h1121], Wherefore cometh[^h935] not the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] to meat[^h3899], neither yesterday[^h8543], nor to day[^h3117]?
###### 28
And Jonathan[^h3083] answered[^h6030] Saul[^h7586], David[^h1732] earnestly[^h7592] asked[^h7592] leave of me[^h5978] to go to Bethlehem[^h1035]:
###### 29
And he said[^h559], Let me go[^h7971], I pray thee; for our family[^h4940] hath a sacrifice[^h2077] in the city[^h5892]; and my brother[^h251], he hath commanded[^h6680] me to be there: and now, if I have found[^h4672] favour[^h2580] in thine eyes[^h5869], let me get away[^h4422], I pray thee, and see[^h7200] my brethren[^h251]. Therefore he cometh[^h935] not unto the king's[^h4428] table[^h7979].
###### 30
Then Saul's[^h7586] anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] against Jonathan[^h3083], and he said[^h559] unto him, Thou son[^h1121] of the perverse[^h5753] rebellious[^h4780] woman, do not I know[^h3045] that thou hast chosen[^h977] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] to thine own confusion[^h1322], and unto the confusion[^h1322] of thy mother's[^h517] nakedness[^h6172]? 
###### 31
For as long as[^h3117] the son[^h1121] of Jesse[^h3448] liveth[^h2425] upon the ground[^h127], thou shalt not be established[^h3559], nor thy kingdom[^h4438]. Wherefore now send[^h7971] and fetch[^h3947] him unto me, for he shall surely die[^h1121] [^h4194]. 
###### 32
And Jonathan[^h3083] answered[^h6030] Saul[^h7586] his father[^h1], and said[^h559] unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain[^h4191]? what hath he done[^h6213]?
###### 33
And Saul[^h7586] cast[^h2904] a javelin[^h2595] at him to smite[^h5221] him: whereby Jonathan[^h3083] knew[^h3045] that it was determined[^h3617] of his father[^h1] to slay[^h4191] David[^h1732].
###### 34
So Jonathan[^h3083] arose[^h6965] from the table[^h7979] in fierce[^h2750] anger[^h639], and did eat[^h398] no meat[^h3899] the second[^h8145] day[^h3117] of the month[^h2320]: for he was grieved[^h6087] for David[^h1732], because his father[^h1] had done him shame[^h3637].
###### 35
And it came to pass in the morning[^h1242], that Jonathan[^h3083] went out[^h3318] into the field[^h7704] at the time appointed[^h4150] with David[^h1732], and a little[^h6996] lad[^h5288] with him.
###### 36
And he said[^h559] unto his lad[^h5288], Run[^h7323], find out[^h4672] now the arrows[^h2671] which I shoot[^h3384]. And as the lad[^h5288] ran[^h7323], he shot[^h3384] an arrow[^h2678] beyond[^h5674] him. 
###### 37
And when the lad[^h5288] was come[^h935] to the place[^h4725] of the arrow[^h2678] which Jonathan[^h3083] had shot[^h3384], Jonathan[^h3083] cried[^h7121] after[^h310] the lad[^h5288], and said[^h559], Is not the arrow[^h2678] beyond[^h1973] thee?
###### 38
And Jonathan[^h3083] cried[^h7121] after[^h310] the lad[^h5288], Make speed[^h4120], haste[^h2363], stay[^h5975] not. And Jonathan's[^h3083] lad[^h5288] gathered up[^h3950] the arrows[^h2671] [^h2678], and came[^h935] to his master[^h113].
###### 39
But the lad[^h5288] knew[^h3045] not any thing[^h3972]: only Jonathan[^h3083] and David[^h1732] knew[^h3045] the matter[^h1697].
###### 40
And Jonathan[^h3083] gave[^h5414] his artillery[^h3627] unto his lad[^h5288], and said[^h559] unto him, Go[^h3212], carry[^h935] them to the city[^h5892].  
###### 41
And as soon as the lad[^h5288] was gone[^h935], David[^h1732] arose[^h6965] out of a place toward[^h681] the south[^h5045], and fell[^h5307] on his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776], and bowed[^h7812] himself three[^h7969] times[^h6471]: and they kissed[^h5401] one[^h376] another[^h7453], and wept[^h1058] one[^h376] with another[^h7453], until David[^h1732] exceeded[^h1431].
###### 42
And Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Go[^h3212] in peace[^h7965], forasmuch as we have sworn[^h7650] both[^h8147] of us in the name[^h8034] of the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], The LORD[^h3068] be between me and thee, and between my seed[^h2233] and thy seed[^h2233] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769]. And he arose[^h6965] and departed[^h3212]: and Jonathan[^h3083] went[^h935] into the city[^h5892].

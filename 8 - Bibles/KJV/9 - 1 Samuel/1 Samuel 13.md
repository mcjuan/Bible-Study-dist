###### 1
Saul[^h7586] reigned[^h4427] one year[^h1121] [^h8141]; and when he had reigned[^h4427] two[^h8147] years[^h8141] over Israel[^h3478], 
###### 2
Saul[^h7586] chose[^h977] him three[^h7969] thousand[^h505] men of Israel[^h3478]; whereof two thousand[^h505] were with Saul[^h7586] in Michmash[^h4363] and in mount[^h2022] Bethel[^h1008], and a thousand[^h505] were with Jonathan[^h3129] in Gibeah[^h1390] of Benjamin[^h1144]: and the rest[^h3499] of the people[^h5971] he sent[^h7971] every man[^h376] to his tent[^h168].
###### 3
And Jonathan[^h3129] smote[^h5221] the garrison[^h5333] of the Philistines[^h6430] that was in Geba[^h1387], and the Philistines[^h6430] heard[^h8085] of it. And Saul[^h7586] blew[^h8628] the trumpet[^h7782] throughout all the land[^h776], saying[^h559], Let the Hebrews[^h5680] hear[^h8085]. 
###### 4
And all Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] say[^h559] that Saul[^h7586] had smitten[^h5221] a garrison[^h5333] of the Philistines[^h6430], and that Israel[^h3478] also was had in abomination[^h887] with the Philistines[^h6430]. And the people[^h5971] were called together[^h6817] after[^h310] Saul[^h7586] to Gilgal[^h1537]. 
###### 5
And the Philistines[^h6430] gathered themselves together[^h622] to fight[^h3898] with Israel[^h3478], thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505] chariots[^h7393], and six[^h8337] thousand[^h505] horsemen[^h6571], and people[^h5971] as the sand[^h2344] which is on the sea[^h3220] shore[^h8193] in multitude[^h7230]: and they came up[^h5927], and pitched[^h2583] in Michmash[^h4363], eastward[^h6926] from Bethaven[^h1007].
###### 6
When the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] saw[^h7200] that they were in a strait[^h6887], (for the people[^h5971] were distressed[^h5065],) then the people[^h5971] did hide[^h2244] themselves in caves[^h4631], and in thickets[^h2337], and in rocks[^h5553], and in high places[^h6877], and in pits[^h953].
###### 7
And some of the Hebrews[^h5680] went over[^h5674] Jordan[^h3383] to the land[^h776] of Gad[^h1410] and Gilead[^h1568]. As for Saul[^h7586], he was yet in Gilgal[^h1537], and all the people[^h5971] followed[^h310] him trembling[^h2729]. 
###### 8
And he tarried[^h3176] [^h3176] seven[^h7651] days[^h3117], according to the set time[^h4150] that Samuel[^h8050] had appointed: but Samuel[^h8050] came[^h935] not to Gilgal[^h1537]; and the people[^h5971] were scattered[^h6327] from him.
###### 9
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Bring hither[^h5066] a burnt offering[^h5930] to me, and peace offerings[^h8002]. And he offered[^h5927] the burnt offering[^h5930].
###### 10
And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end[^h3615] of offering[^h5927] the burnt offering[^h5930], behold, Samuel[^h8050] came[^h935]; and Saul[^h7586] went out[^h3318] to meet[^h7125] him, that he might salute[^h1288] him. 
###### 11
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559], What hast thou done[^h6213]? And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Because I saw[^h7200] that the people[^h5971] were scattered[^h5310] from me, and that thou camest[^h935] not within the days[^h3117] appointed[^h4150], and that the Philistines[^h6430] gathered themselves together[^h622] at Michmash[^h4363];
###### 12
Therefore said[^h559] I, The Philistines[^h6430] will come down[^h3381] now upon me to Gilgal[^h1537], and I have not made supplication[^h2470] unto[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]: I forced[^h662] myself therefore, and offered[^h5927] a burnt offering[^h5930]. 
###### 13
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], Thou hast done foolishly[^h5528]: thou hast not kept[^h8104] the commandment[^h4687] of the LORD[^h3068] thy God[^h430], which he commanded[^h6680] thee: for now would the LORD[^h3068] have established[^h3559] thy kingdom[^h4467] upon Israel[^h3478] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 14
But now thy kingdom[^h4467] shall not continue[^h6965]: the LORD[^h3068] hath sought[^h1245] him a man[^h376] after his own heart[^h3824], and the LORD[^h3068] hath commanded[^h6680] him to be captain[^h5057] over his people[^h5971], because thou hast not kept[^h8104] that which the LORD[^h3068] commanded[^h6680] thee.
###### 15
And Samuel[^h8050] arose[^h6965], and gat him up[^h5927] from Gilgal[^h1537] unto Gibeah[^h1390] of Benjamin[^h1144]. And Saul[^h7586] numbered[^h6485] the people[^h5971] that were present[^h4672] with him, about six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376]. 
###### 16
And Saul[^h7586], and Jonathan[^h3129] his son[^h1121], and the people[^h5971] that were present[^h4672] with them, abode[^h3427] in Gibeah[^h1387] of Benjamin[^h1144]: but the Philistines[^h6430] encamped[^h2583] in Michmash[^h4363].  
###### 17
And the spoilers[^h7843] came out[^h3318] of the camp[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430] in three[^h7969] companies[^h7218]: one[^h259] company[^h7218] turned[^h6437] unto the way[^h1870] that leadeth to Ophrah[^h6084], unto the land[^h776] of Shual[^h7777]:
###### 18
And another[^h259] company[^h7218] turned[^h6437] the way[^h1870] to Bethhoron[^h1032]: and another[^h259] company[^h7218] turned[^h6437] to the way[^h1870] of the border[^h1366] that looketh[^h8259] to the valley[^h1516] of Zeboim[^h6650] toward the wilderness[^h4057].
###### 19
Now there was no smith[^h2796] found[^h4672] throughout all the land[^h776] of Israel[^h3478]: for the Philistines[^h6430] said[^h559], Lest the Hebrews[^h5680] make[^h6213] them swords[^h2719] or spears[^h2595]:
###### 20
But all the Israelites[^h3478] went down[^h3381] to the Philistines[^h6430], to sharpen[^h3913] every man[^h376] his share[^h4282], and his coulter[^h855], and his axe[^h7134], and his mattock[^h4281].
###### 21
Yet they had a file[^h6477] [^h6310] for the mattocks[^h4281], and for the coulters[^h855], and for the forks[^h7969] [^h7053], and for the axes[^h7134], and to sharpen[^h5324] the goads[^h1861].  
###### 22
So it came to pass in the day[^h3117] of battle[^h4421], that there was neither sword[^h2719] nor spear[^h2595] found[^h4672] in the hand[^h3027] of any of the people[^h5971] that were with Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3129]: but with Saul[^h7586] and with Jonathan[^h3129] his son[^h1121] was there found[^h4672].
###### 23
And the garrison[^h4673] of the Philistines[^h6430] went out[^h3318] to the passage[^h4569] of Michmash[^h4363].

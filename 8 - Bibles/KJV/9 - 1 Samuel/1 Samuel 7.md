###### 1
And the men[^h582] of Kirjathjearim[^h7157] came[^h935], and fetched up[^h5927] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and brought[^h935] it into the house[^h1004] of Abinadab[^h41] in the hill[^h1389], and sanctified[^h6942] Eleazar[^h499] his son[^h1121] to keep[^h8104] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068].
###### 2
And it came to pass, while[^h3117] the ark[^h727] abode[^h3427] in Kirjathjearim[^h7157], that the time[^h3117] was long[^h7235]; for it was twenty[^h6242] years[^h8141]: and all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478] lamented[^h5091] after[^h310] the LORD[^h3068].
###### 3
And Samuel[^h8050] spake[^h559] unto all the house[^h1004] of Israel[^h3478], saying[^h559], If ye do return[^h7725] unto the LORD[^h3068] with all your hearts[^h3824], then put away[^h5493] the strange[^h5236] gods[^h430] and Ashtaroth[^h6252] from among[^h8432] you, and prepare[^h3559] your hearts[^h3824] unto the LORD[^h3068], and serve[^h5647] him only: and he will deliver[^h5337] you out of the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 4
Then the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] did put away[^h5493] Baalim[^h1168] and Ashtaroth[^h6252], and served[^h5647] the LORD[^h3068] only.
###### 5
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559], Gather[^h6908] all Israel[^h3478] to Mizpeh[^h4708], and I will pray[^h6419] for you unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 6
And they gathered together[^h6908] to Mizpeh[^h4709], and drew[^h7579] water[^h4325], and poured it out[^h8210] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], and fasted[^h6684] on that day[^h3117], and said[^h559] there, We have sinned[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068]. And Samuel[^h8050] judged[^h8199] the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] in Mizpeh[^h4708].
###### 7
And when the Philistines[^h6430] heard[^h8085] that the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were gathered together[^h6908] to Mizpeh[^h4708], the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] went up[^h5927] against Israel[^h3478]. And when the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] heard[^h8085] it, they were afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 8
And the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] said[^h559] to Samuel[^h8050], Cease[^h2790] not to cry[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068] our God[^h430] for us, that he will save[^h3467] us out of the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430]. 
###### 9
And Samuel[^h8050] took[^h3947] a[^h259] sucking[^h2461] lamb[^h2924], and offered[^h5927] it for a burnt offering[^h5930] wholly[^h3632] unto the LORD[^h3068]: and Samuel[^h8050] cried[^h2199] unto the LORD[^h3068] for Israel[^h3478]; and the LORD[^h3068] heard[^h6030] him. 
###### 10
And as Samuel[^h8050] was offering up[^h5927] the burnt offering[^h5930], the Philistines[^h6430] drew near[^h5066] to battle[^h4421] against Israel[^h3478]: but the LORD[^h3068] thundered[^h7481] with a great[^h1419] thunder[^h6963] on that day[^h3117] upon the Philistines[^h6430], and discomfited[^h2000] them; and they were smitten[^h5062] before[^h6440] Israel[^h3478].
###### 11
And the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] went out[^h3318] of Mizpeh[^h4709], and pursued[^h7291] the Philistines[^h6430], and smote[^h5221] them, until they came under Bethcar[^h1033].
###### 12
Then Samuel[^h8050] took[^h3947] a[^h259] stone[^h68], and set[^h7760] it between Mizpeh[^h4709] and Shen[^h8129], and called[^h7121] the name[^h8034] of it Ebenezer[^h72], saying[^h559], Hitherto hath the LORD[^h3068] helped[^h5826] us. 
###### 13
So the Philistines[^h6430] were subdued[^h3665], and they came[^h935] no more[^h3254] into the coast[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]: and the hand[^h3027] of the LORD[^h3068] was against the Philistines[^h6430] all the days[^h3117] of Samuel[^h8050].
###### 14
And the cities[^h5892] which the Philistines[^h6430] had taken[^h3947] from Israel[^h3478] were restored[^h7725] to Israel[^h3478], from Ekron[^h6138] even unto Gath[^h1661]; and the coasts[^h1366] thereof did Israel[^h3478] deliver[^h5337] out of the hands[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430]. And there was peace[^h7965] between Israel[^h3478] and the Amorites[^h567].
###### 15
And Samuel[^h8050] judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] all the days[^h3117] of his life[^h2416].
###### 16
And he went[^h1980] from[^h1767] year[^h8141] to year[^h8141] in circuit[^h5437] to Bethel[^h1008], and Gilgal[^h1537], and Mizpeh[^h4709], and judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478] in all those places[^h4725]. 
###### 17
And his return[^h8666] was to Ramah[^h7414]; for there was his house[^h1004]; and there he judged[^h8199] Israel[^h3478]; and there he built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068].

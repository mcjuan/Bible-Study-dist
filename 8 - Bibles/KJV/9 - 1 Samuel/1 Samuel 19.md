###### 1
And Saul[^h7586] spake[^h1696] to Jonathan[^h3129] his son[^h1121], and to all his servants[^h5650], that they should kill[^h4191] David[^h1732].
###### 2
But Jonathan[^h3083] Saul's[^h7586] son[^h1121] delighted[^h2654] much[^h3966] in David[^h1732]: and Jonathan[^h3083] told[^h5046] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Saul[^h7586] my father[^h1] seeketh[^h1245] to kill[^h4191] thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed[^h8104] to thyself until the morning[^h1242], and abide[^h3427] in a secret[^h5643] place, and hide[^h2244] thyself:
###### 3
And I will go out[^h3318] and stand[^h5975] beside[^h3027] my father[^h1] in the field[^h7704] where thou art, and I will commune[^h1696] with my father[^h1] of thee; and what[^h4100] I see[^h7200], that I will tell[^h5046] thee.
###### 4
And Jonathan[^h3083] spake[^h1696] good[^h2896] of David[^h1732] unto Saul[^h7586] his father[^h1], and said[^h559] unto him, Let not the king[^h4428] sin[^h2398] against his servant[^h5650], against David[^h1732]; because he hath not sinned[^h2398] against thee, and because his works[^h4639] have been to thee-ward very[^h3966] good[^h2896]:
###### 5
For he did put[^h7760] his life[^h5315] in his hand[^h3709], and slew[^h5221] the Philistine[^h6430], and the LORD[^h3068] wrought[^h6213] a great[^h1419] salvation[^h8668] for all Israel[^h3478]: thou sawest[^h7200] it, and didst rejoice[^h8055]: wherefore then wilt thou sin[^h2398] against innocent[^h5355] blood[^h1818], to slay[^h4191] David[^h1732] without a cause[^h2600]?
###### 6
And Saul[^h7586] hearkened[^h8085] unto the voice[^h6963] of Jonathan[^h3083]: and Saul[^h7586] sware[^h7650], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], he shall not[^h518] be slain[^h4191].
###### 7
And Jonathan[^h3083] called[^h7121] David[^h1732], and Jonathan[^h3083] shewed[^h5046] him all those things[^h1697]. And Jonathan[^h3083] brought[^h935] David[^h1732] to Saul[^h7586], and he was in his presence[^h6440], as in times past[^h865] [^h8032]. 
###### 8
And there was war[^h4421] again[^h3254]: and David[^h1732] went out[^h3318], and fought[^h3898] with the Philistines[^h6430], and slew[^h5221] them with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347]; and they fled[^h5127] from[^h6440] him. 
###### 9
And the evil[^h7451] spirit[^h7307] from the LORD[^h3068] was upon Saul[^h7586], as he sat[^h3427] in his house[^h1004] with his javelin[^h2595] in his hand[^h3027]: and David[^h1732] played[^h5059] with his hand[^h3027].
###### 10
And Saul[^h7586] sought[^h1245] to smite[^h5221] David[^h1732] even to the wall[^h7023] with the javelin[^h2595]; but he slipped away[^h6362] out of Saul's[^h7586] presence[^h6440], and he smote[^h5221] the javelin[^h2595] into the wall[^h7023]: and David[^h1732] fled[^h5127], and escaped[^h4422] that night[^h3915].
###### 11
Saul[^h7586] also sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto David's[^h1732] house[^h1004], to watch[^h8104] him, and to slay[^h4191] him in the morning[^h1242]: and Michal[^h4324] David's[^h1732] wife[^h802] told[^h5046] him, saying[^h559], If thou save[^h4422] not thy life[^h5315] to night[^h3915], to morrow[^h4279] thou shalt be slain[^h4191].
###### 12
So Michal[^h4324] let[^h3381] David[^h1732] down[^h3381] through a window[^h2474]: and he went[^h3212], and fled[^h1272], and escaped[^h4422].
###### 13
And Michal[^h4324] took[^h3947] an image[^h8655], and laid[^h7760] it in the bed[^h4296], and put[^h7760] a pillow[^h3523] of goats'[^h5795] hair for his bolster[^h4763], and covered[^h3680] it with a cloth[^h899]. 
###### 14
And when Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to take[^h3947] David[^h1732], she said[^h559], He is sick[^h2470].
###### 15
And Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] the messengers[^h4397] again to see[^h7200] David[^h1732], saying[^h559], Bring him up[^h5927] to me in the bed[^h4296], that I may slay[^h4191] him.
###### 16
And when the messengers[^h4397] were come in[^h935], behold, there was an image[^h8655] in the bed[^h4296], with a pillow[^h3523] of goats'[^h5795] hair for his bolster[^h4763].
###### 17
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto Michal[^h4324], Why hast thou deceived me so[^h7411], and sent away[^h7971] mine enemy[^h341], that he is escaped[^h4422]? And Michal[^h4324] answered[^h559] Saul[^h7586], He said[^h559] unto me, Let me go[^h7971]; why should I kill[^h4191] thee?
###### 18
So David[^h1732] fled[^h1272], and escaped[^h4422], and came[^h935] to Samuel[^h8050] to Ramah[^h7414], and told[^h5046] him all that Saul[^h7586] had done[^h6213] to him. And he and Samuel[^h8050] went[^h3212] and dwelt[^h3427] in Naioth[^h5121].
###### 19
And it was told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586], saying[^h559], Behold, David[^h1732] is at Naioth[^h5121] in Ramah[^h7414].
###### 20
And Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to take[^h3947] David[^h1732]: and when they saw[^h7200] the company[^h3862] of the prophets[^h5030] prophesying[^h5012], and Samuel[^h8050] standing[^h5975] as appointed[^h5324] over them, the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] was upon the messengers[^h4397] of Saul[^h7586], and they also prophesied[^h5012].
###### 21
And when it was told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586], he sent[^h7971] other[^h312] messengers[^h4397], and they prophesied[^h5012] likewise. And Saul[^h7586] sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] again[^h3254] the third[^h7992] time, and they prophesied[^h5012] also.
###### 22
Then went[^h3212] he also to Ramah[^h7414], and came[^h935] to a great[^h1419] well[^h953] that is in Sechu[^h7906]: and he asked[^h7592] and said[^h559], Where[^h375] are Samuel[^h8050] and David[^h1732]? And one said[^h559], Behold, they be at Naioth[^h5121] in Ramah[^h7414].
###### 23
And he went[^h3212] thither to Naioth[^h5121] in Ramah[^h7414]: and the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] was upon him also, and he went[^h3212] on[^h1980], and prophesied[^h5012], until he came[^h935] to Naioth[^h5121] in Ramah[^h7414].
###### 24
And he stripped off[^h6584] his clothes[^h899] also[^h1571], and prophesied[^h5012] before[^h6440] Samuel[^h8050] in like manner, and lay down[^h5307] naked[^h6174] all that day[^h3117] and all that night[^h3915]. Wherefore they say[^h559], Is Saul[^h7586] also among the prophets[^h5030]?

###### 1
And the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] was in the country[^h7704] of the Philistines[^h6430] seven[^h7651] months[^h2320].
###### 2
And the Philistines[^h6430] called[^h7121] for the priests[^h3548] and the diviners[^h7080], saying[^h559], What shall we do[^h6213] to the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068]? tell[^h3045] us wherewith we shall send[^h7971] it to his place[^h4725].
###### 3
And they said[^h559], If ye send away[^h7971] the ark[^h727] of the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], send[^h7971] it not empty[^h7387]; but in any wise[^h7725] return[^h7725] him a trespass offering[^h817]: then ye shall be healed[^h7495], and it shall be known[^h3045] to you why his hand[^h3027] is not removed[^h5493] from you.
###### 4
Then said[^h559] they, What shall be the trespass offering[^h817] which we shall return[^h7725] to him? They answered[^h559], Five[^h2568] golden[^h2091] emerods[^h2914] [^h6076], and five[^h2568] golden[^h2091] mice[^h5909], according to the number[^h4557] of the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430]: for one[^h259] plague[^h4046] was on you all, and on your lords[^h5633]. 
###### 5
Wherefore ye shall make[^h6213] images[^h6754] of your emerods[^h2914] [^h6076], and images[^h6754] of your mice[^h5909] that mar[^h7843] the land[^h776]; and ye shall give[^h5414] glory[^h3519] unto the God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478]: peradventure he will lighten[^h7043] his hand[^h3027] from off you, and from off your gods[^h430], and from off your land[^h776].
###### 6
Wherefore then do ye harden[^h3513] your hearts[^h3824], as the Egyptians[^h4714] and Pharaoh[^h6547] hardened[^h3513] their hearts[^h3820]? when he had wrought wonderfully[^h5953] among them, did they not let the people go[^h7971], and they departed[^h3212]?  
###### 7
Now therefore make[^h6213] a[^h259] new[^h2319] cart[^h5699], and take[^h3947] two[^h8147] milch[^h5763] kine[^h6510], on which there hath come[^h5927] no yoke[^h5923], and tie[^h631] the kine[^h6510] to the cart[^h5699], and bring[^h7725] their calves[^h1121] home[^h1004] from them[^h310]:
###### 8
And take[^h3947] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and lay[^h5414] it upon the cart[^h5699]; and put[^h7760] the jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091], which ye return[^h7725] him for a trespass offering[^h817], in a coffer[^h712] by the side[^h6654] thereof; and send it away[^h7971], that it may go[^h1980].
###### 9
And see[^h7200], if it goeth up[^h5927] by the way[^h1870] of his own coast[^h1366] to Bethshemesh[^h1053], then he hath done[^h6213] us this great[^h1419] evil[^h7451]: but if not, then we shall know[^h3045] that it is not his hand[^h3027] that smote[^h5060] us: it was a chance[^h4745] that happened to us[^h1961]. 
###### 10
And the men[^h582] did so[^h6213]; and took[^h3947] two[^h8147] milch[^h5763] kine[^h6510], and tied[^h631] them to the cart[^h5699], and shut up[^h3607] their calves[^h1121] at home[^h1004]:
###### 11
And they laid[^h7760] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068] upon the cart[^h5699], and the coffer[^h712] with the mice[^h5909] of gold[^h2091] and the images[^h6754] of their emerods[^h2914].
###### 12
And the kine[^h6510] took the straight[^h3474] way[^h1870] to the way[^h1870] of Bethshemesh[^h1053], and went along[^h1980] the highway[^h4546] [^h259], lowing[^h1600] as they went[^h1980], and turned not aside[^h5493] to the right hand[^h3225] or to the left[^h8040]; and the lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] went[^h1980] after[^h310] them unto the border[^h1366] of Bethshemesh[^h1053].
###### 13
And they of Bethshemesh[^h1053] were reaping[^h7114] their wheat[^h2406] harvest[^h7105] in the valley[^h6010]: and they lifted up[^h5375] their eyes[^h5869], and saw[^h7200] the ark[^h727], and rejoiced[^h8055] to see[^h7200] it.
###### 14
And the cart[^h5699] came[^h935] into the field[^h7704] of Joshua[^h3091], a Bethshemite[^h1030], and stood[^h5975] there, where there was a great[^h1419] stone[^h68]: and they clave[^h1234] the wood[^h6086] of the cart[^h5699], and offered[^h5927] the kine[^h6510] a burnt offering[^h5930] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 15
And the Levites[^h3881] took down[^h3381] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], and the coffer[^h712] that was with it, wherein the jewels[^h3627] of gold[^h2091] were, and put[^h7760] them on the great[^h1419] stone[^h68]: and the men[^h582] of Bethshemesh[^h1053] offered[^h5927] burnt offerings[^h5930] and sacrificed[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] the same day[^h3117] unto the LORD[^h3068].
###### 16
And when the five[^h2568] lords[^h5633] of the Philistines[^h6430] had seen[^h7200] it, they returned[^h7725] to Ekron[^h6138] the same day[^h3117].
###### 17
And these are the golden[^h2091] emerods[^h2914] which the Philistines[^h6430] returned[^h7725] for a trespass offering[^h817] unto the LORD[^h3068]; for Ashdod[^h795] one[^h259], for Gaza[^h5804] one[^h259], for Askelon[^h831] one[^h259], for Gath[^h1661] one[^h259], for Ekron[^h6138] one[^h259];
###### 18
And the golden[^h2091] mice[^h5909], according to the number[^h4557] of all the cities[^h5892] of the Philistines[^h6430] belonging to the five[^h2568] lords[^h5633], both of fenced[^h4013] cities[^h5892], and of country[^h6521] villages[^h3724], even unto the great[^h1419] stone of Abel[^h59], whereon they set down[^h3240] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068]: which stone remaineth unto this day[^h3117] in the field[^h7704] of Joshua[^h3091], the Bethshemite[^h1030]. 
###### 19
And he smote[^h5221] the men[^h376] of Bethshemesh[^h1053], because they had looked[^h7200] into the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068], even he smote[^h5221] of the people[^h5971] fifty[^h2572] thousand[^h505] and threescore and ten[^h7657] men[^h582]: and the people[^h5971] lamented[^h56], because the LORD[^h3068] had smitten[^h5221] many of the people[^h5971] with a great[^h1419] slaughter[^h4347].
###### 20
And the men[^h582] of Bethshemesh[^h1053] said[^h559], Who is able[^h3201] to stand[^h5975] before[^h6440] this holy[^h6918] LORD[^h3068] God[^h430]? and to whom shall he go up[^h5927] from us?
###### 21
And they sent[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] to the inhabitants[^h3427] of Kirjathjearim[^h7157], saying[^h559], The Philistines[^h6430] have brought again[^h7725] the ark[^h727] of the LORD[^h3068]; come ye down[^h3381], and fetch it up[^h5927] to you.

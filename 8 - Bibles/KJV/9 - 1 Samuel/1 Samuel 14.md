###### 1
Now it came to pass upon a day[^h3117], that Jonathan[^h3129] the son[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto the young man[^h5288] that bare[^h5375] his armour[^h3627], Come[^h3212], and let us go over[^h5674] to the Philistines'[^h6430] garrison[^h4673], that is on the other side[^h5676] [^h1975]. But he told[^h5046] not his father[^h1]. 
###### 2
And Saul[^h7586] tarried[^h3427] in the uttermost[^h7097] part of Gibeah[^h1390] under a pomegranate tree[^h7416] which is in Migron[^h4051]: and the people[^h5971] that were with him were about six[^h8337] hundred[^h3967] men[^h376];
###### 3
And Ahiah[^h281], the son[^h1121] of Ahitub[^h285], Ichabod's[^h350] brother[^h251], the son[^h1121] of Phinehas[^h6372], the son[^h1121] of Eli[^h5941], the LORD'S[^h3068] priest[^h3548] in Shiloh[^h7887], wearing[^h5375] an ephod[^h646]. And the people[^h5971] knew[^h3045] not that Jonathan[^h3129] was gone[^h1980]. 
###### 4
And between the passages[^h4569], by which Jonathan[^h3129] sought[^h1245] to go over[^h5674] unto the Philistines'[^h6430] garrison[^h4673], there was a sharp[^h8127] rock[^h5553] on the one side[^h5676], and a sharp[^h8127] rock[^h5553] on the other side[^h5676]: and the name[^h8034] of the one[^h259] was Bozez[^h949], and the name[^h8034] of the other[^h259] Seneh[^h5573].
###### 5
The forefront[^h8127] of the one[^h259] was situate[^h4690] northward[^h6828] over against[^h4136] Michmash[^h4363], and the other[^h259] southward[^h5045] over against[^h4136] Gibeah[^h1387]. 
###### 6
And Jonathan[^h3083] said[^h559] to the young man[^h5288] that bare[^h5375] his armour[^h3627], Come[^h3212], and let us go over[^h5674] unto the garrison[^h4673] of these uncircumcised[^h6189]: it may be that the LORD[^h3068] will work[^h6213] for us: for there is no restraint[^h4622] to the LORD[^h3068] to save[^h3467] by many[^h7227] or by few[^h4592].
###### 7
And his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] said[^h559] unto him, Do[^h6213] all that is in thine heart[^h3824]: turn[^h5186] thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart[^h3824].
###### 8
Then said[^h559] Jonathan[^h3083], Behold, we will pass over[^h5674] unto these men[^h582], and we will discover[^h1540] ourselves unto them.
###### 9
If they say[^h559] thus unto us, Tarry[^h1826] until we come[^h5060] to you; then we will stand still[^h5975] in our place, and will not go up[^h5927] unto them. 
###### 10
But if they say[^h559] thus, Come up[^h5927] unto us; then we will go up[^h5927]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] them into our hand[^h3027]: and this shall be a sign[^h226] unto us.
###### 11
And both[^h8147] of them discovered[^h1540] themselves unto the garrison[^h4673] of the Philistines[^h6430]: and the Philistines[^h6430] said[^h559], Behold, the Hebrews[^h5680] come forth[^h3318] out of the holes[^h2356] where they had hid[^h2244] themselves.
###### 12
And the men[^h582] of the garrison[^h4675] answered[^h6030] Jonathan[^h3129] and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], and said[^h559], Come up[^h5927] to us, and we will shew[^h3045] you a thing[^h1697]. And Jonathan[^h3129] said[^h559] unto his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627], Come up[^h5927] after[^h310] me: for the LORD[^h3068] hath delivered[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 13
And Jonathan[^h3129] climbed up[^h5927] upon his hands[^h3027] and upon his feet[^h7272], and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] after[^h310] him: and they fell[^h5307] before[^h6440] Jonathan[^h3129]; and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] slew[^h4191] after[^h310] him.
###### 14
And that first[^h7223] slaughter[^h4347], which Jonathan[^h3129] and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] made[^h5221], was about twenty[^h6242] men[^h376], within as it were an half[^h2677] acre[^h4618] of land[^h7704], which a yoke[^h6776] of oxen might plow. 
###### 15
And there was trembling[^h2731] in the host[^h4264], in the field[^h7704], and among all the people[^h5971]: the garrison[^h4673], and the spoilers[^h7843], they also trembled[^h2729], and the earth[^h776] quaked[^h7264]: so it was a very great[^h430] trembling[^h2731]. 
###### 16
And the watchmen[^h6822] of Saul[^h7586] in Gibeah[^h1390] of Benjamin[^h1144] looked[^h7200]; and, behold, the multitude[^h1995] melted away[^h4127], and they went[^h3212] on beating down[^h1986] one another.
###### 17
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586] unto the people[^h5971] that were with him, Number[^h6485] now, and see[^h7200] who is gone[^h1980] from us. And when they had numbered[^h6485], behold, Jonathan[^h3129] and his armourbearer[^h5375] [^h3627] were not there.
###### 18
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto Ahiah[^h281], Bring hither[^h5066] the ark[^h727] of God[^h430]. For the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] was at that time[^h3117] with the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478].
###### 19
And it came to pass, while Saul[^h7586] talked[^h1696] unto the priest[^h3548], that the noise[^h1995] that was in the host[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430] went[^h3212] on[^h1980] and increased[^h7227]: and Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto the priest[^h3548], Withdraw[^h622] thine hand[^h3027]. 
###### 20
And Saul[^h7586] and all the people[^h5971] that were with him assembled[^h2199] themselves, and they came[^h935] to the battle[^h4421]: and, behold, every man's[^h376] sword[^h2719] was against his fellow[^h7453], and there was a very[^h3966] great[^h1419] discomfiture[^h4103]. 
###### 21
Moreover the Hebrews[^h5680] that were with the Philistines[^h6430] before[^h865] that time[^h8032], which went up[^h5927] with them into the camp[^h4264] from the country round about[^h5439], even they also turned to be with the Israelites[^h3478] that were with Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3129].
###### 22
Likewise all the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] which had hid[^h2244] themselves in mount[^h2022] Ephraim[^h669], when they heard[^h8085] that the Philistines[^h6430] fled[^h5127], even they also followed hard[^h1692] after[^h310] them in the battle[^h4421].
###### 23
So the LORD[^h3068] saved[^h3467] Israel[^h3478] that day[^h3117]: and the battle[^h4421] passed over[^h5674] unto Bethaven[^h1007].
###### 24
And the men[^h376] of Israel[^h3478] were distressed[^h5065] that day[^h3117]: for Saul[^h7586] had adjured[^h422] the people[^h5971], saying[^h559], Cursed[^h779] be the man[^h376] that eateth[^h398] any food[^h3899] until evening[^h6153], that I may be avenged[^h5358] on mine enemies[^h341]. So none of the people[^h5971] tasted[^h2938] any food[^h3899].
###### 25
And all they of the land[^h776] came[^h935] to a wood[^h3293]; and there was honey[^h1706] upon[^h6440] the ground[^h7704].
###### 26
And when the people[^h5971] were come[^h935] into the wood[^h3293], behold, the honey[^h1706] dropped[^h1982]; but no man put[^h5381] his hand[^h3027] to his mouth[^h6310]: for the people[^h5971] feared[^h3372] the oath[^h7621].
###### 27
But Jonathan[^h3129] heard[^h8085] not when his father[^h1] charged[^h7650] the people[^h5971] with the oath[^h7650]: wherefore he put forth[^h7971] the end[^h7097] of the rod[^h4294] that was in his hand[^h3027], and dipped[^h2881] it in an honeycomb[^h3295] [^h1706], and put[^h7725] his hand[^h3027] to his mouth[^h6310]; and his eyes[^h5869] were enlightened[^h215].
###### 28
Then answered[^h6030] one[^h376] of the people[^h5971], and said[^h559], Thy father[^h1] straitly[^h7650] charged[^h7650] the people[^h5971] with an oath[^h7650], saying[^h559], Cursed[^h779] be the man[^h376] that eateth[^h398] any food[^h3899] this day[^h3117]. And the people[^h5971] were faint[^h5774]. 
###### 29
Then said[^h559] Jonathan[^h3129], My father[^h1] hath troubled[^h5916] the land[^h776]: see[^h7200], I pray you, how mine eyes[^h5869] have been enlightened[^h215], because I tasted[^h2938] a little[^h4592] of this honey[^h1706].
###### 30
How much more[^h637], if haply[^h3863] the people[^h5971] had eaten[^h398] freely[^h398] to day[^h3117] of the spoil[^h7998] of their enemies[^h341] which they found[^h4672]? for had there not been now a much greater[^h7235] slaughter[^h4347] among the Philistines[^h6430]?
###### 31
And they smote[^h5221] the Philistines[^h6430] that day[^h3117] from Michmash[^h4363] to Aijalon[^h357]: and the people[^h5971] were very[^h3966] faint[^h5774].
###### 32
And the people[^h5971] flew[^h5860] [^h6213] upon the spoil[^h7998], and took[^h3947] sheep[^h6629], and oxen[^h1241], and calves[^h1121], and slew[^h7819] them on the ground[^h776]: and the people[^h5971] did eat[^h398] them with the blood[^h1818].
###### 33
Then they told[^h5046] Saul[^h7586], saying[^h559], Behold, the people[^h5971] sin[^h2398] against the LORD[^h3068], in that they eat[^h398] with the blood[^h1818]. And he said[^h559], Ye have transgressed[^h898]: roll[^h1556] a great[^h1419] stone[^h68] unto me this day[^h3117]. 
###### 34
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Disperse[^h6327] yourselves among the people[^h5971], and say[^h559] unto them, Bring me hither[^h5066] every man[^h376] his ox[^h7794], and every man[^h376] his sheep[^h7716], and slay[^h7819] them here, and eat[^h398]; and sin[^h2398] not against the LORD[^h3068] in eating[^h398] with the blood[^h1818]. And all the people[^h5971] brought[^h5066] every man[^h376] his ox[^h7794] with him[^h3027] that night[^h3915], and slew[^h7819] them there. 
###### 35
And Saul[^h7586] built[^h1129] an altar[^h4196] unto the LORD[^h3068]: the same was the first[^h2490] altar[^h4196] that he built[^h1129] unto the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 36
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Let us go down[^h3381] after[^h310] the Philistines[^h6430] by night[^h3915], and spoil[^h962] them until the morning[^h1242] light[^h216], and let us not leave[^h7604] a man[^h376] of them. And they said[^h559], Do[^h6213] whatsoever seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto thee. Then said[^h559] the priest[^h3548], Let us draw near[^h7126] hither[^h1988] unto God[^h430].
###### 37
And Saul[^h7586] asked[^h7592] counsel of God[^h430], Shall I go down[^h3381] after[^h310] the Philistines[^h6430]? wilt thou deliver[^h5414] them into the hand[^h3027] of Israel[^h3478]? But he answered[^h6030] him not that day[^h3117].
###### 38
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Draw ye near[^h5066] hither[^h1988], all the chief[^h6438] of the people[^h5971]: and know[^h3045] and see[^h7200] wherein[^h4100] this sin[^h2403] hath been this day[^h3117]. 
###### 39
For, as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], which saveth[^h3467] Israel[^h3478], though it be[^h3426] in Jonathan[^h3129] my son[^h1121], he shall surely[^h4191] die[^h4191]. But there was not a man among all the people[^h5971] that answered[^h6030] him.
###### 40
Then said[^h559] he unto all Israel[^h3478], Be ye on one[^h259] side[^h5676], and I and Jonathan[^h3129] my son[^h1121] will be on the other[^h259] side[^h5676]. And the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], Do[^h6213] what seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto thee.
###### 41
Therefore Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] unto the LORD[^h3068] God[^h430] of Israel[^h3478], Give[^h3051] a perfect[^h8549] lot. And Saul[^h7586] and Jonathan[^h3129] were taken[^h3920]: but the people[^h5971] escaped[^h3318].  
###### 42
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], Cast[^h5307] lots between me and Jonathan[^h3129] my son[^h1121]. And Jonathan[^h3129] was taken[^h3920].
###### 43
Then Saul[^h7586] said[^h559] to Jonathan[^h3129], Tell[^h5046] me what thou hast done[^h6213]. And Jonathan[^h3129] told[^h5046] him, and said[^h559], I did but[^h2938] taste[^h2938] a little[^h4592] honey[^h1706] with the end[^h7097] of the rod[^h4294] that was in mine hand[^h3027], and, lo[^h2009], I must die[^h4191].
###### 44
And Saul[^h7586] answered[^h559], God[^h430] do so[^h6213] and more also[^h3254]: for thou shalt surely[^h4191] die[^h4191], Jonathan[^h3129].
###### 45
And the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], Shall Jonathan[^h3129] die[^h4191], who hath wrought[^h6213] this great[^h1419] salvation[^h3444] in Israel[^h3478]? God forbid[^h2486]: as the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], there shall not one hair[^h8185] of his head[^h7218] fall[^h5307] to the ground[^h776]; for he hath wrought[^h6213] with God[^h430] this day[^h3117]. So the people[^h5971] rescued[^h6299] Jonathan[^h3129], that he died[^h4191] not.
###### 46
Then Saul[^h7586] went up[^h5927] from following[^h310] the Philistines[^h6430]: and the Philistines[^h6430] went[^h1980] to their own place[^h4725].
###### 47
So Saul[^h7586] took[^h3920] the kingdom[^h4410] over Israel[^h3478], and fought[^h3898] against all his enemies[^h341] on every side[^h5439], against Moab[^h4124], and against the children[^h1121] of Ammon[^h5983], and against Edom[^h123], and against the kings[^h4428] of Zobah[^h6678], and against the Philistines[^h6430]: and whithersoever he turned[^h6437] himself, he vexed[^h7561] them.
###### 48
And he gathered[^h6213] an host[^h2428], and smote[^h5221] the Amalekites[^h6002], and delivered[^h5337] Israel[^h3478] out of the hands[^h3027] of them that spoiled[^h8154] them. 
###### 49
Now the sons[^h1121] of Saul[^h7586] were Jonathan[^h3129], and Ishui[^h3440], and Melchishua[^h4444]: and the names[^h8034] of his two[^h8147] daughters[^h1323] were these; the name[^h8034] of the firstborn[^h1067] Merab[^h4764], and the name[^h8034] of the younger[^h6996] Michal[^h4324]:
###### 50
And the name[^h8034] of Saul's[^h7586] wife[^h802] was Ahinoam[^h293], the daughter[^h1323] of Ahimaaz[^h290]: and the name[^h8034] of the captain[^h8269] of his host[^h6635] was Abner[^h74], the son[^h1121] of Ner[^h5369], Saul's[^h7586] uncle[^h1730]. 
###### 51
And Kish[^h7027] was the father[^h1] of Saul[^h7586]; and Ner[^h5369] the father[^h1] of Abner[^h74] was the son[^h1121] of Abiel[^h22].
###### 52
And there was sore[^h2389] war[^h4421] against the Philistines[^h6430] all the days[^h3117] of Saul[^h7586]: and when Saul[^h7586] saw[^h7200] any strong[^h1368] man[^h376], or any valiant[^h2428] man[^h1121], he took[^h622] him unto him.

###### 1
And the child[^h5288] Samuel[^h8050] ministered[^h8334] unto the LORD[^h3068] before[^h6440] Eli[^h5941]. And the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] was precious[^h3368] in those days[^h3117]; there was no open[^h6555] vision[^h2377].
###### 2
And it came to pass at that time[^h3117], when Eli[^h5941] was laid down[^h7901] in his place[^h4725], and his eyes[^h5869] began[^h2490] to wax dim[^h3544], that he could[^h3201] not see[^h7200];
###### 3
And ere the lamp[^h5216] of God[^h430] went out[^h3518] in the temple[^h1964] of the LORD[^h3068], where the ark[^h727] of God[^h430] was, and Samuel[^h8050] was laid down[^h7901] to sleep;
###### 4
That the LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] Samuel[^h8050]: and he answered[^h559], Here am I.
###### 5
And he ran[^h7323] unto Eli[^h5941], and said[^h559], Here am I[^h2009]; for thou calledst[^h7121] me. And he said[^h559], I called[^h7121] not; lie down[^h7901] again[^h7725]. And he went[^h3212] and lay down[^h7901].
###### 6
And the LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] yet again[^h3254], Samuel[^h8050]. And Samuel[^h8050] arose[^h6965] and went[^h3212] to Eli[^h5941], and said[^h559], Here am I; for thou didst call[^h7121] me. And he answered[^h559], I called[^h7121] not, my son[^h1121]; lie down[^h7901] again[^h7725].
###### 7
Now Samuel[^h8050] did not yet[^h2962] know[^h3045] the LORD[^h3068], neither was the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068] yet revealed[^h1540] unto him. 
###### 8
And the LORD[^h3068] called[^h7121] Samuel[^h8050] again[^h3254] the third time[^h7992]. And he arose[^h6965] and went[^h3212] to Eli[^h5941], and said[^h559], Here am I; for thou didst call[^h7121] me. And Eli[^h5941] perceived[^h995] that the LORD[^h3068] had called[^h7121] the child[^h5288].
###### 9
Therefore Eli[^h5941] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], Go[^h3212], lie down[^h7901]: and it shall be, if he call[^h7121] thee, that thou shalt say[^h559], Speak[^h1696], LORD[^h3068]; for thy servant[^h5650] heareth[^h8085]. So Samuel[^h8050] went[^h3212] and lay down[^h7901] in his place[^h4725].
###### 10
And the LORD[^h3068] came[^h935], and stood[^h3320], and called[^h7121] as at other times[^h6471], Samuel[^h8050], Samuel[^h8050]. Then Samuel[^h8050] answered[^h559], Speak[^h1696]; for thy servant[^h5650] heareth[^h8085].
###### 11
And the LORD[^h3068] said[^h559] to Samuel[^h8050], Behold, I will do[^h6213] a thing[^h1697] in Israel[^h3478], at which both[^h8147] the ears[^h241] of every one that heareth[^h8085] it shall tingle[^h6750].
###### 12
In that day[^h3117] I will perform[^h6965] against Eli[^h5941] all things which I have spoken[^h1696] concerning[^h413] his house[^h1004]: when I begin[^h2490], I will also make an end[^h3615]. 
###### 13
For I have told[^h5046] him that I will judge[^h8199] his house[^h1004] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769] for the iniquity[^h5771] which he knoweth[^h3045]; because his sons[^h1121] made themselves vile[^h7043], and he restrained[^h3543] them not.   
###### 14
And therefore I have sworn[^h7650] unto the house[^h1004] of Eli[^h5941], that the iniquity[^h5771] of Eli's[^h5941] house[^h1004] shall not be purged[^h3722] with sacrifice[^h2077] nor offering[^h4503] for[^h5704] ever[^h5769].
###### 15
And Samuel[^h8050] lay[^h7901] until the morning[^h1242], and opened[^h6605] the doors[^h1817] of the house[^h1004] of the LORD[^h3068]. And Samuel[^h8050] feared[^h3372] to shew[^h5046] Eli[^h5941] the vision[^h4759].
###### 16
Then Eli[^h5941] called[^h7121] Samuel[^h8050], and said[^h559], Samuel[^h8050], my son[^h1121]. And he answered[^h559], Here am I.
###### 17
And he said[^h559], What is the thing[^h1697] that the LORD hath said[^h1696] unto thee? I pray thee hide[^h3582] it not from me: God[^h430] do so[^h6213] to thee, and more also[^h3254], if thou hide[^h3582] any thing[^h1697] from me of all the things[^h1697] that he said[^h1696] unto thee.  
###### 18
And Samuel[^h8050] told[^h5046] him every whit[^h1697], and hid[^h3582] nothing from him. And he said[^h559], It is the LORD[^h3068]: let him do[^h6213] what seemeth[^h5869] him good[^h2896]. 
###### 19
And Samuel[^h8050] grew[^h1431], and the LORD[^h3068] was with him, and did let none of his words[^h1697] fall[^h5307] to the ground[^h776].
###### 20
And all Israel[^h3478] from Dan[^h1835] even to Beersheba[^h884] knew[^h3045] that Samuel[^h8050] was established[^h539] to be a prophet[^h5030] of the LORD[^h3068]. 
###### 21
And the LORD[^h3068] appeared[^h7200] again[^h3254] in Shiloh[^h7887]: for the LORD[^h3068] revealed[^h1540] himself to Samuel[^h8050] in Shiloh[^h7887] by the word[^h1697] of the LORD[^h3068].

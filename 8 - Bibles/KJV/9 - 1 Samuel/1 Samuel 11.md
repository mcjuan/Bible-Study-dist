###### 1
Then Nahash[^h5176] the Ammonite[^h5984] came up[^h5927], and encamped[^h2583] against Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568]: and all the men[^h582] of Jabesh[^h3003] said[^h559] unto Nahash[^h5176], Make[^h3772] a covenant[^h1285] with us, and we will serve[^h5647] thee.
###### 2
And Nahash[^h5176] the Ammonite[^h5984] answered[^h559] them, On this[^h2063] condition will I make[^h3772] a covenant with you, that I may thrust out[^h5365] all your right[^h3225] eyes[^h5869], and lay[^h7760] it for a reproach[^h2781] upon all Israel[^h3478].
###### 3
And the elders[^h2205] of Jabesh[^h3003] said[^h559] unto him, Give us seven[^h7651] days'[^h3117] respite[^h7503], that we may send[^h7971] messengers[^h4397] unto all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478]: and then, if there be no man to save[^h3467] us, we will come out[^h3318] to thee. 
###### 4
Then came[^h935] the messengers[^h4397] to Gibeah[^h1390] of Saul[^h7586], and told[^h1696] the tidings[^h1697] in the ears[^h241] of the people[^h5971]: and all the people[^h5971] lifted up[^h5375] their voices[^h6963], and wept[^h1058].
###### 5
And, behold, Saul[^h7586] came[^h935] after[^h310] the herd[^h1241] out of the field[^h7704]; and Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], What aileth the people[^h5971] that they weep[^h1058]? And they told[^h5608] him the tidings[^h1697] of the men[^h582] of Jabesh[^h3003].
###### 6
And the Spirit[^h7307] of God[^h430] came[^h6743] upon Saul[^h7586] when he heard[^h8085] those tidings[^h1697], and his anger[^h639] was kindled[^h2734] greatly[^h3966].
###### 7
And he took[^h3947] a yoke[^h6776] of oxen[^h1241], and hewed them in pieces[^h5408], and sent[^h7971] them throughout all the coasts[^h1366] of Israel[^h3478] by the hands[^h3027] of messengers[^h4397], saying[^h559], Whosoever cometh not forth[^h3318] after[^h310] Saul[^h7586] and after[^h310] Samuel[^h8050], so shall it be done[^h6213] unto his oxen[^h1241]. And the fear[^h6343] of the LORD[^h3068] fell[^h5307] on the people[^h5971], and they came out[^h3318] with one[^h259] consent[^h376]. 
###### 8
And when he numbered[^h6485] them in Bezek[^h966], the children[^h1121] of Israel[^h3478] were three[^h7969] hundred[^h3967] thousand[^h505], and the men[^h376] of Judah[^h3063] thirty[^h7970] thousand[^h505].
###### 9
And they said[^h559] unto the messengers[^h4397] that came[^h935], Thus shall ye say[^h559] unto the men[^h376] of Jabeshgilead[^h3003] [^h1568], To morrow[^h4279], by that time the sun[^h8121] be hot[^h2527], ye shall have help[^h8668]. And the messengers[^h4397] came[^h935] and shewed[^h5046] it to the men[^h582] of Jabesh[^h3003]; and they were glad[^h8055]. 
###### 10
Therefore the men[^h582] of Jabesh[^h3003] said[^h559], To morrow[^h4279] we will come out[^h3318] unto you, and ye shall do[^h6213] with us all that seemeth[^h5869] good[^h2896] unto you.
###### 11
And it was so on the morrow[^h4283], that Saul[^h7586] put[^h7760] the people[^h5971] in three[^h7969] companies[^h7218]; and they came[^h935] into the midst[^h8432] of the host[^h4264] in the morning[^h1242] watch[^h821], and slew[^h5221] the Ammonites[^h5983] until the heat[^h2527] of the day[^h3117]: and it came to pass, that they which remained[^h7604] were scattered[^h6327], so that two[^h8147] of them were not left[^h7604] together[^h3162].
###### 12
And the people[^h5971] said[^h559] unto Samuel[^h8050], Who is he that said[^h559], Shall Saul[^h7586] reign[^h4427] over us? bring[^h5414] the men[^h582], that we may put them to death[^h4191].
###### 13
And Saul[^h7586] said[^h559], There shall not a man[^h376] be put to death[^h4191] this day[^h3117]: for to day[^h3117] the LORD[^h3068] hath wrought[^h6213] salvation[^h8668] in Israel[^h3478].
###### 14
Then said[^h559] Samuel[^h8050] to the people[^h5971], Come[^h3212], and let us go[^h3212] to Gilgal[^h1537], and renew[^h2318] the kingdom[^h4410] there.
###### 15
And all the people[^h5971] went[^h3212] to Gilgal[^h1537]; and there they made Saul[^h7586] king[^h4427] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068] in Gilgal[^h1537]; and there they sacrificed[^h2076] sacrifices[^h2077] of peace offerings[^h8002] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and there Saul[^h7586] and all the men[^h582] of Israel[^h3478] rejoiced[^h8055] greatly[^h3966].

###### 1
And it came to pass in those days[^h3117], that the Philistines[^h6430] gathered[^h6908] their armies[^h4264] together[^h6908] for warfare[^h6635], to fight[^h3898] with Israel[^h3478]. And Achish[^h397] said[^h559] unto David[^h1732], Know[^h3045] thou assuredly[^h3045], that thou shalt go out[^h3318] with me to battle[^h4264], thou and thy men[^h582].
###### 2
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] to Achish[^h397], Surely[^h3651] thou shalt know[^h3045] what thy servant[^h5650] can do[^h6213]. And Achish[^h397] said[^h559] to David[^h1732], Therefore will I make[^h7760] thee keeper[^h8104] of mine head[^h7218] for ever[^h3117].
###### 3
Now Samuel[^h8050] was dead[^h4191], and all Israel[^h3478] had lamented[^h5594] him, and buried[^h6912] him in Ramah[^h7414], even in his own city[^h5892]. And Saul[^h7586] had put away[^h5493] those that had familiar spirits[^h178], and the wizards[^h3049], out of the land[^h776].
###### 4
And the Philistines[^h6430] gathered themselves together[^h6908], and came[^h935] and pitched[^h2583] in Shunem[^h7766]: and Saul[^h7586] gathered[^h6908] all Israel[^h3478] together[^h6908], and they pitched[^h2583] in Gilboa[^h1533].
###### 5
And when Saul[^h7586] saw[^h7200] the host[^h4264] of the Philistines[^h6430], he was afraid[^h3372], and his heart[^h3820] greatly[^h3966] trembled[^h2729].
###### 6
And when Saul[^h7586] enquired[^h7592] of the LORD[^h3068], the LORD[^h3068] answered[^h6030] him not, neither by dreams[^h2472], nor by Urim[^h224], nor by prophets[^h5030].
###### 7
Then said[^h559] Saul[^h7586] unto his servants[^h5650], Seek[^h1245] me a woman[^h802] that hath[^h1172] a familiar spirit[^h178], that I may go[^h3212] to her, and enquire[^h1875] of her. And his servants[^h5650] said[^h559] to him, Behold, there is a woman[^h802] that hath[^h1172] a familiar spirit[^h178] at Endor[^h5874].
###### 8
And Saul[^h7586] disguised[^h2664] himself, and put on[^h3847] other[^h312] raiment[^h899], and he went[^h3212], and two[^h8147] men[^h582] with him, and they came[^h935] to the woman[^h802] by night[^h3915]: and he said[^h559], I pray thee, divine[^h7080] unto me by the familiar spirit[^h178], and bring me him up[^h5927], whom I shall name[^h559] unto thee.
###### 9
And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto him, Behold, thou knowest[^h3045] what Saul[^h7586] hath done[^h6213], how he hath cut off[^h3772] those that have familiar spirits[^h178], and the wizards[^h3049], out of the land[^h776]: wherefore then layest thou a snare[^h5367] for my life[^h5315], to cause me to die[^h4191]?
###### 10
And Saul[^h7586] sware[^h7650] to her by the LORD[^h3068], saying[^h559], As the LORD[^h3068] liveth[^h2416], there shall[^h518] no punishment[^h5771] happen[^h7136] to thee for this thing[^h1697].
###### 11
Then said[^h559] the woman[^h802], Whom shall I bring up[^h5927] unto thee? And he said[^h559], Bring me up[^h5927] Samuel[^h8050].
###### 12
And when the woman[^h802] saw[^h7200] Samuel[^h8050], she cried[^h2199] with a loud[^h1419] voice[^h6963]: and the woman[^h802] spake[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], saying[^h559], Why hast thou deceived[^h7411] me? for thou art Saul[^h7586].
###### 13
And the king[^h4428] said[^h559] unto her, Be not afraid[^h3372]: for what sawest[^h7200] thou? And the woman[^h802] said[^h559] unto Saul[^h7586], I saw[^h7200] gods[^h430] ascending[^h5927] out of the earth[^h776].
###### 14
And he said[^h559] unto her, What form[^h8389] is he of? And she said[^h559], An old[^h2205] man[^h376] cometh up[^h5927]; and he is covered[^h5844] with a mantle[^h4598]. And Saul[^h7586] perceived[^h3045] that it was Samuel[^h8050], and he stooped[^h6915] with his face[^h639] to the ground[^h776], and bowed[^h7812] himself. 
###### 15
And Samuel[^h8050] said[^h559] to Saul[^h7586], Why hast thou disquieted[^h7264] me, to bring me up[^h5927]? And Saul[^h7586] answered[^h559], I am sore[^h3966] distressed[^h6887]; for the Philistines[^h6430] make war[^h3898] against me, and God[^h430] is departed[^h5493] from me, and answereth[^h6030] me no more, neither by[^h3027] prophets[^h5030], nor by dreams[^h2472]: therefore I have called[^h7121] thee, that thou mayest make known[^h3045] unto me what I shall do[^h6213]. 
###### 16
Then said[^h559] Samuel[^h8050], Wherefore then dost thou ask[^h7592] of me, seeing the LORD[^h3068] is departed[^h5493] from thee, and is become thine enemy[^h6145]?
###### 17
And the LORD[^h3068] hath done[^h6213] to him, as he spake[^h1696] by me[^h3027]: for the LORD[^h3068] hath rent[^h7167] the kingdom[^h4467] out of thine hand[^h3027], and given[^h5414] it to thy neighbour[^h7453], even to David[^h1732]:  
###### 18
Because[^h834] thou obeyedst[^h8085] not the voice[^h6963] of the LORD[^h3068], nor executedst[^h6213] his fierce[^h2740] wrath[^h639] upon Amalek[^h6002], therefore hath the LORD[^h3068] done[^h6213] this thing[^h1697] unto thee this day[^h3117].
###### 19
Moreover the LORD[^h3068] will also deliver[^h5414] Israel[^h3478] with thee into the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430]: and to morrow[^h4279] shalt thou and thy sons[^h1121] be with me: the LORD[^h3068] also shall deliver[^h5414] the host[^h4264] of Israel[^h3478] into the hand[^h3027] of the Philistines[^h6430].
###### 20
Then Saul[^h7586] fell[^h5307] straightway[^h4116] all[^h4393] along[^h6967] on the earth[^h776], and was sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372], because of the words[^h1697] of Samuel[^h8050]: and there was no strength[^h3581] in him; for he had eaten[^h398] no bread[^h3899] all the day[^h3117], nor all the night[^h3915]. 
###### 21
And the woman[^h802] came[^h935] unto Saul[^h7586], and saw[^h7200] that he was sore[^h3966] troubled[^h926], and said[^h559] unto him, Behold, thine handmaid[^h8198] hath obeyed[^h8085] thy voice[^h6963], and I have put[^h7760] my life[^h5315] in my hand[^h3709], and have hearkened[^h8085] unto thy words[^h1697] which thou spakest[^h1696] unto me.
###### 22
Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken[^h8085] thou also unto the voice[^h6963] of thine handmaid[^h8198], and let me set[^h7760] a morsel[^h6595] of bread[^h3899] before[^h6440] thee; and eat[^h398], that thou mayest have strength[^h3581], when thou goest[^h3212] on thy way[^h1870].
###### 23
But he refused[^h3985], and said[^h559], I will not eat[^h398]. But his servants[^h5650], together with the woman[^h802], compelled[^h6555] him; and he hearkened[^h8085] unto their voice[^h6963]. So he arose[^h6965] from the earth[^h776], and sat[^h3427] upon the bed[^h4296].
###### 24
And the woman[^h802] had a fat[^h4770] calf[^h5695] in the house[^h1004]; and she hasted[^h4116], and killed[^h2076] it, and took[^h3947] flour[^h7058], and kneaded[^h3888] it, and did bake[^h644] unleavened bread[^h4682] thereof:
###### 25
And she brought[^h5066] it before[^h6440] Saul[^h7586], and before[^h6440] his servants[^h5650]; and they did eat[^h398]. Then they rose up[^h6965], and went away[^h3212] that night[^h3915].

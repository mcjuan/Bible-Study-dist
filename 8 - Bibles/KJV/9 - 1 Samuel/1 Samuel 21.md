###### 1
Then came[^h935] David[^h1732] to Nob[^h5011] to Ahimelech[^h288] the priest[^h3548]: and Ahimelech[^h288] was afraid[^h2729] at the meeting[^h7125] of David[^h1732], and said[^h559] unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man[^h376] with thee?
###### 2
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Ahimelech[^h288] the priest[^h3548], The king[^h4428] hath commanded[^h6680] me a business[^h1697], and hath said[^h559] unto me, Let no man[^h376] know[^h3045] any thing[^h3972] of the business[^h1697] whereabout I send[^h7971] thee, and what I have commanded[^h6680] thee: and I have appointed[^h3045] my servants[^h5288] to such[^h6423] and such[^h492] a place[^h4725].
###### 3
Now therefore what is[^h3426] under thine hand[^h3027]? give[^h5414] me five[^h2568] loaves of bread[^h3899] in mine hand[^h3027], or what there is present[^h4672]. 
###### 4
And the priest[^h3548] answered[^h6030] David[^h1732], and said[^h559], There is no common[^h2455] bread[^h3899] under mine hand[^h3027], but there is[^h3426] hallowed[^h6944] bread[^h3899]; if the young men[^h5288] have kept[^h8104] themselves at least[^h389] from women[^h802].
###### 5
And David[^h1732] answered[^h6030] the priest[^h3548], and said[^h559] unto him, Of a truth[^h518] women[^h802] have been kept[^h6113] from us about these three[^h8032] days[^h8543], since I came out[^h3318], and the vessels[^h3627] of the young men[^h5288] are holy[^h6944], and the bread is in a manner[^h1870] common[^h2455], yea, though it were sanctified[^h6942] this day[^h3117] in the vessel[^h3627]. 
###### 6
So the priest[^h3548] gave[^h5414] him hallowed[^h6944] bread: for there was no bread[^h3899] there but the shewbread[^h3899] [^h6440], that was taken[^h5493] from before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068], to put[^h7760] hot[^h2527] bread[^h3899] in the day[^h3117] when it was taken away[^h3947].
###### 7
Now a certain man[^h376] of the servants[^h5650] of Saul[^h7586] was there that day[^h3117], detained[^h6113] before[^h6440] the LORD[^h3068]; and his name[^h8034] was Doeg[^h1673], an Edomite[^h130], the chiefest[^h47] of the herdmen[^h7462] that belonged to Saul[^h7586].
###### 8
And David[^h1732] said[^h559] unto Ahimelech[^h288], And is there[^h3426] not[^h371] here under thine hand[^h3027] spear[^h2595] or sword[^h2719]? for I have neither brought[^h3947] my sword[^h2719] nor my weapons[^h3627] with me[^h3027], because the king's[^h4428] business[^h1697] required[^h1961] haste[^h5169].
###### 9
And the priest[^h3548] said[^h559], The sword[^h2719] of Goliath[^h1555] the Philistine[^h6430], whom thou slewest[^h5221] in the valley[^h6010] of Elah[^h425], behold, it is here wrapped[^h3874] in a cloth[^h8071] behind[^h310] the ephod[^h646]: if thou wilt take[^h3947] that, take[^h3947] it: for there is no other[^h312] save[^h2108] that here[^h2088]. And David[^h1732] said[^h559], There is none like that; give[^h5414] it me.
###### 10
And David[^h1732] arose[^h6965], and fled[^h1272] that day[^h3117] for fear[^h6440] of Saul[^h7586], and went[^h935] to Achish[^h397] the king[^h4428] of Gath[^h1661].
###### 11
And the servants[^h5650] of Achish[^h397] said[^h559] unto him, Is not this David[^h1732] the king[^h4428] of the land[^h776]? did they not sing[^h6030] one to another of him[^h2088] in dances[^h4246], saying[^h559], Saul[^h7586] hath slain[^h5221] his thousands[^h505], and David[^h1732] his ten thousands[^h7233]?
###### 12
And David[^h1732] laid up[^h7760] these words[^h1697] in his heart[^h3824], and was sore[^h3966] afraid[^h3372] of[^h6440] Achish[^h397] the king[^h4428] of Gath[^h1661].
###### 13
And he changed[^h8138] his behaviour[^h2940] before[^h5869] them, and feigned himself mad[^h1984] in their hands[^h3027], and scrabbled[^h8427] on the doors[^h1817] of the gate[^h8179], and let his spittle[^h7388] fall down[^h3381] upon his beard[^h2206]. 
###### 14
Then said[^h559] Achish[^h397] unto his servants[^h5650], Lo, ye see[^h7200] the man[^h376] is mad[^h7696]: wherefore then have ye brought[^h935] him to me? 
###### 15
Have I need[^h2638] of mad men[^h7696], that ye have brought[^h935] this fellow to play the mad man[^h7696] in my presence? shall this fellow come[^h935] into my house[^h1004]?

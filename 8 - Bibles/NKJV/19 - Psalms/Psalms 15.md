###### 1
*A Psalm of David.*  </i> LORD, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill?
###### 2
He who walks uprightly, And works righteousness, And speaks the truth in his heart;
###### 3
He *who* does not backbite with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor,  Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;
###### 4
In whose eyes a vile person is despised, But he honors those who fear the LORD; He *who* swears to his own hurt and does not change;
###### 5
He *who* does not put out his money at usury, Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these *things* shall never be moved.

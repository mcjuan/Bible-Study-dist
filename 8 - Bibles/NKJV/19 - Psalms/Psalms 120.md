###### 1
*A Song of Ascents.*  </i> In my distress I cried to the LORD, And He heard me.
###### 2
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips *And* from a deceitful tongue.
###### 3
What shall be given to you, Or what shall be done to you, You false tongue?
###### 4
Sharp arrows of the warrior, With coals of the broom tree!
###### 5
Woe is me, that I dwell in Meshech,  *That* I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
###### 6
My soul has dwelt too long With one who hates peace.
###### 7
I *am* *for* peace; But when I speak, they *are* for war.

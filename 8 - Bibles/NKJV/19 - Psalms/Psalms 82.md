###### 1
*A Psalm of Asaph.*  </i> God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods.
###### 2
How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked?  *Selah*
###### 3
Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy.
###### 4
Deliver the poor and needy; Free *them* from the hand of the wicked.
###### 5
They do not know, nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are unstable.
###### 6
I said, “You *are* gods, And all of you *are* children of the Most High.
###### 7
But you shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes.”
###### 8
Arise, O God, judge the earth;  For You shall inherit all nations.

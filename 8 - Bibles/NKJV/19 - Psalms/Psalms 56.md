###### 1
*To the Chief Musician. Set to “The Silent Dove in Distant Lands.” A Michtam of David when the Philistines captured him in Gath.*  </i> Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up; Fighting all day he oppresses me.
###### 2
My enemies would hound *me* all day, For *there* *are* many who fight against me, O Most High.
###### 3
Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in You.
###### 4
In God (I will praise His word), In God I have put my trust;  I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?
###### 5
All day they twist my words; All their thoughts *are* against me for evil.
###### 6
They gather together, They hide, they mark my steps, When they lie in wait for my life.
###### 7
Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God!
###### 8
You number my wanderings; Put my tears into Your bottle;  *Are* *they* not in Your book?
###### 9
When I cry out *to* *You,* Then my enemies will turn back; This I know, because God *is* for me.
###### 10
In God (I will praise *His* word), In the LORD (I will praise *His* word),
###### 11
In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
###### 12
Vows *made* to You *are* *binding* upon me, O God; I will render praises to You,
###### 13
For You have delivered my soul from death. *Have* *You* not *kept* my feet from falling, That I may walk before God In the light of the living?

###### 1
*A Song of Ascents.*  </i> When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion,  We were like those who dream.
###### 2
Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, “The LORD has done great things for them.”
###### 3
The LORD has done great things for us, *And* we are glad.
###### 4
Bring back our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South.
###### 5
Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.
###### 6
He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves *with* *him.*

###### 1
*A Song of Ascents.*  </i> Unto You I lift up my eyes, O You who dwell in the heavens.
###### 2
Behold, as the eyes of servants *look* to the hand of their masters, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,  So our eyes *look* to the LORD our God, Until He has mercy on us.
###### 3
Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us! For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
###### 4
Our soul is exceedingly filled With the scorn of those who are at ease, With the contempt of the proud.

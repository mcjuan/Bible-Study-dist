###### 1
*A Psalm of David.*  </i> The LORD *is* my shepherd;  I shall not want.
###### 2
He makes me to lie down in green pastures;  He leads me beside the still waters.
###### 3
He restores my soul;  He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name’s sake.
###### 4
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil;  For You *are* with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.
###### 5
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over.
###### 6
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever.
